[{"document": "The lovelorn ballad only reached number 108, but it set the \"dirt poor\" Tennessee singer on the path to fame.\nSince then, she's sold more than 100 million albums, topped the country chart 25 times, and won eight Grammy Awards - but she shows no signs of slowing down.\n\"Almost every day I come up with a few song titles or a sweet melody,\" says the 70-year-old, who claims to have written more than 3,000 songs in her career.\nHer latest album, Pure & Simple, came out on Friday, featuring new songs with stripped-down arrangements that recall the early days of her career.\nIt has an overwhelmingly romantic theme, inspired by renewing her wedding vows earlier this year. And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.", "summary": "It is 50 years since Dolly Parton first entered the US charts, with a cover of The Tune Weavers' Happy, Happy Birthday Baby.", "id": "37131104", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "100 words.\nCountry music star Dolly Parton on her new album, Pure & Simple\nDolly Parton: 'I'm not a country singer'\nDolly Parton: 'I'm not a country singer' Country music star Dolly Parton on her new album, Pure & Simple\nDolly Parton: 'I'm not a country singer' Country music star Dolly Parton on her new album, Pure & Simple", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "100 words.\n\u00bb More Music News\n\u00bb More Music\n\u00bb More Music Interviews\n\u00bb More Music Features\n\u00bb More Music Features on the BBC News website\n\u00bb More Music Features on the BBC News app\n\u00bb More Music Features on the BBC News website\n\u00bb More Music Features on the BBC News app\n\u00bb More Music Features on the BBC News website.\n\u00bb More Music Features on the BBC News app.\n\u00bb More Music Fe", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nYou can listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds.\nYou can listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds.\nYou can listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds.

having beaten the Edinburgh side in the League Cup - to move into third place behind their opponents on goal difference.\nTo add to Hearts' disappointment, head coach Robbie Neilson was sent to the stand as his side pressed for that elusive leveller.\nAnd Celtic now have a chance to extend their lead to five points with a game in hand when they travel to face Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Sunday.\nThe Hearts head scratching will go on for some time after what was a dominant display, but they had one man to blame for their defeat - goalkeeper Clark.\nClark has been standing in for the injured Alan Mannus, but his display was such that manager Tommy Wright will have a tough decision to make when his number one is fit and ready for action.\nThe 24-year-old pulled off two top-class, close-range saves in the first half - stage first from Faycal Rherras and the second from Sam Nicolson, who should have done better from six yards out.\nAs Hearts piled forward in the second half, he also denied Igor Rossi and then tipped a Tony Watt free kick over the bar.\nClark walked off the pitch to thankful back slaps from his team, respectful handshakes from the visitors and the fans singing his name.\nSt Johnstone under Tommy Wright have become a very difficult team to beat and even harder when they go ahead.\nEvery player knows his job and their organisation and work rate is consistent and impressive - and against Hearts it was no different.\nHearts' Robbie Neilson started with Sam Nicolson and Jamie Walker on the wings in a bid to stretch the match and flood the box with crosses.\nIn that sense, his game plan worked, but the Saints defence fought for every ball, challenged every cross and chased every lost cause.\nAfter going ahead, they were doggedly determined to stay there and it was a frustrating afternoon for those in maroon.\nThe build-up to the match was dominated by Wright's comments about Hearts players going to ground too easily - and he said in the minutes before kick-off that he stood by his stance.\nThe Irishman was left looking rather sheepish though after two of his players were booked for simulation.\nGoalscorer Cummins, in the first half, and substitute Chris Kane were both cautioned by referee John Beaton.\nNeilson resisted the temptation to gloat, although he had his own problems after being sent to the stand.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We can get results like that through sheer determination and quality goalkeeping and a desire not to let the ball go in the net from everybody in the team, hard work, the odd wee bit of quality, probably not as much as I would like.\n\"A hard-fought win and it is a perfect one for a manager - a clean sheet and getting a goal at the other end.\n\"I've got two number one goalkeepers - that's rare at football clubs and, having been a goalkeeper, I know that.\n\"Over the last six months, Zander has improved immensely and I don't think there is a better young goalkeeper in Scotland and I think he should be in and around that Scotland squad.\"\nHearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \"I spoke to the players after the game and said we played some fantastic football and created some wonderful chances.\n\"But we didn't take them and got done with a sucker punch, but I'd rather play like that and be entertaining and exciting and create chances than go direct and hope to nick a goal.\n\"I thought we played really well to a man, but we just couldn't get the win our play deserved.\n\"The St Johnstone goalkeeper has some wonderful saves and probably had the game of his life.\"\nMatch ends, St. Johnstone 1, Heart of Midlothian 0.\nSecond Half ends, St. Johnstone 1, Heart of Midlothian 0.\nAttempt missed.

Tomorrow he heads to Estonia.\nSerious presidential candidates seem obligated to make a trip abroad to prove their foreign policy mettle, but when it comes to such overseas adventures, boring is pretty close to a best-case outcome.\nSome might recall the sunny day seven years ago, when then-Senator Barack Obama delivered an address in Berlin to an adoring crowd numbering in the hundreds of thousands. More often, however, candidates don't soar on foreign soil, they stumble.\nWithin the past year Governors Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal have all wilted under the harsh spotlight of the world stage. And then there was Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's ill-fated 2012 trip to Europe, where he generated numerous negative headlines, including ruffling British feathers when he wondered if London was prepared to host that summer's Olympic Games.\nIt's the kind of stuff that gives campaign hands nightmares - particularly the small group of experts and academics who are tasked with educating and counselling presidential candidates on international affairs.\nEliot Cohen, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, advised Mr Romney on foreign policy in 2012. He says the campaign made the mistake of bringing only a \"very tight personal staff\" to Europe with the former Massachusetts governor.\n\"It's very hard not to stumble,\" he says. Aside from incumbent presidents running for re-election, candidates have little in the way of international affairs support staff. Campaign organisations are mostly composed of political operatives and domestic policy experts, and full-time foreign policy advisors tend to be far fewer in number and often with less experience.\nAlthough campaigns bring in outside advisors - releasing lists of names with some fanfare - he says the amount of time they get on a candidate's schedule is limited.\n\"If you don't have that kind of massive staff working for you, it's so easy to walk into some kind of bog - people just sink in without a trace,\" Cohen says.\n\"What I would have advised on that particular trip is just say nice things about the Olympics, that's all,\" he adds. \"It was an unforced error.\"\nAccording to veteran foreign policy hands who've joined the political fray to help prospective commanders-in-chief, avoiding such unforced errors on foreign policy - as well as developing an overarching international vision - are the primary goals when they sit down with their charges.\nFormer US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton says that \"almost every candidate needs to know more about national security\".\n\"The real issue is whether their background, their combination of interest, experience and involvement, gives them an opportunity to exercise an informed judgement,\" he continues. \"Ultimately the most important thing a president needs is not facts, but judgement.\"\nMr Bolton, who flirted with his own presidential bid this year, has worked with numerous Republican candidates, including Mr Romney in 2012. His name has been linked to Mr Jindal's campaign, and in February he was overheard having foreign policy discussions over dinner with Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\"Some have specific questions that they want to talk about,\" Bolton says of the candidates he advises. \"Others just kind of want to go around the world and so on. Some have specific questions about how a president makes decisions, who they want to talk to and how it works.\"\nThe current crop of presidential hopefuls offers a wide range of levels of foreign policy interest and experience. On one end are candidates like Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Republican Lindsey Graham, a veteran of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nOthers, like Mr Walker of Wisconsin, have little foreign policy experience. He was roundly criticised earlier this year, for instance, when responded to a question about how he'd deal with the Islamic State by comparing it to his confrontations with the public employee unions in his home state.\nAccording to Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings institution senior fellow who advised Mrs Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign, good foreign policy aides need to tailor their approach to the particular candidate's experience - and also their personality.\n\"Some people are going to welcome more assertive advice than others,\" he says. \"It's one thing if you've known the candidate for 20 years. It's something else if you're trying to get to know them through this process. If you want to do the latter, then you've got to interact at the pace and the level that they're comfortable with.\"\nWhen the candidate has a solid resume in international affairs - like George HW Bush in 1988, for instance - an advisor may just be honoured to be invited into the room.\n\"It's not so much of an educational process as it is a team where maybe one person is following an issue in more detail, but the candidate ultimately has pretty good confidence and judgement and even quite a bit of knowledge about the issue at hand,\" he says.\nIn other cases, advisers have to provide a more in-depth education - \"fill in the scaffolding and figure out how to handle a lot of other issues and just develop some talking points\", he says. At the very least the goal is to prevent a candidate from getting blindsided in debates or from reporters springing unexpected 'pop quizzes' - as a Boston reporter did of then-candidate George W Bush in 1999.\nAnd then there are the times when \"foreign policy advisers\" don't really do all that much advising, O'Hanlon says.\nCampaigns release a list of names on their foreign policy team, but those individuals may never get any time with the candidate. Instead, they're brought on board to satisfy particular political constituencies.\n\"Sometimes the campaigns get built up and the advisors get recruited just to keep them feeling part of the team,\" he says. \"You don't want people to feel dissed or unwanted. So if there's a group that is talented and knowledgeable, maybe you just want to have them on standby and not lose them to somebody else.\"\nSuch an approach isn't without risks, of course. Reporters and opponents often pore over the announcements and hints of campaign advisors, looking for an angle for a story or a line to attack.\nJeb Bush, for instance, made it easy on his foes when word leaked that during a private meeting he named his presidential brother as one of his top Middle East advisers.\nAnd Jeb Bush's attempts to distance himself from his brother's controversies took another a hit in May when he included 17 former members of his brother's administration on his list of foreign policy advisers, including outspoken Iraq War architect Paul Wolfowitz.\nIt's conventional wisdom that, unless there's a war or major international crises, foreign policy usually takes a back seat to domestic concerns during US presidential elections - so candidate stumbles up to this point may eventually fade into the background.\nAt least thus far, however, international affairs - particularly the Obama administration's handling of Iran, Israel and the Islamic State - have been regular topics of discussion among almost all of the Republican presidential aspirants.\nIn many ways this is turning out to be a different kind of Republican presidential race - from the level of money pouring in to the sheer number of entrants. And perhaps the campaign will be different in its level of emphasis on foreign policy, as well.\nThe more the candidates talk about events overseas, the more influence the often-overlooked foreign policy advisors will wield.\n\"This is what I wanted, this is what I hoped for, this is what I predicted really,\" Bolton says of the candidates' new-found emphasis on world events.\n\"If people want to talk, I'm delighted to talk with them,\" he says, in what could be a foreign policy adviser's credo.\n2016 Republican presidential hopefuls in - and out - of the race", "summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush is wrapping up his trip through Europe, and it seems the worst thing being said about his visit (at least so far) is that he's been a bit boring.", "id": "33099085", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

It was difficult in the beginning because Lee (McCulloch) obviously set his team out very tight in their organisation in a real low position and that's always difficult to break down.\n\"But we showed quality and great patience and I must say big applause as well to the crowd because they're now seeing what we're trying to do - they're not getting frustrated, they're understanding at times they're going to have to be patient.\n\"Our only mistake was for the goal which was the counter attack but every other element we showed a lovely charisma in the game today. We got three goals and with a bit more luck we could have had another one or two.\"\nInterim Kilmarnock boss Lee McCulloch: \"I thought first half we were too deep, stood off the game too much and allowed Celtic a little bit too much respect. Second half we changed the system and decided to go a little bit higher up the pitch.\n\"I'm delighted with the way the boys played and the character and concentration they showed for most of the game.\n\"We get back in the game and gather a little bit of momentum then we just switch off for a set play as we have done a couple of times this season - that's the most disappointing part of the day.\n\"Did we deserve to win then game - absolutely not. But I'm proud of the way the boys showed character and passed the ball, especially in the second half at times and maybe on another day we could have stolen a point.\"\nMatch ends, Celtic 3, Kilmarnock 1.\nSecond Half ends, Celtic 3, Kilmarnock 1.\nFoul by Scott Brown (Celtic).\nAdam Frizzell (Kilmarnock) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nCorner,  Celtic.

Many don't even have wi-fi - naturally, this was not a concern for Orwell.\nIn 2005 only one - The Butcher's Arms at Herne in Kent - was in existence, with only a handful around the UK in 2010, but the popularity has exploded in recent years, with  the Micropubs Association saying 162 establishments were up and running by the end of 2015.\nMartyn Hillier, who still runs The Butcher's Arms and was awarded last year by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) for his role in reviving pubs, said the reasons for their success were similar to the principles laid out by Orwell.\n\"When I started the concept people asked what the rules are, and it's basically about having a good pub that gets everyone talking to each other,\" he said.\n\"It's all about selling good beer and meeting interesting people.\"\nFour years after opening his pub in an old butcher's shop, Mr Hillier gave a presentation at Camra's annual general meeting in Eastbourne, where he showed people how easily they could set up micropubs.\nThe talk proved influential, and since then micropubs have popped up in former barbers, post offices and other empty premises.\nTansy Harrison and Graham \"Grum\" Newbury, who also hail from Kent, opened Bridge Street Ale House in a former antiques shop in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, in the summer of 2014, having previously run bigger pubs for larger pub-owning companies.\nIt was the first micropub to open in North Staffordshire, and has since been followed by three more, all of which focus on real ale, cider and encouraging conversation.\nMr Newbury says the move has been a success founded on sticking to the principles of \"proper\" pub fans, and giving licensees a better chance at achieving a balance between work and their private lives.\n\"All I want in a pub is a guarantee the beers are good, I don't have to be looking over my shoulder and I don't have to compete with a TV or jukebox,\" he said.\n\"With everything these days people can just stay at home and entertain themselves with films, computer games or whatever - people come to the pub for social interaction.\"\nThe rise of micropubs has been welcomed by Camra, which has been campaigning for more pubs to focus on traditional cask beer for more than 40 years.\nTim Page, chief executive of the organisation, sees direct links between them and the cherished ideals of Orwell.\n\"Much of what he was describing is characteristic of what micropubs seek to represent,\" he said.\nAccording to Camra, 29 pubs are closing across the UK every week, down from more than 50 about 10 years ago.\nMr Page sees the rise of micropubs as \"a positive development\" after many troubling years for the industry.\nEchoes of the Moon Under Water may be visible in the modern micropub, but how do the pubs that helped inspire the author 70 years ago fare when compared to his criteria today?\nLizzie Arnold is the manager of the Hen and Chickens Theatre Bar in Islington, one of several back-street London pubs used by Orwell to come up with his criteria for the perfect pub.\nIt may play music on the weekend, but she says its focus on atmosphere and beer means its old patron would still enjoy it.\n\"It's always busy in here, it can get quite crazy, but we don't do food and we've got a good few regulars. I like it that way,\" she said.\n\"People come here for the atmosphere, they don't come in shouting or whatever, even on match-days [Arsenal's stadium is nearby].\"\nSeven decades on not all of Orwell's ideas on pubs have endured: the smoking ban has done for the tobacco-stained roofs of old, few pubs sell aspirin behind the counter (though some double up as village shops), and boiled jam rolls have fallen out of culinary favour.\nHowever, Mr Hillier hopes the micropub's focus on quality beer and a convivial atmosphere will continue in much the same way as Orwell set out in his 1946 essay.\n\"At first I didn't know that much about the history of pubs, so it was quite interesting to see that I related to what he was saying,\" he said.\n\"I'm just going back to how pubs used to be.\"\nFor DJ Taylor, Orwell's attachment to his own era - not to mention a contrarian streak - makes it difficult to predict if we would have seen him in a micropub, a pink china mug of stout in hand.\n\"He was very much a traditionalist when it came to licensed premises,\" he said.\n\"It's hard to say what he would have thought about them, but he would have certainly taken a serious interest.\"\nAnd regardless of whether Orwell would have approved of the micropub, Mr Page believes that its future is rosy.\n\"The pub is a really great meeting place, because it's one of the few places where people can go that goes across the class divide,\" he said.\n\"It's more than a place to go and have a drink - that's what Orwell was saying, and it's what micropubs are saying.\"", "summary": "Seventy years after George Orwell published an essay on what makes the perfect pub, BBC News examines how the author's views are influencing the micropub movement.", "id": "35235234", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

At home, its political crackdown puts it increasingly at odds with British values.\nShould any of this matter? The UK already has a Chinese company, Huawei, running key parts of its telecommunications network.\nArguably nuclear energy is likewise a business relationship subject to similar national security safeguards.\nBut led by the United States, several other western countries have barred Huawei's involvement in key telecommunications networks on national security grounds.\nAnd no other major developed economy has invited Chinese involvement in a key nuclear energy project.\nTwo years ago the German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked her Australian counterpart what drove his country's policy on China, and he answered \"fear and greed\".\nIn the absence of political change in China, this blunt assessment sums up the calculus for many countries, though the exact proportions of each differ depending on circumstance.\nSome in the British political and security establishment felt that under the previous government's declared \"golden era\" with China, there was not enough fear in London and too much greed.\nOne such was the prime minister's joint chief of staff Nick Timothy.\nIn comments which have received enormous scrutiny since Thursday night's surprise announcement that the Hinkley Point deal would be delayed, Mr Timothy wrote last October on the eve of the Chinese president's state visit to the UK:\n\"Security experts - reportedly inside as well as outside government - are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will\u2026\n\"MI5 believes that 'the intelligence services of\u2026 China\u2026 continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad'.\"\nAccording to the former Business Secretary Vince Cable, the then home secretary did raise national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet.\nSir Vince described Mrs May as \"unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time\".\nInterestingly, Mrs May's less \"gung ho\" attitude on China was already evident in another dimension.\nAs home secretary, she intervened personally when it emerged that the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei had been granted only a 20-day visa to launch his exhibition at London's Royal Academy.\nMs May overturned that decision, ordered a six-month visa and apologised to Mr Ai.\nSo perhaps we will see a more nuanced policy to China under this new government.\nBut this, too, is hard to get right.\nSome in the business and political community will remind Mrs May that her predecessor learned early what it was to feel Beijing's wrath when he ignored Chinese protests and met the Dalai Lama in 2012.\nAs a result, no senior figure in the British government was invited to China for the following 18 months - and when Mr Cameron did finally visit, it was after George Osborne had wrested control of UK-China policy from the more cautious Foreign Office to launch what he called \"the next big step\", a very business-oriented relationship which culminated in President Xi's state visit to the UK last October.\nIt's worth remembering that the Hinkley Point deal was the centrepiece of that visit, the symbol of the \"golden era\" in relations that both governments hoped to launch.\nAnd Beijing has good reason for investing political capital in the nuclear energy relationship.\nChina has more than 30 nuclear power stations at home and nearly as many under construction.\nExporting its nuclear technology is now the priority, and although it has customers like Pakistan in the developing world, the UK's track record and internationally respected safety regime would make it a hugely valuable showcase.\nChina's embassy in London said on Saturday that Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point is a \"win-win\", and UK enthusiasts insists Chinese technology is cheap and safe and that China has too much at stake to want to \"shut down Britain's energy production at will\", as Mr Timothy put it.\nBut if at the end of her review, Mrs May does decide she's unsure about future Chinese intentions and wants to renegotiate, what will happen?\nCould she have Chinese investment for Hinkley Point without any strings attached about a Chinese-designed and built nuclear power station down the line?\nAt this point, we just don't know, but one answer may be no, and if she then walks away, she risks making China angry.\nNow that would cause problems for another stated government goal.\nMrs May is only prime minister because of the Brexit vote, and in a world where the UK stands outside the European Union, it may want to work harder at its economic relationship China.\nLast weekend, Chancellor Philip Hammond was in Beijing and raised the possibility of a free trade agreement.\nIf Chinese pique over a reverse on nuclear energy landed the British government back on what many in Whitehall called China's \"naughty step\", trade negotiations would go into the freezer and howls of protest would follow from those in the business community who were hoping to realise Mr Osborne's \"golden decade\" in economic relations.\nIt's possible that Mrs May won't get to this point in her reassessment, but if she does, she may reflect that if China is minded to exact a price for a change of heart on a business deal, the price for other differences of opinion might become unacceptably high if the same China was in control of a British nuclear power station.\nWhich then brings the prime minister to the question of how other world leaders manage difficulties in their relationship with China.\nSize and strategic dominance puts the United States in a different class, but there's an interesting model closer to home.\nThe German Chancellor Angela Merkel manages to have a close and profitable business relationship with Beijing at the same time as being much more robust in defence of German interests, and much more vocal on other issues like China's territorial assertiveness and its crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech.\nIn Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, Chinese leaders have grown used to British partners who kept most differences behind closed doors, whether on steel dumping, Hong Kong, locking up lawyers or the South China Sea.\nIt would be an ironic twist if one result of the Brexit vote was a reset of UK China policy which put that policy back in line with its more robust EU partners.\nA month ago, Brexit looked like one set of problems for China, mostly focused on economic fears. Now with her Hinkley Point pause, Ms May has delivered a wholly new set of problems.\nBut while Chinese leaders may not like the unpredictable and inconvenient U-turns in policy and style that come with messy democracies, they are increasingly adept at handling them.\nFrom the United States to Sri Lanka and Myanmar, Beijing plays a long and pragmatic game when it comes to new governments.\nSo China liked the Cameron-Osborne team and got used to the chancellor calling the tune on UK-China policy.\nBut with this signal that key decision making has moved from No 11 to No 10 Downing St, Beijing will be working hard to map the players in the May team, and when the prime minister finishes her assessment of the Hinkley Point deal and announces the outcome, you can be sure Beijing will be ready for her.", "summary": "In explaining its shock decision to delay the deal on Hinkley Point, the government said it needed time to consider all components of the deal, but speculation is growing that China questions may be at the heart of the reassessment.", "id": "36937511", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

Do you agree with it? Choose your own from a shortlist compiled by BBC Sport journalists.\nPick your XI from our list and share with your friends.\nThere seems to be a correlation between Kasper Schmeichel being in goal and Leicester City keeping clean sheets.\nThey haven't kept that many this season and that's probably why the Foxes are mightily relieved to have their number one back between the sticks.\nInjuries are an occupational hazard for any footballer, and some might argue you can't enjoy the full experience of top-flight football until you have felt the misery of a long-term injury and the sheer euphoria of the return.\nOf course Kasper's father Peter (an infinitely better keeper, by the way) would have schooled him in the arts of football survival. Considering the way Leicester have been defending this season, that may come in very handy.\nI was very tempted to select Bournemouth's Simon Francis at right-back, but I was so impressed with Manchester United's comeback that I had to go for Antonio Valencia.\nThe game against Middlesbrough was going away from United and they needed a few cool heads to see them through. If there is one player they can count on, it's Valencia. The full-back is as safe as houses.\nValencia was one of those players who shut the game down for United once they got their noses in front.\nIn the final minutes, Valencia had no hesitation launching the ball into the crowd in order to relieve the pressure and kill the game. Sometimes even exceptional defenders can't afford to be too proud to do what needs be done.\nWhat a thumping header by the Chelsea captain.\nVictory over Stoke made it 13 consecutive wins for the Blues and there was a touch of inevitability about the outcome of this match. Did anyone really believe Stoke could pull this off?\nTo be fair, the Potters went to Stamford Bridge and gave the Blues a game and were even the better side in the early exchanges, but there was only one winner.\nIt's not common for Stoke to concede goals from a corner but the way in which a Chelsea quartet descended upon Cesc Fabregas' beautiful floated corner was like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\nI've never before seen a Stoke defence bulldozed down like that on a set-play. It was Cahill who scored the goal but it was Chelsea's heavy mob that contributed to Stoke's total destruction.\nIt has been some time since Wes Morgan made my team of the week. Last season he was practically ever-present, but Leicester's preoccupation with the Champions League seems to have created a Premier League paralysis.\nHowever, against a stubborn West Ham they managed a rare clean sheet, which was the basis upon which last season's title success.\nClaudio Ranieri's celebration at the end of this fixture was telling enough, and without these three points Leicester would have been in big trouble.\nMorgan's contribution was central to their clean sheet and it was just as well.\nJames Milner is making me eat my words. When I saw him in Liverpool's worst performance of the season against Burnley, I accused the England man of being a square peg in a round hole.\nA right-footed midfield player playing left-back? He looked awkward and was exposed.\nAdmittedly his team-mates weren't much help that day, but since then he has grown into the part beautifully.\nHe has been Liverpool's best player during the past four games and never gave Manchester City's Raheem Sterling a kick on his return to Anfield.\nIn fact, the battle between Milner and Sterling was the highlight of the game for me. It was like a throwback to the 1970s, when you had players like George Best and Ron Harris going at it for 90 minutes, only without the brutality. I must admit, Jurgen Klopp has certainly got that one right.\nIt's been a great Christmas period for Paul Pogba. He was inspirational against Sunderland and a match-winner against Middlesbrough.\nPlease don't think for one minute that his header against Boro that gave United all three points was easy. He didn't panic and steered the ball in the only place Victor Valdes could not retrieve it.\nI've seen those last-ditch efforts float wide of the post all too often, but Pogba absolutely nailed it. He's getting there.\nThe finish with his left foot was brilliant and the one he scored with his right was even better.\nChelsea had just conceded for the second time in this match against Stoke but on each occasion the Blues raised their game. The touch from Diego Costa that set up Willian to score his first goal was sensational, but the Brazilian still had much to do and did it with calculated precision.\nHowever, it was Fabregas who cut Stoke's throats with a glorious through ball for Willian, who smashed it past visiting goalkeeper Lee Grant.\nLiverpool boss Klopp and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola spent the week stroking each other's artichokes prior to their meeting at Anfield, but neither of them can hold a candle to Antonio Conte and what he is doing with Willian and company at the moment.\nWinning at Southampton was a very impressive performance by West Brom and in particular Matt Phillips, who is having an excellent season.\nHe took his goal brilliantly and from that moment there was no coming back for the Saints.\nIt's been a miserable holiday period for Southampton since their controversial defeat by Tottenham and they never really looked like they had recovered from that mauling in time for the match against the Baggies.\nWhat Tony Pulis has going at The Hawthorns is nothing short of miraculous. The purchase of Phillips has been inspired.\nDele Alli is officially 'in the mood'. Just like the old Glenn Miller classic, the player looks upbeat and gets you on your feet.\nFrom the moment he struck the bar with a cracking drive, I knew he was up for the Tottenham game at Watford.\nTo be fair, this performance against a poor Hornets side was a continuation of his display against Southampton.\nSpurs have been desperate for someone to share the goalscoring responsibilities with Harry Kane, and Alli has duly obliged. We've now got to get him playing for England the way he is playing for Spurs.\nHarry Kane is back to his best again and he hasn't been looking like that for a while.\nThe first signs of a more relaxed, but purposeful, Kane were against Southampton and he would have capped an excellent performance that night had the earth not moved beneath his feet as he was about to take a penalty.\nHis all-round display against Watford was fantastic, not to mention his two goals. I have had a real dilemma this weekend having seen Diego Costa play one of his best games for Chelsea, Kane playing like he's finally put the European Championship behind him and Andre Gray scoring his first hat-trick.\nI couldn't have had three more exciting candidates. Sadly, Costa has hit the cutting-room floor but somebody had to.\nIt is good to see Andre Gray playing football and scoring goals again.\nI was more than a little perturbed by the severity of the punishment imposed by the Football Association for his inappropriate Twitter remarks four years earlier. How sad that the governing body had no room for redemption.\nMuch has changed since those remarks and an extremely apologetic Gray seems far more mature than he was four years ago but, nevertheless, he took his medicine like a man.

But the referee was unequivocal as she pointed to the spot. Confusion then reigned.\nAfter White, Bronze and skipper Steph Houghton spoke to the referee and the Spanish fans prepared for a potential equaliser, the whole stadium was then left baffled as a free-kick was awarded to England.\nReferee Vitulano seemed to indicate she had not originally been aware the ball had deflected onto White's arm, rather than hitting it direct from the cross.\nCommentating for BBC Radio 5 live, Jonathan Pearce said: \"I don't think you can do that.

You have to be incredibly fit and get numbers around them. It only takes one person to switch off and you get punished. Inevitably, if you have Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets, who are great at keeping the ball, you will be physically tested - and you could see Manchester City were very tired at the end.\"\nCity, however, were able to contain Barcelona, apart from a dangerous long-range effort from Xavi that Hart turned away.\nThe muscular Negredo was posing problems for Barcelona with his physical presence, while keeper Victor Valdes had to come through a crowd to save after David Silva's free-kick sparked a scramble in the six-yard area.\nCity would have felt satisfied with that opening 45 minutes but they were undone nine minutes after the restart and left feeling a sense of injustice as Messi put Barcelona ahead from the spot.\nThey felt Sergio Busquets had fouled Jesus Navas, allowing Barcelona to develop a move that ended when Demichelis fouled Messi as he raced on to Iniesta's pass.\nSwedish official Jonas Eriksson pointed to the spot, even though City had a case that first contact was outside the area, then made matters worse by sending Demichelis off before Messi stroked in the penalty.\nBarcelona's share of the possession over the course of the first leg was 68.4%\nSource: Opta\nIt led to an instant reshuffle by Pellegrini, who sent on Joleon Lescott and Samir Nasri for Navas and Aleksandar Kolarov in a bid to ensure there was no further damage as a result of City's numerical disadvantage.\nBarca, though, were enjoying the sudden change in circumstances and Alves should have hit the target when he found space in the area, only to shoot wide of the far post from an angle.\nBoth sides made changes with 17 minutes left, Edin Dzeko coming on for Negredo while Brazil superstar Neymar, returning from injury, replaced Alexis Sanchez for Barcelona.\nCity were still battling and Valdes was forced into a sharp save from Silva's volley following fine approach work from Yaya Toure and Pablo Zabaleta.\nIf City could have restricted Barcelona to a one-goal lead they would have travelled to the Nou Camp on March 12 with some hope - but Alves has surely put the Catalans into the last eight.\nMatch ends, Manchester City 0, Barcelona 2.\nSecond Half ends, Manchester City 0, Barcelona 2.\nAttempt saved.

Talks will now begin on devolving more powers to Scotland.\nBBC political editor Nick Robinson\nThe people have spoken. Scotland has rejected independence. The result has been accepted by both sides. So that you might think is that. Not a bit of it.\nThe fact that over 1.5m British citizens voted not to remain part of the UK, the fact that a majority in Scotland's biggest city - Glasgow - backed independence, the fact that the Westminster establishment briefly thought this vote was lost, is the reason for that.\nThe leaders of the three UK parties are now promising significant constitutional change and not just for Scotland but for England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.\nThey have agreed on a timetable for giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament but are a long, long way from agreeing proposals.\nRead more from Nick Robinson.\nMr Salmond said he was \"immensely proud\" of his Yes campaign and serving as Scotland's First Minister had been \"the privilege of my life\", but he conceded that the SNP would benefit from new leadership to take the process on.\nThe party had \"the opportunity to hold Westminster's feet to the fire on the 'vow' that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland,\" he said. \"This places Scotland in a very strong position.\"\nBut while he would continue to serve as MSP for Aberdeenshire East, he had decided to stand down after the party's annual conference in November.\n\"We lost the referendum vote but can still carry the political initiative,\" he said. \"More importantly Scotland can still emerge as the real winner.\"\nIn a statement outside Downing Street Mr Cameron defended the decision to hold the referendum, saying it was right that the SNP's majority in Holyrood was respected.\nHe said Lord Smith of Kelvin had agreed to oversee the process of devolving more powers over tax, spending and welfare to Scotland, with draft legislation by the end of January.\nMr Cameron added that the rights of other people in the UK needed to be \"respected and enhanced\". He said he had long believed that a crucial missing part was England. He said \"the millions of voices of England must be heard\".\nThe Leader of the Commons William Hague has been asked to draw up plans for what would be a fundamental change at Westminster - that only English MPs could vote on English matters.\nBBC deputy political editor James Landale\nThe Downing Street constitutional declaration - as it will become known - marks the start of what potentially could be massive constitutional change.\nIn particular, the prime minister has promised to give English MPs a greater say over legislation that affects England. He made clear this would cover the same issues over which Scotland will have greater control - tax, spending and welfare. And the changes will be agreed at the same pace with draft legislation by January.\nBut David Cameron did not spell out the detail, leaving a policy vacuum that will now be filled by Conservative MPs and an army of constitutional experts and think tanks. Everything from a full English parliament to complicated plans for English grand committees will be discussed.\nThe risk for the PM is that he loses control of this debate.\nRead more from James Landale\nMr Hague insisted there was a \"very clear commitment\" to the Scottish reforms pledged by the three main UK parties, but he argued that the English question had to be resolved at the same pace.\n\"I think it would be inconceivable to go ahead with a further important stage and measure of devolution to parts of the United Kingdom, without addressing this issue,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Of course it's been an anomaly for quite a long time now that Scottish MPs can vote on everything happening in England, but we the English MPs can no longer do so in Scotland, and indeed nor can the Scottish.\n\"But it will become absolutely acute - it will become absolutely indefensible with further devolution - and I think people need to know at the time of the general election next May where we all stand on that, whether we've tried to reach an agreement, and if not, it's something they can decide on in the general election.\"\n'History made'\nBBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the proposal to restrict voting rights for Scottish MPs could undermine a future Labour government - theoretically there could be a Labour PM who lacks a majority of English MPs so is unable to get health or education issues through parliament.\nBut Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at his party's conference in Manchester, said he would not allow the moment \"to be used for narrow party political advantage\".\nInstead he announced plans for a full constitutional convention \"rooted in our nations and regions... to ensure decisions are taken closer to the families and businesses\".\n\"These issues can no longer be fixed solely by politicians or prime ministers trying to shore up their position in their own party,\" he said. \"The people need to be given a voice too.\"\nHe did not comment on proposals for English-only votes in Parliament, instead calling for more powers to be devolved to regions within England.\n'Rash promises'\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was time for the \"clammy grip\" of Westminster and Whitehall to be released \"so that communities, families, cities, towns and villages across the UK feel that they have more say over their destiny than is currently the case\".\nMayor of London Boris Johnson said the result was \"a great day for Britain\" and pressed the case for English devolution. \"What is sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who was sacked by Mr Cameron as environment secretary in July, demanded an immediate recall of Parliament to debate a new constitutional settlement.\nHe said it had been \"completely unacceptable that right at the end of the campaign we have an ex-Labour leader (Gordon Brown) galloping off up to Scotland making some very rash promises of extensive new powers to the Scottish people - apparently with the endorsement of all three UK party leaders.\"\nEngland's voice\nConservative Bernard Jenkin said he supported English votes for English laws, but claimed Mr Cameron's \"No\" campaign had been \"patronising, over bearing,\" and had given very little clarity about the implications of independence - \"just rather a lot of scare stories\".\nEx-Labour minister Frank Field urged the Labour leadership to come up with its own answer to the \"English question\" as soon as possible, warning that the party could not afford to drag its heels or be seen as \"anti-English\".\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was now time for a \"constitutional convention to find out how a fair UK would work\".\n\"I think England needs a voice,\" he said. \"We've heard a lot from Scotland.

He will miss Sunday's Premier League game at Middlesbrough.\nMourinho was then forced into another change, and a reshuffle at the back, when defender Blind went off midway through the half with suspected concussion.\nWith a congested fixture list caused by United battling for Europa League success and a place in the Premier League top four, Mourinho will hope neither player is out for an extended period.\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BT Sport: \"We were afraid of extra time. It was a difficult game.\n\"We have lots of enemies. Normally the enemies should be Rostov but we have a lot of enemies. It's difficult to play Monday with 10 men, it's difficult to play now, it's difficult to play 12 o'clock on Sunday. We have a lot of enemies.\n\"A lot of people might say we should have scored more goals. But a lot of things are going against us. The boys are amazing boys. We will probably lose the game on Sunday. Fatigue has a price.\n\"I will remember forever when I spoke to the Uefa delegate in Rostov. He told me if any of our players gets injured, the insurance paid. Whoever decided the Monday and Sunday games probably thinks the same way.\"\nUnited are next in action when they travel to Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Sunday (12:00 GMT).\nMatch ends, Manchester United 1, FC Rostov 0.\nSecond Half ends, Manchester United 1, FC Rostov 0.\nCorner,  FC Rostov.

She had an infectious laughter. She loved her family.\nEven with Alzheimer's, parts of her had not been lost. Her family still cannot believe she is gone.\n\"She was murdered. That's how we see it. Decisions were made by people who had no regard for my sister and any of the other families, in the end they killed them,\" says Christine Nxumalo.\nHer sister, 50-year-old Virginia Machpelah was one of the 94 psychiatric patients who died following a move from facilities run by Life Esidimeni, a private healthcare company last year to various care homes in Gauteng province, around Johannesburg.\nMany were transferred without the knowledge of their families.\nAbout 1,900 patients were transferred to these centres after the Gauteng Health Department cancelled its contract with the private institution in 2015 to save costs.\nChristine Nxumalo:\n\"She looked so thin - she wasn't the Virginia I knew. She was in good spirits, she didn't want us to leave - we spent hours laughing. She could even remember who we were.\"\nThe mass transfers were made between March and June last year, scores of deaths followed but they were not reported, not even to the families, according to an independent report.\nThe department was paying for the patients' upkeep - from medication to specialised therapies - because the families couldn't afford them.\nAnd the families were happy.\nSo what went wrong?\nIt emerged that the department, against all advice and two court cases to stop their plans, moved the chronic patients into community facilities, which didn't have the staff, facilities and proper equipment to care for them.\nThe report says that of the deceased, 77 died in 27 facilities which did not even have valid operating licences. Some of these centres were a little more than a house with a few hospital beds, if that.\nThis tragedy has shocked many in South Africa.\nThis is the first such case reported in the country - the challenge now for all those involved would be how to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\nSome have suggested better monitoring of care homes to make sure they are inspected before patients are sent there. They argue this could have saved many lives in this case.\nWhile the national Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has been praised for calling for the investigations, he says he is \"very angry and heartbroken\" over the deaths, especially because they could have been avoided.\nA damning report titled No gun: 94 silent deaths and still counting by Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba revealed that many of the patients had died from dehydration, starvation and diarrhoea.\nUncontrolled seizures and pneumonia were also listed in the report, suggesting that the patients were refused medication.  Only one death was directly attributed to mental illness.\nThe provincial health department had been adamant that the move was in line with the country's 2002 Mental Health Act to \"de-institutionalise\" the patients - move them from psychiatric facilities to home-based centres.\nSource: No gun : 94 silent deaths and still counting\nThe department also said that the move would save money, but this claim has been dismissed by the ombudsman's report - and so it remains unclear why the former provincial health minister Qedani Mahlangu approved the transfer.\nMs Mahlangu resigned just hours before the report into her department's handling of the matter was made public and has not spoken since.\nBut for Virginia's family, no explanation will ever suffice.\nMs Nxumalo says her sister appeared to have lost weight when she viewed her body in August, lying lifeless on a mortuary table.\nThe thought that she may have suffered before her death is too gruesome to bear.\n\"She looked so thin - she wasn't the Virginia I knew. When we last saw her before she was moved, she looked good,\" says Ms Nxumalo, tears streaming down her face.\n\"She was in good spirits, she didn't want us to leave - we spent hours laughing. She could even remember who we were.\"\nThe next news she heard of her sister was in a phone call in August telling her she had died - she wasn't only shocked to learn of her death but that she had been transferred without the family being told where she was.\n\"The woman we're talking about was a fighter,\" her sister tells me. \"She was the proud mother of a 20-year-old daughter who thought the world of her.\n\"She took great care of herself, didn't drink or smoke because she believed 'your body is the temple of God'.\"\nBut in the end, Virginia was stripped of all dignity - her body was one of a number dumped at an overcrowded morgue, unclaimed for weeks after her death because she had been taken there, once more without the family's prior knowledge or consent.\nShe died at Precious Angels, a centre in Attridgeville which recorded one of the highest deaths in one place in this unfolding scandal. It's in a township in the capital Pretoria.\nAccording to records, it was only registered in June last year as patients were being moved. It has since been shut although it's not clear when.\nThe two-floor brick house, which looks like any other suburban home on that street, is now home to some tenants.\n\"When we moved in late last year, some rooms hadn't been used for months, there were no patients but there were hospital beds outside,\" one tenant told me.\nChristine Nxumalo:\n\"Do you know how many lives could have been saved had the government listened? They cannot get away with this.\"\nThree other tenants are peering through the window at this point - they tell me they've been overwhelmed by families calling at the house, in search of answers.\nIn a terse phone call, the woman registered as the director of Precious Angels, Ethel Ncube, refused to comment on the matter, saying she was co-operating with the investigators.\nA total of 18 people died at her facility.\nWhen the story first made headlines, in September last year, the provincial health department put the death toll at 36 but this report suggests the deaths were already at 77 - a fact concealed by authorities.\nThe families' relatives say their loved ones were treated as \"less than human\" by people working for a government voted in to end inequality and discrimination - people who themselves knew oppression under white minority rule.\nNow new regional health minister Gwen Ramokgopa and a task team have been appointed to clean up the mess and help restore the public's faith in the care of South Africa's mentally ill patients.\nThey need to locate where all the patients are, inspect the conditions they are living in, investigate how many deaths remain unreported and work out how many patients are still alive.\nOpposition parties are calling for criminal charges to be laid against Ms Mahlangu and her officials over the deaths.\nIn the past, mental illness has been neglected in South Africa, resulting in inadequate budget and resource allocations.\nBut since 1994, the country's mental health laws have been brought into line with WHO standards but how the policy is carried out on the ground often falls short due to corruption, especially in public facilities, according to experts.\n\"We haven't learnt from previous mistakes in that the money did not go to the correct places, and did not provide adequate care for the most vulnerable in society,\" Daily Vox quotes University of Cape Town's head of Public and Community Mental Health, Professor Crick Lund as saying.\nThe families will meet with their legal representatives to decide how they can ensure the responsible are held to account and whether or how they want to proceed on issues of compensation.\nMs Nxumalo and other families are working with advocacy group Section 27 to bring those responsible to book.\n\"They were showed no mercy.

She rushed him to a hospital, where doctors washed his stomach and saved him.\nThree years later, in May 2012, Wagh's luck ran out.\nThe soybean crop on his two-acre farm had failed and he was drowning in a debt of 60,000 rupees ($890; \u00c2\u00a3631), borrowed from friends and relatives. Villagers found his lifeless body outside a local gas plant. He was 38.\n\"Some say he drank himself to death, others say he was electrocuted. His body had turned black. I was at my parents' place when this happened. My children said, if I had stayed at home, their father wouldn't have taken his life,\" says Mrs Wagh, 38.\nOver four years, Mrs Wagh has rebuilt her family - she has worked long hours, tilling the family plot and working on other people's farms; sent her son and daughter to polytechnic; bought livestock, repaid most of her husband's loan. Low interest loans from self-help groups have been a lifeline.\n\"I am lucky. Other widows are not so fortunate,\" she says, sitting in her tin-roofed home in Malegaon village.\nOne of them is Archana Burare, a 22-year-old widow, who now lives with her ageing parents and her baby boy in a village in Washim.\nWhen her husband took his life after consuming pesticide in 2014, her in-laws abandoned her and locked up their home, forcing her to return to her landless father and homemaker mother.\nMrs Burare was 19 when she got married. Her husband had taken a 12-acre farm on rent after borrowing 50,000 rupees, and begun growing rice, groundnut and soybean. The crop was good the first year, and she also worked at another farm, and things were going fine.\n\"Then the rains stopped and the land dried up. The well ran out of water and the crops failed.\"\nThe family went into a downward spiral. Her husband, she says, began drinking and beating her up. Then he broke his leg in a road accident, and could not afford an expensive private surgery to set it right. Meanwhile, the debts kept mounting: 25,000 rupees for her sister's marriage; another 20,000 rupees for the failing farm.\n\"I had gone to my parents' place for a break. He was alone at home when he drank pesticide and killed himself,\" says Mrs Burare.\n\"I did not get any compensation [from the government] because the land did not belong to my husband. My in-laws do not keep in touch.\"\nMrs Burare works as a cook at a government childcare centre for a salary of 850 rupees a month, but she hasn't been paid for the past eight months. Her widow pension is still stuck in the bureaucracy. She struggles to feed her extended family by working on other people's farms.\n\"I am trying to secure my family a bit, buying a few goats and a buffalo after taking some loans from self-help groups. My three-year-old son had an accident, and every check up at the private hospital is expensive. Government hospitals are crowded, it takes three days to get a scan.\"\nAccording to one estimate, more than 3,000 farmers in Maharashtra have taken their lives every year between 2004 and 2013. Last year, as many as 3,228 farmers took their lives, the highest in the last 14 years, a government minister informed the parliament recently. Widows of 1,818 victims were paid compensation of 100,000 rupees each; the rest were found to be ineligible.\nThe vast, rain-fed farms of Vidarbha region spread over 11 districts in Maharashtra are the worst affected.\nCash crops are expensive to grow and a global commodities downturn has meant a drop in demand and declining farm incomes. Access to formal credit is scanty, so farmers are forced to borrow at usurious rates from private lenders to buy seeds, fertilisers, water pumps, and pay for a marriage in the family. Two successive poor monsoons have led to some nine million farmers in the region facing near-drought conditions and crop failures.\nThat's not all. It is not easy for the widows to be eligible for compensation: tangled land deeds mean ownerships of plots are often disputed - there are some 80 cases related to property disputes after farm suicides in four districts - and payment is denied if alcohol is found in the viscera of a dead farmer. The paltry widow pension can take ages to process.\n\"The widows are the worst affected. Single women face discrimination in patriarchal village households anyway. If they are widowed, they are often thrown out, deprived of their land, and their children's future is jeopardised,\" says Kishore Tiwari, a prominent farm activist heading a government panel to curb suicides.\nMr Tiwari reckons 60% of some 10,000 farm widows in the Vidarbha region have received no compensation. What's keeping them going are dozens of non-profit and self-help groups networked to NGOs like Kisan Mitra (Farmer's Friend) which are counselling the widows, offering soft loans, making them aware of their property and legal rights and protecting them from sexual harassment.\nThe suicides mirror the state of India's ailing farms, which account for 14% of India's GDP, but on which more than half of its more than a billion people depend on for an uncertain living. Many farmers are simply not earning enough.\nAfter the soybean and cotton crop on his three-acre plot failed, Mandha Alone's husband, Sharad, borrowed money to buy an auto-rickshaw, while she worked on the parched farm in Wardha district.\nBut, in 2011, he was injured seriously in a road accident, and had to sell his wife's jewellery and some of his land and take a loan of 200,000 rupees for a series of surgeries. He began defaulting.\n\"That completely broke him. He drank heavily, beat me up. Then on the day of Holi (festival of colours) in 2013, he simply walked into a river near our village and drowned.\"\nMrs Alone says she went into a depression for a year. She was not eligible for compensation because the autopsy found liquor in Sharad's body. Then a self-help group arrived at her door and gave her a small loan to buy a sewing machine. Now she stitches clothes, works on other people's farms, and rents out the family plot.\nLife continues to be hard, and her husband's debts remain unpaid.\n\"I have told the bank and the debtors that I cannot pay anymore. I tell them, take the responsibility of my children and do what you want to do,\" says Mrs Alone.\n\"There's no future in farming anymore. In the villages, farmers are driving auto-rickshaws, working in brick kilns. Their daughters are sitting at home because they don't get good grooms.\n\"If you come here in 10 years time,\" says Ms Alone, \"you will see many, many more widows.\"", "summary": "He tried to take his life for the first time in 2009.", "id": "35714150", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

They are chasing teams above them now having established an 11-point cushion in fifth place.\nKane's late winner was dramatic, timely and on balance looked deserved as Saints were the better side overall. They took their chances whereas County did not.\nThe loss of Murray Davidson to an early thigh injury was catered for with the introduction of Keith Watson, and a couple of positional changes.\nThey coped with that setback well, as they did when County equalised, and some refereeing decisions did not go their way.\nAlston hit the post early on with a neat flick but Saints went ahead when the midfielder squared dangerously across the six-yard line.\nSteven MacLean pressured McEveley enough to force the defender to touch into his own net.\nLiam Craig cracked a post direct from a corner but the main source of frustration came when referee John Beaton somehow did not see Woods clearly handle Watson's header on the line.\nThey might also have had a penalty awarded when Richard Foster was caught on the edge of the box.\nMacLean was very unlucky with a superb touch and shot which was brilliantly saved by Scott Fox.\nThe great thing about this squad is they deliver consistently and did so again. As the clocked ticked, Kane took control and his winner, soaring into the top corner, was a thing of beauty.\nCounty's recent results at home have been damaging - this was their third straight defeat in Dingwall in all competitions, and the result adds pressure given the compact nature of the Premiership's bottom seven teams.\nNo significant damage was done in terms of league position but results like this might count further down the line.\nThere were key moments in this game that did not go their way.\nBefore St Johnstone's opener, Joe Shaughnessy appeared to handle in the box but whether that was intentional was unclear.\nIt is possibly more fruitful to consider things that can be directly controlled and Michael Gardyne blazed a fabulous chance miles over from inside which would have changed the complexion of the game.\nWhen Gardyne redirected a long diagonal off an upright, you started to wonder if it was just not their day.\nLiam Boyce was unlucky with a curling effort, as was Milan Lalkovic.\nTheir goal had a touch of fortune in that Woods' shot deflected straight to Curran, who delighted in curling home on his return to the starting line-up.\nTo lose the point so late in the game will be extremely frustrating, with a couple of testing fixtures to follow against Aberdeen and Hearts.\nRoss County manager Jim McIntyre: \"That's two weeks in a row we've lost a late goal and it's a real sickener given the effort we've put into the game.\n\"We got ourselves back into the game and didn't punish St Johnstone when we had the opportunity to.\n\"The most glaring opportunity was Gardyne's shot from eight yards which sailed over the bar. That was a big moment in the match.\n\"Nothing really changes. It's still very tight. Nothing is going to be decided over the next three or four games because you would class them as a harder run of fixtures.\n\"We've done it already this season at Ibrox and Tynecastle where we've put in really good performances and picked up points. There's nothing to say we won't go and do that again.\"\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"I thought we were excellent. I do think we deserved to win on the number of chances we created.\n\"We were good with the ball when in possession. We were excellent in terms of counter-attacking all day.\n\"We showed character again but it's a wonderful goal to win the game and it came at the right time.\n\"We knew if we beat them [Ross County] we'd go 13 [points] ahead of them and that's a big number to make up between now and when the split comes.\n\"We can't rest.

The NHS couldn't afford to lose 52,000 dedicated professionals and still deliver the service we need. They should think about these things before they shoot their mouths off in the way that they do.\"\nBut Mr Corbyn is facing growing calls from within his party to take a tougher line on immigration amid concerns that Labour voters who feel strongly about the issue are leaning towards voting Leave on 23 June.\nHow working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.\nMost of Labour's 229 MPs support staying in the EU. Former minister Frank Field, one of about 10 who back leaving, said Labour voters felt left behind by globalisation and alarmed by levels of immigration and would no longer be \"pushed around\" by an out-of-touch elite at the top of the party.\nHe warned that if Brexit-supporting Labour voters were made to feel \"unclean\" about their choice, there would be mass defections to UKIP and Labour's chances of winning the next election would be doomed.\n\"The idea that Labour voters are owned by the party... and the troops will do as they are told. That may have happened in 1945 but it has long ceased to happen and it isn't going to happen this time.\"\nFew people would pick a political fight with Tom Watson. Like Jeremy Corbyn, he has his own mandate from Labour Party members, who chose him to be the deputy, alongside the new leader.\nSo when he speaks, Labour listens.\nThat's why it was striking today that he chose to suggest that Labour needed not just to listen harder to their natural supporters on immigration, but to suggest that a future Labour government should pursue reforms to the rules that allow EU citizens from other countries to come and live in this country.\nHe knows that for many of the party's traditional supporters, the changes, or perhaps perceived changes, to their communities that the arrival of many particularly Eastern Europeans have brought have created worries and concerns - so much so that he said \"immigration has been the backdrop to every election we have had in Britain\" for the last decade.\nThat's quite some statement.\nRead more from Laura\nMr Watson said that while he supported the UK staying in Europe, the issue of uncontrolled migration was \"coming up on the doorstep\" and people need to be reassured that a Remain vote did not mean the end to reforms in Europe.\n\"For the last decade, I would say that immigration has been the backdrop to every election we've had in Britain,\" he said. \"And you know, woe betide politicians that don't listen to what voters tell them.\n\"You know, I think a future Europe will have to look at things like the free movement of labour rules.\"\nGreater controls on economic migration should be a priority for a future Labour government, he suggested.\nShadow home secretary Andy Burnham has said rules should be brought in immediately to protect skilled wages and discourage the use of agency staff from across Europe.\n\"It would work by setting clear rules that the going rates for work in the skilled sector cannot be undermined because what we get at the moment is people brought in at the minimum wage that undercut electricians or plasterers or whatever it might be,\" he said.\nVote Leave has been campaigning hard on immigration, saying the UK is powerless to control the numbers while it remains in the EU.\nConservative Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom told the Guardian her constituents complained to her that they did not hear English spoken when they walk down the high street.\n\"We absolutely fabulously integrate as a society but not if you overwhelm us,\" she said.\nEarlier on Tuesday, flanked by his shadow cabinet, Mr Corbyn warned that the future of the NHS could be threatened by a Leave vote while, in a co-ordinated attempt to bring Labour voters on side, union leaders also warned of public sector cuts.\nSpeaking the day after ex-leader Gordon Brown attempted to galvanise the party's supporters, Mr Corbyn said there would be a \"bonfire\" of workers' rights if there was a UK vote to leave the EU.\n\"We want to defend the very many gains made by trade unions across Europe that have brought us better working conditions - longer holidays, less discrimination and maternity and paternity leave,\" he said at the TUC's headquarters.\n\"We believe a leave vote will put many of those things seriously and immediately at risk.\n\"We also want to extend those rights and we best extend those rights by working with trade unions, labour parties and socialist parties all across Europe in the interest of the working people all across the continent.\"\nMeanwhile, leaders of some of the country's biggest trade unions, including the TUC's Frances O'Grady and Len McCluskey of Unite, have signed a letter saying they are worried leaving the EU will be \"a disaster for working people\".\nAnother letter, signed by 60 past heads of the UK's medical royal colleges and the British Medical Association, say the UK benefits from EU-wide action on infectious diseases and access to new medicines.\nAnalysis by political correspondent Iain Watson\nThe message from Jeremy Corbyn today was that Brexit would be bad for your health - arguing that many in the Leave campaign are no friends of the NHS.\nBut some in his shadow cabinet believe Labour has to talk more about the issue that's concerning many of their traditional voters: immigration. And those voters have to hear practical proposals.\nShadow home secretary Andy Burnham is calling for action to protect the living standards of skilled workers and prevent them from being undercut by migrants.\nAnother shadow cabinet member said he was picking up that some of the party's supporters were 'weak Leave' and could be brought round to Remain by a clearer and more consistent campaign on issues that concerned them.\nOthers said that voters simply needed reminding that the vast majority of Labour MPs back Remain.\nMr Burnham told me there is still time to win over the sceptics but his view isn't shared by all senior Labour politicians. As one senior figure close to the unions put it: 'People want change. If Brexit is the only change on offer, they'll take it.\"\nThe Remain campaign also received a boost when the chairman of retailer John Lewis said leaving the EU would have an \"adverse impact\" on consumer confidence.\nSir Charlie Mayfield told BBC Radio 4's The World at One the impact could be felt for as much as five years and he said it would probably lead to higher prices in the shops and could have an impact on jobs.\n\"As a businessman and looking at the economic issues, I do think that the economy will remain stronger if we remain in the European Union and that does matter,\" he

for England.\nContinuing to make a case for being the best right-back in the world, Bronze's class shone again in a performance that was typical of a Champions League semi-finalist. She will remain one of the first names on Sampson's teamsheet.\nEngland boss Mark Sampson: \"Austria's physicality and tactical nous caused us some problems in the first half but without ever threatening our goalkeeper.\n\"Our performance in the second half was excellent, from one to 11. There was really good balance to our game.\n\"We were hurt a little bit by our recent record. We felt hard-done by in terms of results.\n\"It was big to win. It was important. We needed that.

What more did the British fighter want?\nHe even seemed irritated that his new belt kept falling over. \"He's not used to those yet,\" said Hearn. On the evidence of Saturday's fight, he soon will be.\n\"I just don't want to make a big deal out of it,\" said the 26-year-old Londoner, having just won a world heavyweight title in only his 16th professional fight.\n\"I knew what I was here to do. I knew I wasn't losing. I spoke to someone on the phone the other day and said: 'Is it bad that I'm thinking about my post-fight speech already?'\n\"So what do you expect? When I retire on top I'll be happy.\"\nHistory suggests Joshua is adopting the right stance. When American legend Mike Tyson beat Trevor Berbick in 1986 to secure his first world heavyweight title, fame and adulation had already spoiled him. By Tyson's own admission, he was riddled with gonorrhoea that night. No wonder he looked so angry.\nJoshua disposed of Martin 63 seconds faster than Tyson disposed of Berbick. Joshua won a world title 12 fights faster than Tyson. Fingers crossed Joshua's career takes far longer to unravel - and that he's not spotted driving around with a tiger in his passenger seat any time soon.\n\"When was the last time in heavyweight boxing we had a role model young children want to be like?\" said Hearn. \"At Monday's public workout, he stayed for an hour and a half to sign autographs. He did another hour after the weigh-in and another hour after the fight. That's how he feels fans should be treated.\n\"If your son said, 'I want to be like Anthony Joshua', you'd be pleased with that. If he said, 'I want to be like Tyson Fury', what would you say?\"\nThe laughter from the press pack told Hearn everything he needed to know.\nBut Hearn isn't stupid. He wants Fury to carry on being naughtier than ever so that, when the time comes, he can promote the fight as good versus bad, sensible versus daft - however you want to frame it.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAnd anyway, Joshua isn't as nice as all that. For one, he's got a right hand that could fell an American fridge-freezer, never mind Charles Martin. And he knows full well that the British public wants a little bit more than a megawatt smile, some humble patter and the odd appearance on a panel show.\nWhen Hearn was informed of Fury's assessment of Joshua's latest victory - Manchester's WBA and WBO champion called his rival \"slow and ponderous\" - the promoter, as promoters do, sounded indignant. But Joshua - who has plenty of the street about him, don't worry about that - gently steamed.\n\"Why should I lower myself to Tyson Fury's level? He should act like a champion, but he acts like a kid. You see what an eight-pack and some muscles can do, knock out a champion in two rounds. Maybe he should take some tips.\n\"I'm here to knock people out. That's what people want to see. People come to see blood and I've got no problem drawing blood for people. I enjoy it.\"\nSuddenly, the heavyweight division, for so long so lukewarm, is beginning to bubble again: Joshua clattering through the ranks like a bowling ball through skittles; Fury with his ring cunning and air of malevolent mischief, affected or not; David Haye on the comeback trail; WBC champion Deontay Wilder, 'The Trap from Tuscaloosa' who can also hit a bit, holding up the American end.\n\"I'm not saying Fury or Haye are next, but they're certainly on the radar,\" said Hearn. \"We're not going to wait two or three years to fight them. The pressure will be on us [from the British public] after a voluntary defence or two.\n\"And it's about time we cracked the American market. The big money is in the UK nowadays but we'd like some more money from our friends in America. The plan is to turn AJ into a pay-per-view fighter over there. Showtime and HBO both texted me within two seconds of Joshua's fight, saying: 'Let's talk.'\"\nHearn also confirmed that the first battle between Joshua and Fury could take place at opposite ends of the country. Hearn said he had Wembley Stadium booked for Joshua's next fight on 9 July before Fury announced his rematch with Wladimir Klitschko would take place on the same date in Manchester.\nBoth men fighting different opponents on the same night seems like madness. But madness is Fury's stock in trade, while Hearn appears to revel in it.\n\"Sky turned down the Fury-Klitschko fight [which will be on subscription boxing channel BoxNation] because they didn't want to make a decision until Joshua had fought. They see AJ as the future,\" said Hearn.\n\"Sky are keen to go head to head with Fury-Klitschko. Fury did well beating Klitschko but it was an awful fight. When you see AJ fight, you get value for money.\"\nWho knows how that little bit of nonsense will be solved. Sky might see Joshua as the future, but fighting a relative unknown when Fury is fighting a legend on the same night seems foolhardy, however bad the first fight between Fury and Klitschko was.\nAnd with New Zealand prospect Joseph Parker fighting Carlos Takam in May, Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev fighting Britain's Dereck Chisora in the same month and Cuba's Luis Ortiz fighting Alexander Ustinov this summer, there aren't many decent names available.\nBut rest assured, Joshua is up for pretty much anyone. He'd fight King Kong, if only the British Boxing Board of Control would grant him a licence.\n\"Me, Fury, Haye, Wilder, we have to fight, it's bound to happen. We can't go through this whole era dodging each other. That would be silly.\"\nFar sillier things have happened in boxing, but Joshua at least sounds like he means it. And even if Joshua doesn't seem too excited about the ride ahead, you will be.\nA few years ago, I asked Nigel Benn whether he thought Chris Eubank Jr would struggle to bear the burden of his famous name.\n\"It's very worrying because he has a lot to live up to,\" said Benn, a former two-weight world champion who fought two classic matches against Chris Eubank Sr in the 1990s.\n\"Chris Sr was a great fighter, so he's going to have so much pressure on him.

Whether that clearance occurred on or behind the line was the contentious issue.\nMotherwell players surrounded referee Kevin Clancy as play resumed and it prompted a flurry of activity from the home backroom staff - including chief operating officer Alan Burrows - to try and obtain some footage to decide for themselves.\nThe photo Burrows retrieved suggested the ball was at least partly over the line, but left it hard to tell if it had completely crossed. With the sides only a point apart and battling the threat of relegation going into this contest, the incident certainly happened at a critical juncture of the season.\nThat controversial moment was in the middle of a first half which Motherwell edged, although Accies had a few decent chances through MacKinnon, D'Acol and Rakish Bingham.\nOne of the Steelmen's stars was the grafting Bowman, who has only scored one goal in 17 appearances for Motherwell so far, yet contributes in the forward areas in significant ways.\nBowman ran Hamilton ragged at times down the right, with Scott McMann not given enough help in his defensive duties on that flank as the hosts attacked.\nThe Englishman is tidy on the deck, can pick out a pass and possesses good physicality and heading ability in the air. The likes of Scott McDonald and Louis Moult may have grabbed more goals this campaign, but many of them come because of Bowman's hard work.\nIn saying that though, Bowman should have had one of his own in this match, screwing wide from five yards after McDonald's 10-yard shot was blocked.\nThe second half failed to live up to the first in terms of goalmouth action, with the ultimate stalemate the hosts' first clean sheet in 16 attempts.\nMotherwell's Elliott Frear watched his tasty half-volley drift wide and Massimo Donati stung the palms of Craig Samson for the visitors.\nThe next talking point turned out to be the confusing red card issued to MacKinnon, who was dismissed after a break in play while a Motherwell player received treatment.\nSpeculation in the ground suggested MacKinnon might have got involved in gesturing towards a home fan, which was subsequently spotted by the assistant referee.\nWhatever happened, Accies boss Martin Canning will surely be livid that one of his key players has failed to keep his cool at a period of the season he needs everyone to help stave off any threat of dropping down to the Championship.\nMotherwell manager Stephen Robinson: \"We're happy we've kept a clean sheet - we've become an organised side in the last few weeks. But we had enough chances to put the game out of reach for them.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"We had one potentially that was over the line. Unfortunately until the referees get some help it's an impossible task for them with the speed of the game. It's difficult to take when you know you should've won the game.\n\"It crossed the line but it wasn't given and we had to get on with it. In the second half we went too long.\n\"Ryan Bowman was our man of the match - he was outstanding and I'm sure the goals will come.\"\nHamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: \"When you come away from home in a derby and given we finished the last part of the game with 10 men, then I think it's a good point for us. Having won Saturday and got a point tonight, it keeps up the momentum.\n\"I thought it was a good game and you could see both teams were giving their all.\n\"Alex D'Acol was of the opinion he managed to get it off the line. It's difficult for linesmen and referees to make these calls but you hope over the season they even themselves out.\n\"Darian's said that he made a gesture so if that's the case then it's completely silly from a guy of his experience. He knows better than that. One thing Darian's done this season more than any other, is been really disciplined on the park. So he's let himself and the boys down because he'll miss two games.

Don't vex, as I hope to go through it all right, and if I do not you will know that I died for my wife and children and for my King and country.\"\nHis widow and their eldest son were presented with the medal in October that year by King George V. The medal is now held on display at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in Caernarfon.\nAged 23 in the summer of 1917, Sgt Ivor Rees from Felinfoel in Carmarthenshire, was already battle hardened when he arrived at the Ypres salient. He had been with the 38th Division at Mametz Wood during the First Battle of the Somme in 1916.\nHe was with the 11th Battalion, South Wales Borderers, part of the 115th Brigade, which was to form the reserve force in the push to Pilkem Ridge.\nBy 10:00 they had reached the Steenbeek river, but across the way at a gite the Germans had a reinforced blockhouse and two pillboxes pinning them down.\nHis citation reads: \"For most conspicuous bravery in attack. A hostile machine gun opened fire at close range, inflicting many casualties.\n\"Leading his platoon forward by short rushes, Sjt Rees gradually worked his way round the right flank to the rear of the gun position. When he was about twenty yards from the machine gun he rushed forward towards the team, shot one, and bayoneted another.\n\"He then bombed the large concrete emplacement, killing five and capturing thirty.\"\nHe was promoted to Company Sergeant Major in September, and survived the war to return home to civilian life in Wales, working for Llanelli Borough Council, dying in 1967, aged 73.\nA memorial stone to commemorate his bravery is being unveiled in Llanelli on 31 July.\nSgt Robert Bye was the first of only two VCs ever won by the Welsh Guards. The regiment was only formed in 1915, and the miner from Penrhiwceiber in the Cynon Valley joined in April of that year.\nOn the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele the Welsh Guards were part of the 3rd Guards Brigade attack on the left flank.\nThe force encountered heavy fire from a series of blockhouses hidden in wooded areas, and the 27-year-old slipped from shell hole to shell hole to outflank their positions.\nHe then put three bombs into the pillboxes to silence the guns. It is estimate he was responsible for the death or capture of 70 German soldiers.\nHis VC citation reads: \"For most conspicuous bravery. Sjt Bye displayed the utmost courage and devotion to duty during an attack on the enemy's position.\n\"Seeing that the leading waves were being troubled by two enemy blockhouses, he, on his own initiative, rushed at one of them and put the garrison out of action.\n\"He then rejoined his company and went forward to the assault of the second objective. When the troops had gone forward to the attack on the third objective, a party was detailed to clear up a line of blockhouses which had been passed.\n\"Sjt Bye volunteered to take charge of this party, accomplished his object, and took many prisoners. He subsequently advanced to the third objective, capturing a number of prisoners, thus rendering invaluable assistance to the assaulting companies.\n\"He displayed throughout the most remarkable initiative.\"\nThe soldier survived the war, and later became a Sergeant Major in the Sherwood Foresters, serving in World War Two.

We never really got out, we never really got a hold of the ball, so it was really hard work.\n\"A point here is a great point regardless of the circumstances because we've lost here regularly and St Johnstone put you under pressure and work every so hard.\n\"They have a good way about them and Steven MacLean leads the line brilliantly for them.\n\"Craig Samson made a few good saves for us.

This is where the danger lies.\nAs China tries to extend its control over the water of the sea (as opposed to the islands), it is challenging both the other countries in the region and the international system.\nUnder current international law - laid down in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - a country can only own a piece of sea if it owns the land next to it.\nA country that owns an island also \"owns\" 12 nautical miles of seabed around the island and has the rights to the resources (but not the territory) up to 200 nautical miles around.\nHowever, the Chinese government and its state-owned enterprises (particularly oil companies and fishing enterprises) are trying to assert ownership of the South China Sea itself, plus its seabed and its resources, many hundreds of miles away from the Chinese coast.\nThis is a challenge to the other countries around the sea with claims of their own, to the US whose role as a global military and commercial power depends upon unimpeded access through the world's seas and to every other country that believes in the current rules of international law.\nThey say (broadly) that the sea more than 12 nautical miles away from a coast doesn't belong to anyone and is therefore free for anyone to use in any way they see fit. (It's more complicated than that but that's the basic principle.)\nJapan needs one oil or gas tanker to cross the South China Sea every six hours to keep its economy functioning; South Korea is similarly dependent on energy imports.\nBoth countries have other concerns about the way that China is rising too.\nJapan has its own dispute with China over the Senkaku/Daioyu islands, sees common cause with Vietnam and the Philippines and has begun supplying both with coastguard ships and other equipment and training to help them defend their maritime claims.\nSouth Korea is less vocal, but also concerned and also supplying weaponry to the Philippines and Indonesia.\nIndia does not depend upon the South China Sea so much, but it fears the consequences if China comes to dominate Asia.\nIt has two disputes with China over border areas in the Himalayan Mountains.\nIt is also nervous about China's growing relations with countries around the Indian Ocean and has been developing security ties with Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan and Australia (among others) in response.\nThe Chinese authorities say they have been the historic \"owners\" of the sea \"since ancient times\".\nThe Chinese government's interest in the sea actually only began in the early 20th Century.\nFor all but the briefest periods of recorded history (one exception is a 30-year period from 1400-1430, during which time the so-called eunuch admirals, including Zheng He, voyaged as far as East Africa) the Chinese authorities were barely able to control their own coastline, let alone islands hundreds of miles away.\nZheng He: The Eunuch Admiral\nZheng He was born in the poor province of Yunnan in 1372 into a Muslim family from Central Asia who had fought for the Mongols.\nCaptured by the armies of the Ming dynasty, he was castrated at the age of 10.\nHe was sent to serve the emperor's son, and so distinguished himself in battle that he rose to the rank of admiral.\nHis armada, bigger than the combined fleets of Europe, featured giant treasure ships 400ft (122m) long and 160ft (50m) wide.\nHe sailed throughout South East Asia and the Indian Ocean, and on to the Persian Gulf and Africa, creating new navigational maps, and spreading Chinese culture.\nHe opened up trade routes that are still flourishing today, and gained strategic control over countries that are now once again looking to China as undisputed regional leader.\nThis version of history is not the one taught in Chinese schools.\nThis strongly held, but historically unjustified sense of ownership is what is putting China on collision course with its neighbours and the US.\nIt is the reason why China behaves with such high-handedness when sending oil rigs to drill in disputed waters, for example.\nTo protect themselves against China's encroachments, other countries are forming new security relationships.\nThese overlapping interests have the potential to turn a local dispute into a regional or even a global one.\nAt a time of so many international crises, the South China Sea disputes appear relatively small - but they could get big very quickly.\nChanging this behaviour will require the countries of the region to come to a better understanding of the shared history of the South China Sea.\nThat will be hard but it will be easier than the alternative of escalating conflict and the increasing risk of superpower confrontation.\nBill Hayton is the author of The South China Sea: The struggle for power in Asia, just published by Yale University Press.", "summary": "South East Asia says it's \"seriously concerned\" about China's building of artificial islands in disputed parts of the South China Sea.", "id": "29560533", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

It may subside during the winter months but it will return in the spring. The world knows that Germany has taken in over a million refugees. Its generosity will be tested further.\nAngela Merkel's political future is bound up in the numbers of migrants that will arrive in 2016.\nShe may have won a standing ovation from her party at its annual conference in December but across Germany the doubts are growing.\nThe first test will come in state elections in the spring. If the conservative CDU polls badly then the questions will resurface about whether Angela Merkel can stand again in 2017.\nThere is no obvious successor but the test for the chancellor is a simple one. Is she right to insist that a limit cannot be imposed on the numbers arriving or will it put the social fabric under increasing strain?\nHer future - and to a certain extent that of the European project - has been placed in the hands of President Erdogan of Turkey.\nIn 2016 he will decide whether Turkey's borders should be vigorously patrolled to limit the numbers crossing into Europe.\nThe Turkish president has been given every incentive to do so, including the offer of visa-free travel in Europe, but it remains uncertain what Turkey will do. The first indication will come when the weather improves.\nThe year will also test Europe's determination to live up to its values. Will it stand up for press freedom in Turkey, or will necessity silence its voice?\nThe migrant crisis will also determine the future of the passport-free Schengen area. In the short term I expect more border controls and fences until Europe finds a way to process the new arrivals and limit their numbers.\nEurope's leaders have said repeatedly that it will be impossible to defend its passport-free area unless its external borders are secure.\nGreece and Italy have been overwhelmed by the numbers of migrants. Many do not even register at the place they arrive in Europe but just head towards Germany or Sweden.\nIn 2016 Europe seems determined to deploy guards to its external borders, even if that is against the wishes of the member state concerned.\nThere will be a battle over this but I expect a version of the plan to survive.\nWhy? Because the survival of Schengen will be framed as a battle to defend the European project.\nEuropean border guards will be another giant leap forward for European integration and will once again prove Jean Monnet right when he said that Europe would be built on its crises.\nFurther attacks - like the ones in Paris - will deepen the debate about open borders.\nThe European establishment will be nervous about the UK referendum on its future in Europe.\nThe expectation is that David Cameron will hold an in-out referendum in the summer of 2016.\nThe view in Brussels is that a deal will be done in February enabling the prime minister to claim Britain's relationship with the EU has changed.\nThe polls suggest a tight campaign that will severely test the unity of the Conservative party.\nIf the polls predict a very close outcome then some of the banks expect there will be an impact on sterling, on the equity markets and on the inflows of capital that Britain depends on - running a current account deficit.\nIn the end the campaign will come down to an argument over what life would be like outside the EU: reclaiming sovereignty and less regulation versus the uncertainty of what would happen to Britain's trading relationships, its economic security.\nSeveral UK ministers believe that the vote will be decided by the issue of migration - a further indication of just how fundamental the migrant crisis is for the future of Europe.\nThe European economy has shown surprising resilience. The recovery has taken root but growth remains fragile. It is a recovery that remains vulnerable to shocks.\nGermany - so reliant on its exports - survived the slowdown in emerging markets. This will be tested again in 2016 with the expected slackening in world growth.\nAttention in Europe will fall on the French economy. Unemployment has edged up again. The year ahead will be dominated by the approaching presidential elections in 2017.\nFor the rest of Europe the key question is whether the Front National of Marine le Pen will be able to push beyond her current levels of support and become a real contender in 2017?\nGreece has been taken off the critical list but expect the Greek crisis to flicker back to life in the year ahead.\nThe radical left government in Athens is hoping that in 2016 debt relief will be on the agenda. Probably the most it can expect is that the terms of its debt repayments will be loosened.\nThe challenge for Greece and its creditors is that, at some stage, they will have to demonstrate where growth will come from and how unemployment will be reduced in order to sell pension reform and other tough measures.\n2016 will see further slippage on countries meeting their deficit reduction targets.\nSpain was set to miss its 2015 deficit target of 4.2% (it will stand at 4.7%) even before the recent election - which will usher in a period of political uncertainty. France will likely miss its deficit target through 2017.\nWith anti-austerity parties having done well in Spain and Portugal there will be fresh pressure on Brussels to police the deficit targets.\nThe big question for Europe's policymakers is whether it can escape so-called \"secular stagnation\" - a condition of negligible growth.\nIn 2016 watch sentiment incline further towards launching major investment projects.\nIn foreign affairs Europe will once again struggle to have an influential voice. Even though events in Syria are having a huge impact in Europe, Brussels is not a main player.\nIt will have a seat at the table at the expected Syrian peace conference but it won't have a card like the Russian president has dealt himself. Certainly members of the European Parliament will push for Europe to develop a convincing foreign policy.\nAfter Syria, it is Libya that will preoccupy Europe's leaders. It is the most dangerous crisis.\nSooner or later Europe will have to address the question of whether they are prepared to allow the so-called Islamic State (IS) to have a base on the Mediterranean in Libya.\nThe current plan is to try to unite the various Libyan factions in the hope they can drive out IS.\nIf a terrorist attack in Europe was found to have its origins in Libya then the Italian government and its allies would come under huge pressure to respond.\n2016 is likely to see Libya move up the international agenda.\nOver Ukraine, Europe will struggle to maintain the sanctions against Russia.\n2016 will see a further clash of ideas: a struggle between nationalists and globalists; a struggle between those who want to revive the power of the nation states and those who believe the answers lie in international bodies like the EU; a struggle between those who believe they are defending Europe's Judeo-Christian traditions (like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban) and those wedded to multiculturalism (Angela Merkel).\n2015 began with the attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. It was seen as an attack on freedom of speech and drew thousands on to the streets.\nBut the argument has not been resolved.\nThe clash is about the right to offend.

This was a vain hope.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nUnited's elimination came after a valiant showing against Wolfsburg but a colourless performance in the home game against PSV Eindhoven left them with a hurdle that was too high to negotiate.\nThat poor show was more representative of United than any of the small positives that can be taken away from their final, decisive game.\nThis was not a testing group for a team of United's financial and footballing stature - and Van Gaal cannot realistically be taken seriously if he tells any hard luck stories.\nUnited were as good in attack as they have been throughout the group stages in Germany but they defended abysmally and ultimately did not deserve to reach the knockout phase.\nAnd, with growing discontent among United's support about Van Gaal's pragmatic style, the prospect of preparing for Europa League action on Thursday nights will not improve his standing.\nThere is no suggestion that even a failure of this significance will put Van Gaal's position in jeopardy, but to have spent in excess of \u00a3250m and slipped out so tamely is bound to raise questions about how comfortable a fit he is for the demands of Old Trafford.\nIt is fully expected Van Gaal will see out the final 18 months of his contract but football is a fluid game and he will need big results between now and the end of the season to stem rising unhappiness about United's style of play.\nIn Van Gaal's defence, it should be pointed out that United have suffered a dreadful run of injuries, from the moment in-form Luke Shaw broke his leg in the opening group defeat against PSV. Wayne Rooney was also missing in Germany, along with defenders Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo as well as midfield man Ander Herrera.\nIt was still startling, however, to see Michael Carrick's experience ignored until he came on for the labouring Bastian Schweinsteiger and the almost missing-in-action and forgotten Nick Powell replacing Juan Mata when goals were needed.\nVan Gaal has perhaps not been given the credit he deserves for stabilising United and restoring them to the top four last season but, given the continued outlay, the veteran coach needs to improve on that and give the club a return on their vast investment.\nThe Dutchman, unlike Moyes before him, sounds full of conviction with every statement he makes. The big problem he has is his team are utterly unconvincing.\nBarring the steepest of declines, the full intention of Old Trafford's power brokers is to keep Van Gaal until the end of his contract in 2017. Results like Tuesday's, however, may well mean they will train their eyes even more keenly on who will succeed him.\nIt would stretch credibility to breaking point to believe United's top brass have not given some thought to who will be the next man in the manager's office at Carrington.\nFormer AC Milan, Paris St-Germain, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti is out of work and has admitted he would like to work in the Premier League again.  The name of Pep Guardiola will entice any Premier League club as he considers his future at Bayern Munich.\nThe solutions may yet be found closer to home and those graduates from Ferguson and youth coach Eric Harrison's famous 'Class of 92'.\nRyan Giggs is the quietest second fiddle around - a seemingly silent partner to the single-minded, almost dictatorial Van Gaal, but events elsewhere in the past few days have perhaps shifted emphasis significantly.\nWhile Giggs is regarded as having made progress by some within the club in his assistant's role - although it is hard to see how he can endorse the current playing style given his Old Trafford upbringing - there is no doubt those inside the club will be keeping a close eye on how Gary Neville develops having taken over at Valencia, with his brother Phil on his backroom staff.\nAnother member of that famous group, Paul Scholes, has emerged as one of the fiercest critics of the Van Gaal regime - so it is perhaps Neville's ascent that has given this narrative its most interesting twist.\nAs with Giggs, Neville knows United, knows the Premier League and the club would still be an attraction for any manager of ambition and quality.\nSo while there is no heat on Van Gaal, that is unlikely to stop those in control at United thinking of the framework for the future.\nThe first priority is to get back to winning ways at Bournemouth this weekend in the Premier League - then devise his strategy for the rest of the season.\nWhile the immediate prospect of the Europa League is not appetising, with former United defender Rio Ferdinand describing the notion of those Thursday night games as \"embarrassing\", it may yet form a crucial part of United's season.\nVan Gaal must weigh up the possibility of not taking it seriously, knowing Premier League rivals such as Liverpool and Tottenham have already proved they will, against its possible impact on league form.\nWill involvement help or hinder United's Premier League campaign? It is currently an imponderable and a trophy in the cabinet is still enough to warm the hearts of most disgruntled fans.\nIt is a tough balancing act, particularly as Van Gaal is wrestling with that injury list - Chris Smalling the latest casualty as he limped through those closing minutes in Wolfsburg.\nUnited are only three points off the Premier League summit, so have the chance of being genuine challengers in an unpredictable season, but Van Gaal must find the way to balance his team between attack and defence.\nThey have the best defensive record in the league, conceding only 10, but have scored only 20 - 12 fewer than leaders Leicester City.\nIn 53 league games Van Gaal has overseen seven 0-0 draws - at a percentage of 13.21% that is over twice that of Ferguson (5.56%) and Moyes (5.88%).\nThis was one of many puzzles Van Gaal had to solve as the devastated and dispirited United party flew out of Germany and into the perceived oblivion of the Europa League.\nUnited supporters like to sing about their standing as \"The pride of all Europe\" - the truth of the matter is they were not even that in the latter days of Ferguson's regime and this exit simply underlines their reduced status.\nUnited last won the Champions League against Chelsea in 2008, but further final appearances against Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 ended with Ferguson's side utterly outclassed on both occasions. They did not even made it out of the group stage in 2011-2012.\nSince those days, Europe's elite such as Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and now even Paris St-Germain have got away from United.\nThe European decline has been setting in for years, so perhaps this campaign was simply another reality check.\nUnited's name does not strike fear into Europe's top teams these days and, on the evidence of this doomed group stage, will not daunt the bigger names in the Europa League either.\nThe feeling inside Old Trafford is that, in terms of priority, the Premier League makes up 80% of their season and Europe the remaining 20%.

Yes, they were two pieces of fine goalkeeping but Sterling should have made at least one of those opportunities count.\nPogba was football's most wanted in the summer. The 22-year-old was courted by all of Europe's top clubs, including Manchester City, but a \u00a370m price tag plus the player's own demands made the deal too rich even for them.\nThe Frenchman made fleeting contributions here but, make no mistake, the player that Sir Alex Ferguson somehow allowed to escape from Manchester United's grasp in 2012 is a class act.\nTall, rangy and more more than willing to mix it in the physical challenges with Yaya Toure, Pogba has that touch of class that marks him out as a special talent.\nHe always looks for the positive pass, as he proved with the glorious ball in behind Mangala that allowed Mandzukic to equalise for Juventus.\nJuventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised the contribution of 37-year-old goalkeeper Buffon, with the Italian World Cup winner making particularly good stops from Sterling.\n\"Buffon pulled off many miraculous saves, particularly just after we went 1-0 down,\" said Allegri.\n\"I hope he will go on for as long as possible, certainly as long as I am manager. Buffon is an extraordinary goalkeeper, perhaps the best ever in the history of football.

The island's economy is dependent on British grants and remittances from abroad.\nIt is linked to the outside world by a Royal Mail Ship, the St Helena, which makes a five-day journey from Cape Town in South Africa, every three weeks, carrying passengers and supplies,\nThe British government hopes an international airport completed in 2016 will boost the island's self-sufficiency, \"with the ultimate aim of eliminating the island's reliance on aid\".\nPopulation 4,255\nArea 122 sq km (47 sq miles)\nMajor language English\nMajor religion Christianity\nCurrency St Helena Pound (equal to British pound)\nEconomy Agriculture, fishing concessions and tourism\nHead of state: Elizabeth II, represented by a governor\nThe territory elects an assembly of 12 members, five of who sit on a local government council, chaired by the governor.\nThe governor is represented on Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha by local administrators.\nKey dates in St Helena's history:\n1502 - The island is uninhabited when it is first discovered by Portuguese mariners.\n1600s - The British East India Company uses the island as a way station for trading ships sailing home from the Orient and is granted a charter to run the island, installing its own governor in 1659.\n1815 - Napoleon Bonaparte is imprisoned on the island after his defeat at Waterloo and remains confined there until his death in 1821.\n1834 - St Helena becomes a British crown colony.\n1980s - Widespread poverty eases with the Falklands War creating job opportunities in both the Falklands and Ascension.\n2002 - Britain repeals a 1981 law depriving Saints of full citizenship, prompting a third of its inhabitants to leave the island to live or work elsewhere.\n2011 - The UK government announces plans to invest \u00c2\u00a3250m in the building of an airport on the island's east coast with a view to boosting the island's self-sufficiency.\nAscension Island\nJust south of the equator, Ascension Island is 700 miles from its nearest neighbour St Helena. It is a vital staging post for Britain in the South Atlantic and served as a key logistical base for troops during the Falklands War in 1982.\nThe island was an important communications and operations centre during both World Wars and its Wideawake airfield is now shared by the British and American air forces.\nToday, the island is used by the telecommunications company Cable & Wireless for satellite communications; Merlin, which runs a satellite-tracking station for the European Space Agency; the BBC World Service, which has a relay station there and the Composite Signals Organisation, which is part of GCHQ.\nThe island has a transient population of about 1,000, mainly Britons, Americans and St Helenians involved in the military, telecommunications and satellite tracking. It can be reached by air or by the RMS St Helena.\nBritain has expressed the intention of applying to the UN to extend its territorial rights around Ascension Island on the grounds that the island's landmass actually reaches much further underwater.

But the confidence with which his side played will give him encouragement - they held 58% of possession - ahead their next game at Anfield.\nMore threat in the final third may be a desire, but the introduction of summer signing Max Gradel from the bench shows options are available.\nTim Sherwood gave debuts to six summer signings as he embarks on his first full campaign in charge of a team.\nPerhaps his half-time words were behind the improvement as his side re-emerged quicker into the tackle and more threatening - notably when debutant Idrissa Gueye drew a fine save from Artur Boruc.\nSherwood has sought a presence up front to replace the 42 goals Christian Benteke contributed in his 89 league games, and in 6ft 4in Gestede, he has a player who contributed defensively from set pieces late on having already delivered the game's telling moment.\nThis was far from a free-flowing, transformed Villa, but they stuck to their task doggedly and maybe things are turning as a goal from a substitute was a luxury which did not arrive once last season but took just 72 minutes in this campaign.\nVilla must improve on consecutive finishes of 16th, 15th, 15th and 17th if Sherwood is to back up his early promise as a manager but in making decisions at key times, he showed terrific instincts on the opening day.\nWith half a dozen players new to the league - including the disappointing Jordan Ayew - it was perhaps understandable Villa felt their way into the fixture.\nHowe's side were threatening from the right flank in the opening period but as Gueye and left-back Jordan Amavi grew into the game, Villa's left-side stiffened up.\nThey were the most prominent away players on show, with Gueye's 74 touches only bettered by Amavi on 76 as the French full-back tackled ferociously and positioned himself well to ensure Villa won the battle down that key flank.\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I felt we dominated, especially possession and chances in the first half. If you're not clinical enough in their box and a player like Gestede comes on, you're in trouble. The chances will come at a premium this year and we need to take them.\n\"It was a great day for the football club regardless of the result. It's just a shame we couldn't back it up with the result, but I thought the performance was there.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood: \"I thought we were slow in the first period but we set out to nullify them and try to quieten this carnival atmosphere.\n\"Rudy hasn't trained an awful lot, but we knew he would give us a different dimension. We worked very hard to bring him to this football club so we're delighted - and that's a victory for the people behind the scenes at the club.\"\nBrought in at a reported \u00a37.7m from Nice, Jordan Amavi should answer plenty of questions at left-back where Villa have tried out the likes of Alan Hutton and Aly Cissokho in recent times.\nAt just 21, the France Under-21s international looked comfortable in the English game and prioritised his defensive duties over surging forward, winning 10 of his 15 duels.\nMatch ends, Bournemouth 0, Aston Villa 1.\nSecond Half ends, Bournemouth 0, Aston Villa 1.\nCorner,  Bournemouth.

More than a decade later, 13 councils still pay less than that amount.\nThe average maximum grant offered by councils is now \u00a363.80, still well short of the \u00a370 minimum recommended in 2009.\nThe lowest maximum grant levels were in North Ayrshire (\u00a340), Moray (\u00a345), and the Scottish Borders (\u00a345).\nWhile some councils paid almost double the amount offered by the lowest, such as West Lothian (\u00a3110), Dundee (\u00a3100), East Ayrshire (\u00a3100), West Dunbartonshire (\u00a3100) Highland (\u00a390) and Inverclyde (\u00a390).\nAngus Council had the lowest rate in 2015, having reduced it to just \u00a320. It has since raised the grant to \u00a350, the same as it was in 2005.\nMother-of-three Jackie says she has not yet received her grant from Glasgow City Council and is worried about not being able to afford new clothes before her children go back to school next week.\nShe says her partner works in a low-paid job and she is out of work so the council's grant to buy school clothing is important to her.\n\"I really need the uniform grant and I haven't received it this year because of an admin mistake because they're changing the system,\" she says.\n\"So it's becoming really stressful for me. I'm having to run out on very little money and try to buy last-minute things and use things from last year on the first week.\"\nJackie says: \"It's important how your kids look when they go into school. People who are struggling don't want to look like they're struggling.\n\"For the first week, I feel as though I'm going to be sending my kids in rags, basically.\"\nJackie says she can't see why the grant is not a standard amount wherever you are in the country and she thinks it should be higher than the \u00a352 Glasgow offers.\nShe says: \"The bar should be set a lot higher - it should be more than \u00a3100 at least - definitely.\n\"Things just cost too much - for a badged polo shift dress it can be as much as \u00a312 to \u00a315, the last time I looked at the prices  - and that's just for one. Realistically you would need five each.\"\n\"I have to try to hide my stress from the kids. I don't want them to pick up on it. I want them to go in feeling like they have a brand new uniform.\n\"I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get their hair cut by the time they go back. I'm just going to have to gel it for the first week and hope that it looks respectable enough.\n\"It's very stressful and it's very upsetting at times.\"\nAfter pressure from anti-poverty campaigners at the start of the last school year, Mr Swinney, the deputy first minister, promised to meet Cosla to discuss the school clothing grant and agree eligibility criteria and a minimum grant level.\nHe said this would ensure those families across Scotland who need support receive it.\nThat meeting did not take place.\nMr Swinney has now told BBC Scotland: \"The Scottish government took steps in legislation to establish the power to set a minimum rate - but we judged the most appropriate way to take that forward was by dialogue with local authorities to avoid regulation in this respect.\"\nHe said: \"The government would prefer to take forward a voluntary approach with local government but we have the power within legislation to establish that minimum level if we choose to do so.\"\nMr Swinney added: \"The evidence that has been looked at suggests that the minimum level for the clothing grant should probably be set about \u00a370. And a lot of local authorities are paying either at that level or in excess of that level.\n\"There will be a range of different perspectives around the levels for a minimum grant in this respect. I fully recognise the significance of the cost of children going to school and being properly equipped for school.\"\nA statement for local government body Cosla said: \"Scotland's Councils are committed to doing the very best for the communities they are elected to represent - especially those people in the most need.\n\"However, years of UK government austerity and a lack of investment in public services takes its toll.\n\"This coupled with year on year cuts to council budgets from the Scottish government has meant that councils have had to make extremely difficult decisions across all areas of their expenditure.\"\nJulie Hepburn runs the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Care School Uniform Bank, which provides school uniform free of charge to families in need, through a system of referrals.\nThe clothing consists of new and second-hand items.\nShe says there is growing demand across the country for services such as this.\n\"I've spoken to volunteers running the school banks around the country and we're all seeing a huge surge in demand this year,\" Ms Hepburn says.\n\"Partly people will be more aware of us and the service we offer but the demand is growing all the time.\n\"A number of the uniform banks are struggling to meet demand.\"\nMs Hepburn says she is always moved by the appreciation people show when she delivers a uniform package.\n\"Personally I find it very very difficult when we do drop off donations,\" she says.\n\"Sometimes people have been so stressed and worrying how they're going to get this uniform, when it does arrive they're quite emotional about it as well.\"\nAccording to Ms Hepburn, the school clothing grant, even for those who are eligible, does not cover all the items they need.\nShe says: \"If you are trying to kit out a teenager and you're trying to get shoes and a coat and a bag and a blazer - blazers are now compulsory in a lot of secondary schools.\n\"We were trying to get one this week that was \u00a345. If you're only getting 70-odd quid that is not enough to cover the uniform your child needs.\"", "summary": "The amount low-income parents can claim in school clothing grants still varies hugely around Scotland, a BBC Scotland investigation has found.", "id": "40889900", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "The Scottish government has the power to set a minimum rate but has chosen not to.

We've got to start seeing ourselves as the creators of health - individually and collectively - and not just passive recipients of whatever the professionals want to give us.\n\"We don't take health as seriously as disease. We focus too much on the operations on the hearts and limbs and eyes for diabetics many years down the road, or gastric banding for the overweight. We've got to start preventing those patients needing those interventions in the first place.\n\"I run what you might call a one-stop shop. So we've not only got conventional GP and community services, but also complementary services, a cafe, pharmacy and voluntary sector services.\n\"We concentrate on health in every sense, caring for patients when they need it, but enabling them to look after themselves and live better and happier lives whenever we can.  I'd like to reinvent the GP practice as a club where - with minor or self-limiting illnesses - we help each other to help ourselves, rather than use professional resources unnecessarily.\n\"No one expects their next door neighbour to be looking after their cancer or heart disease, but if we continue to spend as much NHS money as we do at present on things which could have been prevented, or don't actually need high tech input, then we will make the health service bankrupt and we won't have one tomorrow.\"\nGP Dr Charles Alessi  is co-chairman of the National Association Of Primary Care, and a senior adviser to Public Health England.\n\"The current healthcare system is on the verge of a revolution that will make our current ways seem as quaint as the horse and cart.\n\"More and more patients are taking control of their health. Patients regularly come to my surgery with a sheaf of internet printouts revealing their diagnosis and their suggestions for treatment.\n\"We can utilise this willingness to create a better healthcare system for us all.\n\"Other forms of digital technology can also empower patients. For people who have a single long- term condition like diabetes, there are already smartphone apps which advise how to alter your insulin dosage, or even change your medication.\nThe final part of Healthy Visions will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Friday 3 April at 13:45 BST. You can listen to the rest of the series now on the Radio 4 website\nListen to the 2014 Reith Lectures on the Future of Medicine\n\"In my vision, patients will carry their own medical records from practitioner to practitioner, demanding that care is carried out in convenient places such as pharmacies and supermarkets. Procedures like chemotherapy and dialysis will be delivered in the community or at home - not at a huge building we call a hospital.\n\"This may sound somewhat scary: next it'll be robots diagnosing and treating our illnesses. But the use of technology is to empower. It isn't to replace the doctor. It doesn't mean that face-to-face human interaction forged over the long-term is threatened. It is just different and more tailored to the individual.\n\"None of this will happen effortlessly. The change in the doctor - from the person in charge to an advocate and mentor through life-long illnesses - will not be easy. No doubt there will be resistance in places, and we will make some mistakes.\n\"But the days of the patient being subordinate to a great monolithic system are coming to an end.\"\nDame Carol Black is a former president of the Royal College of Physicians, and led two independent reviews for government about health in the workplace.\n\"We often think of the workplace as just where we go to do our job. But the workplace is more than that. It has the potential to be a place where you can improve your health. It can be a place to promote health - both physical and mental - and a place where you can improve well-being.\n\"There are good business cases now showing that investing in the health and well-being of staff is really investing in productivity, investing in being more profitable; and we've got lots of cases where we can show that. The business case has been proven.\n\"Good management requires that you listen to people. Even if you are a small company, there are many little things that don't require lots of money. You can take advantage of free smoking cessation classes. You can introduce a lunchtime walking club. You might have a yoga session at the end of the day.\n\"Our NHS is so busy dealing with people who are ill that it is very difficult to spend a lot of time and energy on prevention. As we're living longer, we're expected to work longer, so all of these things are an additional pressure, and it's really important for the workplace to play its part.\n\"Then I believe we will access our health service less, we will be healthier, and we will be a saving and a gain to the NHS.\"\nProf John Ashton is president of the Faculty of Public Health.\n\"I'm very interested in how we live as we get older. Health and housing are indivisible. They are also indivisible from living in a good, supportive neighbourhood.\n\"In 1948, when the health service was founded, the Department of Health was the Department of Health and Housing.\n\"How can we reconnect these two important areas to make it possible for people who are living longer to live a full life in the community?\n\"A new generation of better designed and more attractive homes for the elderly would provide a healthier living environment for many who currently live alone in homes that are too large and insufficiently adapted to their needs.\n\"A return to the 'almshouse' model would provide a supportive environment, free from the isolation and the mental health problems which loneliness can cause.\n\"It could also help alleviate the housing crisis for younger people trying to buy their first home.\n\"As we contemplate all those baby boomers reaching 85 in less than 20 years, we have time to plan and get it right.\n\"But it's time we got on with it.\"\nLord Crisp was chief executive of the NHS between 2000 and 2006. He is an independent member of the House of Lords, and co-chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health.\n\"The election of a new government is a great opportunity to change the direction and the mood for health provision in the UK.\n\"The World Health Organisation got it right when it said 'modern societies actively market unhealthy lifestyles'. We need to turn this round so we're creating healthy lifestyles.\n\"The NHS was a great coming together of everyone involved in health services to deliver healthcare to the whole population. We need all those parts of society that affect health to come together into a new compact. And we need to be explicit about this everywhere in the country.\n\"We need to release the NHS and the remarkable people in it to create a long-term plan for transition. There is already remarkable consensus about what needs to be done, and we need a transition fund to support development and the double running of services as changes are made.\n\"There's a wonderful African saying: 'health is made at home, hospital is for repairs'. Health is made at home, and in our communities.\n\"The NHS - with all the important services we all rely on - will only be sustainable if we all play our part in developing a health-creating society.\n\"We do know how to do it. It's time to act.\"\nThe final part of Healthy Visions will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Friday 3 April at 13:45 BST.

But even in a career full of ups and downs, what happened to Hamilton in the Malaysian Grand Prix takes some beating.\nEight points down on team-mate Nico Rosberg following the German's impressive win in the previous race in Singapore, Hamilton drove a perfect weekend, with scintillating pace in qualifying followed by a dominant performance in the race.\nWith Rosberg on course for fourth place after a strong drive from the back of the field after being turned around by Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari at the first corner, it looked as if that deficit was going to be wiped out in one go, and Hamilton would be back at the head of the championship.\nBut then a trail of smoke appeared from the back of Hamilton's car as he headed down the pit straight with 17 laps to go.\n\"Oh no, no,\" Hamilton said over the radio. He climbed out with flames licking from the exhaust and crouched down with his head in his hands, and it was clear what he was thinking: Why me? Why now? I just can't believe it.\nClearly distraught, he said in broadcast interviews straight afterwards that he wanted to know why of all the eight drivers using Mercedes engines only he was suffering these problems.\n\"Someone has to give me some answers because it's just not acceptable,\" he said. \"It just doesn't sit right with me.\"\nSome interpreted that as Hamilton implying he felt there was some kind of conspiracy at Mercedes to stop him winning this year - as many of his fans on social media have been claiming all season. Never mind that it would not make sense, that there is no logical reason for it, and that it would be next to impossible to orchestrate in this way.\nIn any case, asked to explain later on, Hamilton instead pointed to his strong religious beliefs.\n\"A higher power,\" he said. \"It feels right now as if the man above or a higher power is intervening a little bit. But I feel I have been blessed with so many opportunities. So I have to be grateful for those. While this does not feel great, I have to remain grateful.\"\nAll year, since the consecutive engine failures in qualifying at the Chinese and Russian Grands Prix, Hamilton has felt as if the odds were being stacked against him this year.\nThose failures were largely - although not entirely - to blame for his emerging from the first four races staring down a 43-point deficit to Rosberg. Bad starts in Australia and Bahrain also played their part.\nWhen the two Mercedes drivers crashed out together on the first lap of the next race in Spain, and Mercedes F1 non-executive chairman Niki Lauda came right out and said on live TV that he felt Hamilton had been to blame - not a unanimous view, it has to be said - Hamilton was at a very low ebb, he has admitted.\nBut he bounced back, won six of the next seven races, and took a 19-point lead into the summer break.\nThen it went wrong again. The engine failures were always going to mean a back-of-the-grid start somewhere for using too many engines - and that came in Belgium at the end of August as Mercedes stockpiled enough power units to get him to the end of the year.\nHe fought back superbly to finish third there, but then a bad start from pole squandered a potential win in Italy, and Rosberg won in Singapore, where Hamilton struggled all weekend.\nSuddenly, Rosberg had won three races in a row and for Hamilton a 19-point lead had become an eight-point deficit, and he had all that work to do again. And now this.\nIf Mercedes were upset with Hamilton for his initial remarks, they did a very good job of hiding it.\nStraight after the race, boss Toto Wolff said: \"I have no words. I am so gutted for Lewis. He was in control of that race. Not good. It's clear he is super-frustrated.\"\nAfter a team meeting to discuss the situation, Wolff was equally understanding.\n\"Every remark, every answer is allowed after such a frustrating moment,\" he said. \"If you are in the lead and just about to get back into the lead of the championship and the engine blows up, he is allowed to say whatever he wants. It is emotional and completely understandable.\"\nAs to why it was happening, Wolff said: \"We sat down and said how is this possible? It is a fresh situation that has no rational explanation and I think after recovering a bit he just sees that. In the heat of the moment, no problem.\"\nA couple of hours after the race, Hamilton faced the written media in his usual news conference, which was initially cancelled - \"a mutual decision,\" Mercedes said - and then reinstated because \"following discussion with Lewis, he wishes to complete his press call\".\nWas Hamilton suspicious, he was asked, that there might be some kind of sabotage?\n\"You have to understand from my point,\" Hamilton said. \"On one side we have had the most incredible success these last two years, for which I am incredibly grateful. These guys work so hard and we are all feeling the pain right now.\n\"When you get out of the car, the feeling you have after leading and the car fails, it is pretty hard to say positive things.\n\"But Mercedes have built 43 engines or whatever it is and I have happened to have most of if not all the failures. That is definitely a tough thing. But I have 100% confidence and faith in these guys. I love it here. Without them I would not have won these extra two championships.\n\"While the struggle is real right now and has been this year, I honestly feel it is constantly a test of will, of my spirit and who I am as a person to get back in and keep fighting it head on. It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up.\n\"That doesn't just apply to me. I saw tears in the eyes of my mechanics, so I know we all feel the pain.\n\"We have to bear in mind what we have already built. And while this does not look good, there are still five races to go, I don't know if my two engines will make it, but I can only hope. And if I perform as I have this weekend then everything is all to play for.\"\nBut he added that he would still be looking for an explanation as to what was going on.\n\"I need to understand why these keep happening on us,\" he said.\n\"Forty-three engines. There are eight cars out there powered by the same engine as mine and mine happens to fail and for Mercedes I am the number one driver. So for sure when these things happen I want to understand what that is and how they are going to make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\nTwenty three points sound - and are - a lot. It is two points shy of a clear win, and there are only five races remaining with a maximum of 125 points still available.\nThe size of the task is clear when you think that if Hamilton wins every race from now on with Rosberg second, it will take four races before the Englishman is back in the lead.\nThe thing is, though, Hamilton is more than capable of doing that if he consistently performs at his best.\nHe won six races out of seven from May to July this year. Ten of the first 16 in 2015. And in 2014 four of the first five, and then five in a row after falling 29 points behind Rosberg following their controversial collision at the Belgian Grand Prix that year.\nWolff said: \"The championship is not over. Lewis had a massive blow; that's clear. But let them battle it out hopefully without any reliability woes and see how it plays out.\"\nHamilton said: \"I will continue to fight but if at the end of the year the higher power does not want me to be champion with everything I have given towards it, I have to accept that.\n\"But as long as I end my year knowing I have given it everything and done everything I possibly could and we have, that is all you can ask for.\"\nIf he pulls it off, it would almost certainly be his greatest achievement. That, in itself, is a reason to keep going.\nNot that he will need one.

By putting forward a proposal for a debate with seven leaders, \"we'll actually see one take place\", he said.\nMr Miliband said he did not accept the prime minister's excuse and accused him of \"running scared\" from TV debates.\n\"I'll debate him, any time, any place, anywhere. He should stop ducking and weaving and he should name the date,\" said the Labour leader.\n\"I think what the public will not tolerate is a prime minister who is running away from them (the debates), running away from his record and running away from a face-to-face debate with me that he said he wanted and the public deserve.\"\nLib Dem election campaign chief Lord Ashdown said Mr Cameron was \"running scared\" and was \"frightened of defending his own position\".\n\"What he is proposing is not just a ludicrous, seven-sided, bite-sized squabble fest but actually he is proposing it takes place before the Conservative manifesto is published,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nMr Clegg said: \"If David Cameron is too busy or too important to defend the record of this government with Ed Miliband then I offer myself.  How about that?  I'll do it instead.\"\nHe told LBC radio the Conservative leadership was behaving like \"they're ordering a drink in the drawing room of Downton Abbey and, sort of, telling everybody else what they should do\". He said:  \"I mean it's not for one party to, you know, grandly tell everybody else what's going to happen.\"\nUnder Mr Cameron's \"final offer\", one 90-minute contest would take place before 30 March, when the official general election campaign starts.\nDowning Street said the Democratic Unionist Party should also be considered for inclusion.\nThe broadcasters, who have proposed a total of three debates, said they would respond to the Conservatives' proposal in due course.\nThe BBC and ITV are scheduled to hold two, both involving the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the Greens.\nA third debate - hosted by Sky and Channel 4 - the week before the 7 May election would feature a head-to-head between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband.\nAfter Mr Cameron questioned the timing of it at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Sky and Channel 4 offered to move the event to a different date if the leaders could agree.\nSo are the debates dead?\nWell, maybe not. But only if the broadcasters hold their nerve.\nIn other words, if they decide to press ahead with the three debates and empty chair the prime minister.\nIt would be a huge decision - and many at Westminster remain sceptical that the BBC would be willing to do this.\nHowever, privately, the broadcasters insist they will not buckle and will not allow one party to \"dictate\" the conditions.\nThey insist the single, 90-minute, seven, or even eight party, debate proposed by the prime minister will \"not cover the ground\".\nAnd crucially, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats say they will still turn up for whatever debates the broadcasters decide to hold.\nEd Miliband will even take part in the head-to-head without David Cameron - and subject himself to a grilling from Jeremy Paxman.\nSenior Lib Dems say Nick Clegg would be ready to stand in for the prime minister in the final head-to-head, making it a Miliband v Clegg clash.\nThe danger for the prime minister is that even if the debates lose their impact without him - he risks a backlash from voters for failing to take part.\nDowning Street's hope is that the broadcasters will buckle and either agree to his proposal or just scrap the whole idea of TV debates for this election.\nA UKIP spokesman said: \"After praising what a good thing debates were for democracy as recently as 2014, why is David Cameron now acting chicken and running as far away from them as possible?\"\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron had \"sabotaged the whole thing\" with his proposal, which would not be a \"proper debate\".\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr Cameron of \"arrogance,\" adding: \"I will debate him anytime, anywhere, on any number of occasions.\n\"However we have accepted the broadcasters' proposals, and believe we should stick with that, rather than allow a Tory prime minister to dictate the terms of debate.\"\nThe Green Party has accused Mr Cameron of \"further damaging trust\" in British politics.\n\"Not only is Cameron's announcement cowardly but it also shows his contempt for the electorate. People want to see a set of debates between all major party leaders, yet the prime minister is clearly scared of scrutiny,\" said a spokesman.\nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said Mr Cameron's \"efforts to manipulate the broadcasters are unacceptable and arrogant\".\nSpeaking after his party's appeal to be included was rejected, Nigel Dodds, the DUP's Westminster leader, said: \"I think that the decision of the BBC Trust defies belief, quite frankly, because it's wrong, irrational, and unjust to exclude Northern Ireland from the national debates if you are going to include the Scottish National Party from Scotland and Plaid Cymru from Wales.\"\nAs leader of the opposition, Mr Cameron led calls for televised debates at the 2010 general election - the first time they have been held in the UK.\nBut he has since criticised the idea of holding debates in the run up to polling day, saying they had \"sucked the life out of the campaign\".\nAfter months of wrangling over the format for debates at the 2015 election, Downing Street issued a statement on Wednesday night, confirming that Mr Cameron did not want to go head-to-head with Labour leader Ed Miliband under any circumstances.\nIn a letter to the broadcasters, the prime minister's communications chief Craig Oliver said: \"In order to cut through this chaotic situation I am willing to make the following proposal: There should be one 90-minute debate between seven party leaders before the short campaign.\"\nHe added: \"In order for it to be organised in time, the debate should take place during the week beginning March 23.

Having been the editor of numerous broadcast news and current affairs programmes, I know this is ample time to organise a programme.\n\"This is our final offer, and to be clear, given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign, the prime minister will not be participating in more than one debate.\"\nIn a joint statement, broadcasters said: \"The BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky have received an email from the prime minister's office with a proposal.\n\"The broadcasters are committed to providing our audiences with election debates.\n\"Twenty two million people watched the debates in 2010 and we believe the debates helped people to engage with the election.\n\"The broadcasters have set out their proposals and continue to talk to all the relevant parties on an equitable basis.\n\"We will respond to the Conservatives' proposal in due course.\"", "summary": "David Cameron has denied claims he is scared of TV election debates, saying he wanted to \"get on\" with his proposal for a seven-way contest.", "id": "31745808", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

Watford striker Troy Deeney, who has faced them twice this season, tells Match of the Day 2 what it is like trying to break down the Leicester back four.\nDeeney: \"I have played against every Premier League defence this season for Watford, and Leicester's Robert Huth is the toughest opponent I have faced.\n\"Huth is the sort of centre-half who will let you know he is there, so to speak, with a challenge or two early in the game.\n\"But when I got my chance, I made sure I let him know I was about too. To be fair, he did not seem to mind.\n\"Like his team-mate Wes Morgan, who I had many battles with in the Championship earlier in our careers, Huth is old-school - an out-and-out defender who really enjoys the physical side of the game.\n\"That is normally the side I thrive on too, but I did not have much joy against the German. He is horrible to play against, in the most complimentary way.\n\"He heads it, he kicks it, and he kicks you - anything - he does not care, as long as the ball does not go in.\n\"Huth is not a player who gives you verbals when you are out on the pitch - in both games against him this season, he hardly talked to me.\n\"But in terms of talking to each other, the whole Leicester defence never stopped for the entire game, including Kasper Schmeichel in goal.\n\"And if Danny Drinkwater did not hear the right call then he was always going back from midfield and asking what was what too. That is one of the reasons they are so well organised at the back.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDeeney: \"Part of my job leading the line for Watford is to occupy centre-halves - by that I mean those battles with Huth, say, to try to win headers when the ball is played forward.\n\"But I also look to bring centre-halves out of position to the flanks and make space for my team-mates in the middle.\n\"It is difficult to do that against Leicester because their centre-halves, Huth and Wes Morgan, never put themselves in danger of being isolated.\n\"When Watford had the ball in wide areas they kind of left us to it, and concentrated on dealing with the cross rather than stopping it being put in.\n\"Huth and Morgan take two positions - one takes the near post and the other takes the middle of the box near the penalty spot as if to say 'go on, cross it, and we will deal with it'.\"\nDeeney: \"The other thing that makes it harder to break down Leicester than the other top teams is that both their full-backs are very switched-on defensively.\n\"Most full-backs in the Premier League bomb on now, and I don't want to be disrespectful to them but it is often a lot easier when you are up against a right winger who has been switched to a right-back.\n\"It seems to be more about how good they are going forward, and there are not many who are as solid as Danny Simpson and Christian Fuchs are for Leicester.\n\"Yes, they can join the attack too, as Fuchs showed with his cross for their winner against Southampton, but if he is forward down the left then you know Simpson will drop in rather than getting up the pitch down the right too.\n\"The whole team all know their jobs, from front to back, and they all work very hard too.\n\"I am not surprised to find out that Shinji Okazaki is the most substituted player in the Premier League this season, because he runs himself into the ground every time.\n\"It would be easy for the likes of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy to say 'we are too good for this' but they don't.\n\"Leicester are still playing the same counter-attacking football they were playing home and away in the first half of the season, but they are getting better at it and I can see why they have only lost three league games out of 32 so far.\"\nDeeney: \"When the ball was played forward to me against Leicester, I had to try to bring it down and hold it up with Huth behind me grappling with me and putting me under pressure.\n\"Then you have also got N'Golo Kante and Danny Drinkwater buzzing around you too.\n\"Kante was just everywhere against us - I was watching the Southampton game in the Match of the Day 2 production office and he was the same in that match too.\n\"If he is taking a breather, which is not often, then Drinkwater is there doing exactly the same.\n\"You don't know where they are coming from, but you know they are coming, so when you have got the ball you are thinking 'I need to lay it off quickly'.\n\"It works so well because they are both so energetic. If one of them gets forward, then he knows the other has got the legs to cover for him.\n\"If teams want to come through the middle, they have to get past those two first.\n\"And, as we saw against Southampton, you don't just have to get past Kante, you have to keep him behind you, which is the hardest part. He has been the best midfielder in the Premier League this season.\"\nDeeney: \"With Kante and Drinkwater in the middle, in front of their centre-halves, they kind of funnel teams wide, and invite them to cross.\n\"As I said earlier, Huth and Morgan are waiting for the ball to come in but what makes Leicester different from a lot of the top teams is that their full-backs are prepared for it too.\n\"Dealing with crosses at the back post might be a weakness with some of those sides who have wingers at full-back because they are less likely to win headers, but Simpson and Fuchs tuck in and know what they have to do.\n\"They are very effective when the ball comes in and it means that, as a striker, you cannot pull on to them to avoid the big centre-halves either.\n\"Allowing teams to cross is part of their attacking ploy too.\n\"Leicester are the kind of team that want you to get a little bit confident when you come forward, thinking you are on top.\n\"Then, when you commit men forward and are getting excited because you are having all these crosses and think the momentum is with you, that is when they pounce with a quick break using the pace of their forwards.\"\nDeeney: \"The support that Leicester get at the King Power Stadium is the kind of thing that will help them get over the line.\n\"If the team is nervy, like they were at the back end of Sunday's game, then their fans are not stupid - they realised their team needed them and raised the noise levels again.\n\"Part of that is down to the thousands of cardboard clappers the club leave out on the seats for fans before games.\n\"I think that actually started in the Championship play-offs in 2013, when we beat them in the semi-finals.\n\"I remember it being a bit annoying in the first leg at their place when their fans were using them but, now I am playing in the Premier League, I actually appreciated the noise when we went there.\n\"I don't want to sound too critical, but a lot of fans at some grounds I go to have got cameras in their hands, taking pictures of anything rather than generating any atmosphere during the game.\n\"At Leicester, it was all about getting behind their team.\"\nTroy Deeney was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "Another Leicester clean sheet, another Leicester win.", "id": "35955616", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nLeicester City's Robert Huth (left) and Watford's Troy Deeney battle for the ball during the Premier League match at the King Power Stadium, Leicester.\nLeicester City's Robert Huth (left) and Watford's Troy Deeney battle for the ball during the Premier League match at the King Power Stadium, Leicester.

My place wasn't there anymore,\" he said.\n\"After I left, the club contacted me to come back. I didn't feel comfortable about the risk. I could see how volatile it was and I had a family to think about as well.\n\"It was very hard to say no, but life is more important than playing and this is what I had to choose for my family.\"\nFollowing a short stint in the UAE, Saleh turned his attention to coaching when he joined Al-Asalah in Jordan, staying for two years, and helping them win promotion to the top flight in 2015.\nHe admits he and his family were \"lucky\" to get the call from the UN to resettle in the East Midlands, along with three other families from Syria, when there are hundreds of thousands who risk their lives trying to seek asylum by boat and set off on exhausting treks towards safety on foot.\n\"Because I was working as a coach in Jordan I wasn't forced to make that hard decision to leave like that,\" Saleh said.\n\"It's tough for them to make that decision. They have nothing to survive, they take the risk because they have no other option.\"\nIt is a cold drizzly English morning outside as Saleh sits on the couch flicking through a pile of photographs - pictures of trophy celebrations, of him training and playing for Al-Karamah - and watches highlights from his playing days on YouTube.\nHe pauses on the 2010 Syria Cup final against Al-Nawair when he saved two penalties in a shootout on the way to victory.\n\"They are memories I cherish,\" he said.\nIn a room where the walls are adorned with sheets of paper on which English words are written alongside Arabic equivalents, Saleh says he is determined to make the most of his new start in Mansfield.\nHe talks about how he has learned 100 new words in the past two weeks and begins to rattle them off one after another.\nHis sons, who watch video clips of English nursery rhymes and sing along to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, help their parents get a grasp of the language by pointing at a number chart to test their knowledge.\n\"One major factor in coming to this country is my children. I want them to have a safe place to learn and flourish - to become something, to have a future,\" Saleh said.\n\"We have come here to add to society, not to be a burden. This is what we strive for.\"\nBefore being told he would be relocated to England, all Saleh knew of the country was football.\nHis favourite club is Chelsea and he is also an admirer of Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.\nSaleh obtained his Fifa goalkeeping qualifications and completed an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) C coaching license before leaving Jordan.\nAnd while he and his family are taking weekly English lessons, he has also enrolled in an activity leadership course at Vision West Nottinghamshire College.\nRachael Evans, Saleh's tutor at college, says he works hard to cope with the language barrier, filling his personal dictionary with key phrases and handy sentences.\n\"He does quite a bit of underlining, any key word he doesn't know is underlined,\" she said.\n\"When I see him strolling the corridors learning new words from the book where he writes everything, it is an inspiration. He is an inspiration to other students with the commitment he shows.\n\"He never stops, when he gets in he is already reading his notes, then in the class he is always wanting to learn, asking questions, speaking to other teachers.\n\"He is real motivation and you think 'that is why I come to work'.\"\nSaleh is also involved as goalkeeper coach for the college team and as a member of the volunteering and leadership academies.\n\"Even though everything is tough because my English is not that good, I'm trying my best,\" he said.\n\"I'm the kind of person who is very persistent and determined and I will pursue what I want to do.

The Bristol-born 22-year-old also had the option of playing for Wales after qualifying under the three-year residency rule.\nWith Danny Care suspended after his drink-driving charge and Wigglesworth among those on the injured list, scrum-half Dickson's inclusion was widely expected after some fine displays in the Aviva Premiership this season.\nDowson, 30, has been on the fringes of the England senior squad for several years now, while his Saints back-row partner Clark, 22, is perhaps the boldest selection.\nWhile back-row James Haskell is unavailable as he enjoys a sabbatical in Japan, Lancaster included Stade Francais lock Tom Palmer as an exception to the Rugby Football Union's stated intention to only pick home-based players.\nEngland's 32-man Elite Player Squad for the Six Nations Championship:\nForwards: Props: A Corbisiero (London Irish), D Cole (Leicester Tigers), J Marler (Harlequins), M Stevens (Saracens), D Wilson (Bath Rugby); Hookers: D Hartley (Northampton Saints), L Mears (Bath Rugby), R Webber (London Wasps); Locks: M Botha (Saracens), L Deacon (Leicester Tigers), C Lawes (Northampton Saints), T Palmer (Stade Francais).

For the longest time, that was the extent of the action. This was dull, sloppy, lifeless football. Tynecastle, a place capable of delivering such raucous atmospheres, was mostly hushed until the endgame, when they booed.\nThe home side could have made it two just before the break, but an Arnaud Djoum shot was tipped away and soon after an Igor Rossi header slapped off the Partick crossbar. Beyond that, there was nothing but the sound of cheering from the visiting fans and the continuing sound of disgruntlement among their opposite numbers.\nThe vibe in Tynecastle grew ever more antsy in the early minutes of the second half when Welsh headed Partick level. It was the first time they had stirred as an attacking force and it sparked something in Alan Archibald's team.\nNine minutes later, Ade Adeez was played through one-on-one with Hamilton and should have scored. Instead, Hamilton kicked away his shot and Hearts survived.\nThe fractiousness of Tynecastle was palpable now. At one point, as Partick took hold of the game, Don Cowie felt the need to gesture to his own supporters, lowering the palms of his hands to the ground, urging them all to calm down.\nSave for the odd flurry from Hearts, the visitors dominated the second half. There was an extraordinary passage 10 minutes from time when they created three excellent chances in quick order.\nFirstly, Booth rifled a shot off Hamilton's crossbar, then the goalkeeper denied Chris Erskine with a fine save and just after that Liam Lindsay thumped a header over the Hearts crossbar when he really ought to have scored.\nHamilton had to rescue his team again four minutes from the end when Doolan threatened to win it. They would have deserved to. Partick should have left Edinburgh with three points, not one.\nOn the full time whistle, the home fans let their team have it, booing loudly, if briefly. This was not how it was supposed to be in Cathro's new era.\nHearts head coach Ian Cathro: \"Initially we were able to win a bit of control. We started the game well. We had some good periods of possession in the opponent's half. There was some good performances. In the second half we didn't have that control.\n\"At the end of that we all feel the same thing. Voicing that is completely normal. What we've got to do is stay together, support each other and continue to make progress. That will be thing that changes things quickly.\"\nPartick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: \"I thought we were dominant in the second half. We scored a goal at a good time to get us back into the game after a disappointing first half. Then we were on the front foot and we created a number of very, very good chances. Enough to probably win two games and it's hard to do that at Tynecastle.\n\"It's an intimidating place to come, you have to enjoy it and try and turn the home fans against their team. We did that in the second half. It helped us create chances and made them a bit more nervy at the back.\n\"We've got a tough run of fixtures now. Winnable games but we know they're teams around about us and we need to take points from them.\"\nMatch ends, Heart of Midlothian 1, Partick Thistle 1.\nSecond Half ends, Heart of Midlothian 1, Partick Thistle 1.\nCorner,  Heart of Midlothian.

Save Porter Ranch!\"\nThe company has resisted such calls, warning that closing the entire site could imperil the Los Angeles energy supply, although it was unable to provide a figure for the proportion of the city's gas supplied by Aliso Canyon.\n\"We could have shortages of natural gas, blackouts for electricity, that's not something that we want to happen to the Los Angeles area,\" said SoCal Gas spokesman Mike Mizrahi. He denied that meant the company thought it worth the risk of leaks to keep the lights on.\n\"I wouldn't actually even call it a risk of leaks. We've operated this storage facility in good working order for 40 years. Safety is part of our DNA,\" he said.\nThree months after it began though, Mr Mizrahi conceded that the firm still did not know what had caused the leak.\nThe company, he insisted, had complied with all relevant state and federal regulations in the run-up to the incident, although it had removed a safety valve in 1979. Some experts have argued this valve could have stopped the leak, a claim SoCal Gas denies.\nAt Thursday's public meeting some of the loudest cheers came when Ms Hill attacked the state regulators: the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which regulates privately owned utilities, and the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), which oversees the operation of wells.\n\"It is obvious to all of us now that SoCal Gas is allowed to do whatever they want,\" she said, adding that an \"incestuous relationship\" between the company and its regulators must end.\nAccording to the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, who earlier this month declared a state of emergency in Porter Ranch, CPUC and DOGGR have ordered an \"independent third-party analysis\" of the cause of the leak.\nSoCal Gas has promised that it will be plugged by the end of February and the single well in question, a depleted oil field known as SS-25, will be taken out of use.\nThe use of old oil and gas wells for storing natural gas is relatively common in the United States, according to industry bodies.\nSoCal Gas said the leak began when the casing around a pipe was breached at a depth of about 500ft (150m) although it was unable to say why this had happened.\nInitial attempts to plug it failed. The company then drew up plans to capture and burn off the excess gas, but abandoned them amid concerns that it could lead to a catastrophic explosion.\n1.77 million: approximate number of cows burping for a year to produce equivalent methane\n1.41 million: number of cars that would need to be added to the road to have a similar greenhouse effect in a year\n13,000: number of people who have been relocated so far\nBelching cows and the LA methane leak\nThe firm is now drilling a relief well to a depth of about 8,500ft to reduce the pressure of the escaping gas, the roar of which can reportedly be heard up to half a mile away.\nThe company attributes ill effects such as nausea, nosebleeds and headaches not to the invisible natural gas itself but to a sulphurous odorant added to it to make it easier to detect a leak.\nSome residents have complained of breathing difficulties as well as severe stress as they were forced to move to temporary accommodation and send their children to new schools.\nAbout 13,000 people in 3,340 homes had been relocated, with a further 11,000 or so in 2,810 homes waiting to move, the company said.\nMusic producer Matt Pakucko is one of those who has moved out. Until October he worked from home just over a mile from the leaking well at the foot of the hills which rise above Porter Ranch.\nHe now says he can only return to the recording studio in his house when the wind is blowing the gas away.\n\"It's been a nightmare,\" said Mr Pakucko, who is the co-founder of a residents' action group, Save Porter Ranch.\nBefore the leak, he was already campaigning for the entire facility to be shut down, arguing that the \"regulators have completely failed\" to protect the community.\n\"This is not a Porter Ranch problem. This is a global environmental disaster,\" he said.\nThe effect of the leak on human health is contested.\nSoCal Gas insists there is no evidence that it poses a long-term risk but some scientists say there are not enough data to be sure, particularly about the effect of mercaptans, which give the gas its smell, and benzene, a carcinogenic organic compound in the natural gas.\n\"There's concern for some of the exposures for neurodevelopment in children, for respiratory effects,\" said Frank Gilliland, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California's Division of Environmental and Occupational Health.\nBut the \"most likely effect\" said Prof Gilliland was \"from chronic stress from the whole disaster scenario that's happened\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.for post-traumatic stress that occurs in the population.\"\nThe scientist is seeking approval to carry out research into the health effects of the leak.\nThe effect of the leak on the environment is a little clearer thanks to measurements of the potent greenhouse gas methane.\nAccording to pilot and scientist Dr Steve Conley of the University of California, Davis, who has been collecting the samples on a series of flights in the area, it could account for \"roughly 10% of California's total methane emissions for the year.\"\n\"As a society we need to learn the lesson from this that we need to be more ready to respond when it happens,\" he added.\nThe lawyers are now sharpening their pencils, with the possibility of a class action lawsuit bringing together thousands of claims against SoCal Gas.\nMs Brockovich, who as a consumer advocate is working with the law firm Weitz and Luxenberg, said the Porter Ranch case should raise awareness of similar problems elsewhere.\nAcross the country, she said, \"lack of oversight, lack of inspections and lack of enforcement\" was now being exposed and challenged.\n\"We absolutely have failing infrastructures in the oil and gas industry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 these things are corroded, they're dilapidated, they're in need of repair, they're in need of replacement, they need to be shut down and it is a problem across the United States.\"", "summary": "Environmental activist Erin Brockovich has told the BBC that failing infrastructure and weak regulation are to blame for a catastrophic gas leak in California.", "id": "35379786", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe leak in Porter Ranch near Los Angeles has forced more than 13,000 people from their homes.

Marling has a reputation for being a shy, sometimes reluctant interviewee - but LA clearly has rubbed off on her.\nShe chews gum as we talk, laughing bawdily as she discusses her penchant for dating drummers. (\"What do they bring to a relationship? Rhythm!\")\nThe 27-year-old also reveals her mum keeps a \"very meticulous scrapbook\" of her career, and admits to cooking up her own brand of Halloumi cheese.\n\"I'm aiming for direct competition with Alex James,\" she says, referring to the cheese-making Blur bassist. \"But bloody hell, what a boring thing to talk about\".\nSo instead we circle back to that new album.\nIt's her sixth, and possibly best, record since she emerged at the age of 17 as part of the indie folk movement that also spawned Mumford and Sons, Lucy Rose and Noah and the Whale.\nSumptuous and sensual, Semper Femina adds a hint of West Coast sheen to her delicate, acoustic melodies. Marling generously credits her band and producer Blake Mills for the progression.\n\"All of the musicality of the album is down to them,\" she says. \"I wanted to be in the middle of it, but for someone else to be painting the picture around it.\"\nIf you don't have a Latin textbook to hand, the album's title is taken from a line in Virgil's epic poem The Aeneid.\nThe line is \"varium et mutabile semper femina\", which translates as \"woman is always fickle and changeable\". \"I thought that was very jolly,\" says Marling, apparently without sarcasm.\nShe came across the phrase years ago and had a truncated version - \"Semper Femina\", or \"always a woman\" - tattooed on her leg when she was 21.\nIt's a fitting title for a record that explores femininity in all its forms, from the archetypal wild teenager to the artist's muse, while reflecting on female friendships and betrayals.\nMarling prompted a lot of speculation when she announced in a press release that the album was written during a \"masculine time\" in her life, after she had \"gone on this trip of abandoning any sexuality\".\nShe clarifies that today, saying she was simply trying to write about women from a \"neutral perspective\". But she admits LA prompted a period of androgyny.\n\"People there are just a bit more far-out,\" she explains. \"Nobody's got a job, they can dress however they want. A lot of my friends are queer or gender-fluid. So I was picking up on that.\n\"Then there was also my natural relationship with [womanhood]. I'm unsure. I'm unsure of my own femininity or masculinity.\n\"There are some circumstances in which I employ more of a masculine approach in order to protect myself; and there are circumstances where I indulge in my more feminine side because that vulnerability seems more important.\n\"I'm interested in the differences between men and women, of which there are plenty, and they need to be understood better.\"\nSuch as?\n\"Well, I was talking to my producer, Blake, and he said he started playing guitar to impress girls. I think when I started playing guitar, it was to impress my dad.\n\"So Blake's relationship to his instrument is very different to mine and his reason for writing songs is very different to mine but, at the same time, he is extraordinary. And so those differences can be great.\n\"You can reduce it down to an Eastern idea that men expend energy and women are self-perpetuating.\"\nOne of the album's big themes is how women are observed - both by men and each other.\nOn Wild Fire, Marling talks about a friend who keeps a \"pen behind her ear\" and constantly jots down her thoughts in a notepad.\n\"Of course the only part that I want to read is about her time spent with me,\" the singer drawls.\n\"Wouldn't you die to know how you're seen? Are you getting away with who you're trying to be?\"\nThat's a perennial question for a performer - especially one who seems so cautious of the limelight.\n\"Would I die to know how I'm seen?\" she asks herself, when the lyric is brought up. \"I don't know!\n\"I'm aware, obviously, that I'm looked at and considered and reviewed and criticised. But I'm pretty good at steering pretty clear of those [articles], unless they're delivered to me by my mother.\"\nOn Nouel, she turns the tables - objectifying one of her real-life friends as a classic muse.\n\"Oh Nouel, you sing so well / Sing only for me?\" Marling pleads, going on to compare her friend to Gustave Courbet's Origine Du Monde - an 1866 painting of a woman sprawled naked on a bed.\n\"I was interested in what it is like to be made a muse,\" says Marling. \"Nouel is a person who exists, a visual artist I know in Los Angeles, and I took her essence and I exaggerated it into a fantasy.\n\"She [Nouel] was very flattered by it - but then again she was able to remove herself from it.\n\"It's her but it's not her. I haven't painted a picture of her - it's my projection of my feelings about how extraordinary I feel she is.\"\nIn black and white this all seems very intellectual and, well, pretentious.\nMarling is quite aware of how it comes across, poking fun at the \"pseudo-science\" and \"pop psychology\" she espouses.\nOn the album she even sings, \"Lately I wonder if all my pondering takes up too much ground?\"\nBut the music breathes warm life into these high concepts, resulting in a romantic, confessional suite of songs.\nBy the last track, Nothing Not Nearly, Marling has put all the contemplation aside to observe: \"Nothing matters more than love. No nothing. Not nearly.\"\nIt reflects her current, contented state of mind.\n\"I'm loving my late twenties,\" she says. \"The closer I get to 30, the more at ease I feel with myself.\"\nEach of her albums has contributed to that sense of self, she continues.\n\"This one was about understanding femininity and masculinity. The last one was understanding solitude.\n\"Before that was heartbreak, before that was freedom and before that was anger. It's like I'm tackling the world one emotion at a time!\"\nSo what's next? Rebellion? Passion? Paranoia?\n\"Possibly. Or fear, given the era that we're seemingly stepping into,\" she says. \"It's not been good.\"\nShe talks about the \"horrifying but unbearably addictive quality\" of President Trump, saying she's constantly checking her phone for the latest update.\nWhile the Trump era has already prompted a surge in political protest songs, Marling has trouble viewing this as a positive.\n\"I don't think anyone would wish that on the world for the sake of writing a good song. That's not the purpose of art - to encounter animosity for the sake of having something to do.\n\"A singer, who's now a big singer, once said to me: 'It'd be so cool to be really heartbroken because it'd be good for my songwriting.\"\n\"I was like, 'You silly, naive wally!' Never wish that on yourself. It's unbearable.\"\nSemper Femina is out on 10 March.

The older students will also code them.\nProgramming is changing briskly.\nCoding in the cloud is one trend likely to carry on, spreading collaborators across continents.\nSo also is the explosion of new languages, like Facebook's Hack scripting language or Apple's Swift, alongside classical tongues like C and Java.\nWe're likely to learn to code younger, and differently. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) child-friendly programming language Scratch has 6.2 million registered users.\nThe Internet of Things, driverless cars, and drones will all yield more programmable platforms - but will coding for your cappuccino maker drastically change programming?\nAnd what will the coding workplace be like, when today's Raspberry rugrats have grown into tomorrow's programming prodigies?\nOne interesting facet of the last 15 years is how little programming languages have changed.\nThen and now, C and C++ dominate programming at deep, or highly-optimised levels.\nOne level up, C-derived languages - objective C and ones resembling C in syntax, like Java and Microsoft's C# - are in fashion for running most applications.\nThen at the top, there is a big brace of scripting languages, like Perl, Python (named after Monty Python), and PHP, which is often used as glue for sticking together programs to build a complete system.\nScripting languages live in a rich environment, with large numbers of links to other programs, says Daniel Kroening, professor of computer science at the University of Oxford.\nSome, like Haskell in quantitative finance, are dominant in niches because of available frameworks and libraries.\nFortran (first released in 1957, though much evolved since) continues to be used for scientific programming, including weather forecasting and climate-change modelling.\nAnd there is JavaScript, the predominant language for programming to run in a web browser.\nThe spread of computing to new platforms - down to your car and toaster - will bring new challenges in building bigger, more connected systems.\nScripting languages tend to be loosely typed, allowing a single variable to contain a number, a bit of text, or other character.\nThis makes writing small programs easier, faster, and more fragile.\nAgile development has been another new trend, with frequent feedback between programmers and users - the gov.uk website is an example.\nBut then you have the million-line behemoth programs, with more opportunities for inconsistencies and bugs to creep in.\nBBC iWonder\nINTERACTIVE: Can you fix these traffic lights with code?\nDoes knowing a bit of code lead to your dream job?\nAnother trend has been an increased number of languages coming out of the corporate world, rather than universities. This permits companies to have more control over which direction the languages take.\n\"Nowadays, by accident, Facebook have a million lines of PHP, and they wish they didn't,\" says Alan Mycroft, professor of computing at Cambridge University.\nFacebook as a result has developed a new language, Hack, to help keep types constant through large masses of code.\nBut it requires very speedy coding.\nNobody said IT was easy.\nGoogle's Go is in this category, as is Mozilla's Rust.\nDropbox - largely coded in Python- hired Python's creator Guido van Rossum three years ago.\nWe can see Microsoft's C# as an earlier example of industry-driven design.\nProgramming languages behave like ecosystems, says Professor Mycroft.\nNew small languages are constantly developed, then suddenly a large corporation will use one.\n\"There's no God-given right to why one language lives and one doesn't,\" he says.\nC first became popular because Unix, Linux, and Windows were written in it. Java became popular because it enabled easy animation (applets) on early web pages.\nProgress is meanwhile being made in languages particularly suited to machine learning.\nThese have made great bounds lately in visual recognition, and in solving CAPTCHAs - those irritating jumbles of hidden words you have to type in to a website to prove that you are not a robot.\nIn this family of languages, the program, not the programmer, comes up with the algorithms needed to address a problem.\nThe maths needed for this sort of inference has made great strides in the last three years, says Dr Frank Wood, from Oxford's Department of Engineering Science and creator of the probabilistic programming language ANGLICAN.\nAnother feature of tomorrow's programming workplace is that software projects will \"only ever become bigger\", says Oxford University's Professor Kroening.\nWith the adequately trained talent spread around the world, \"remote working will grow more pervasive\", says Sophia Drossopoulou, professor of programming languages at Imperial College London.\nShe points to her husband's company, with 70 people distributed over 10 countries.\nCrucial to this are laptops that are now powerful enough for useful development.\nAsher Glynn, a software architect in London, says he has teams working everywhere from Ukraine to Australia to Portugal.\n\"The thing that you do miss out is the face-to-face bonding,\" he says. \"But I think we'll develop new techniques for dealing with the individual's feeling of isolation.\"\nHe points to co-working locations. Skype and other forms of teleconferencing will become more important adds Brendan Quinn, a London-based technology consultant.\nWorldwide, the number of people working in programming is in the order of 15 million.\nThis number is not rising fast enough, even though the number of things to be programmed is.\nIndia produces roughly 100,000 computer science graduates annually. By comparison, Britain produces roughly a tenth of that.\nGood news for qualified programmers, less so for tech companies facing talent shortages.\n\"That's why we work with organisations like Code Club, Young Rewired State and Raspberry Pi to inspire young people to get involved with coding and digital technology,\" says Eileen Noughton, managing director of Google UK.\nPushing this even further, Vikas Gupta, an Amazon and Google veteran with a three and a half year-old daughter, co-founded the Wonder Workshop in Silicon Valley in 2012, to teach children to code.\nIn December 2014, it began shipping two robots - Dash and Dot.\nUsing music and drawing interfaces, the robots entice young children to develop coding skills, like ordering commands in a sequence, and working in subroutines.\nMaybe it is a little too keen to imagine an entire future generation of Raspberry-reared garage programmers. But they are likely to be in short supply.\nSo perhaps spare a thought for Steve Jobs beginning Apple in his parents' garage, before you convert yours to a spare bedroom for the au pair or the mother-in-law.", "summary": "It has been three years since the credit-card sized Raspberry Pi launched.", "id": "32743770", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into a TV and a keyboard.

The Celtic players would have been unaware of that fact - although plenty of the home fans were following events on the other side of the country - but they are alert enough to the pressure being applied by Derek McInnes's side.\nCeltic, the defending champions, are currently in pursuit of the league leaders. They were certainly quick to respond against Dundee, taking full advantage of the visitors sitting too deep and being wasteful in possession.\nThe latter issues riled Paul Hartley, but the Dundee manager would no doubt concede that they were in part a response to Celtic's attacking intent. Griffiths had already sent a free-kick into the side netting and another chance over before the home side scored.\nDundee often had 10 men behind the ball, but Celtic had the refinement of touch and imagination to break through the lines. They were well served on the flanks, too, and Brown's deft pass released Izaguirre down the left and his cross was expertly volleyed into the net by Rogic.\nThe Australian attacking midfielder grew into a commanding presence. Tall, rangy, powerful and with a delicate touch, he provided all the qualities that Celtic have missed while Stefan Johansen has suffered a dip in form. He might have scored again, but after a brilliant surging run he saw his shot pushed away by Bain, and the Dundee goalkeeper was also equal to another volley later in the first half.\nCeltic were comfortably in front long before then. Rogic turned provider two minutes after opening the scoring, crossing for Griffiths who took the ball on his chest, stepped past Gary Irvine then drilled a shot past Bain.\nHartley was infuriated on the touchline, mostly because his team was so deep. When they did have the ball, they tended to be ponderous, although Paul McGinn did manage a long run down the right that ended with him falling to the ground inside the area as Efe Ambrose challenged, but half-hearted penalty appeals were turned away by the referee Steven McLean.\nThe visitors could not devise a more effective game plan during the interval and it took just one minute of the second half for Rogic to deliver another shot on target, that Bain again saved. Torment continued for the visitors, and Izaguirre finished nearly from close range with his right foot after a one-two with Kris Commons sent him into the area.\nFor all that his defensive nous is questioned, Izaguirre can be irrepressible going forward and he struck again when a cross from his fellow full-back Saido Janko was deflected to the back post and into his path.\nOnly sentiment could disrupt Celtic's poise. When Callum McGregor was pulled back inside the area by a forlorn Irvine, the home fans shouted for Izaguirre to take the spot kick. He was handed the ball, but then wildly blazed it over the bar and spent he next few minutes of the game shaking his head in disbelief.\nNadir Ciftci thought he had finally broken his duck for Celtic near the end, but a foul was awarded on Bain just before Ciftci tucked the ball into the empty net from McGregor's free-kick. The Celtic fans booed the decision, but it was a minor complaint on a satisfying afternoon for the home fans at Celtic Park.\nCiftci also wasn't finished. Moments later, he crossed for Brown to clip the ball past Bain, and then the former Dundee United striker did grab a goal, latching on to a loose passback and poking the ball past Bain.\nThere was loud acclaim for the goal, and for the scoreline.\nMatch ends, Celtic 6, Dundee 0.\nSecond Half ends, Celtic 6, Dundee 0.\nAttempt missed.

Zouma's headed clearance landed at the feet of Ibraimi, whose sumptuous curling shot found the top corner of Cech's goal.\nAfter Costa blazed high and wide, Chelsea were given a huge let-off at the other end when Zahovic side-footed over the bar from three yards after a perfect cross from left-back Viler.\nWith 20 minutes remaining, the visitors were denied a penalty when Oscar appeared to be tripped by his fellow Brazilian Arghus.\nChelsea's sense of grievance was short-lived. From a Fabregas corner, Terry's downward header presented Matic with the simplest of tap-ins to equalise.\nAs the Blues pushed hard for a winner, Handanovic made superb saves to deny Hazard and Costa, who then had a goal ruled out for offside.\nBut Maribor stayed in the game and almost snatched it when Tavares slashed Jean-Philippe Mendy's square pass wide of goal.\nIn the 85th minute, the outstanding Hazard was tripped by Viler in the box, but Handanovic dived to his left to keep it out and secure a famous point.\nMatch ends, NK Maribor 1, Chelsea 1.\nSecond Half ends, NK Maribor 1, Chelsea 1.\nSubstitution, NK Maribor.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was the creator with a weaving run along the edge of the area before finding Monreal, who beat David De Gea at the near post with composure.\nThe lead lasted only four minutes, United replying with quality of their own as Di Maria's perfect delivery dropped between Arsenal's defenders to be met by the flying figure of Rooney, who directed a powerful header beyond Wojciech Szczesny.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDi Maria was looking much more comfortable, as well as dangerous, on the flank and he stole in behind Arsenal to get in a low effort that Szczesny blocked with his legs at the near post.\nVan Gaal made a double change at the interval, sending on Phil Jones and Michael Carrick for Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, but there was no instant cure for the uncertainty that had plagued United's defence.\nAnd it was in evidence again as Arsenal went back in front just after the hour. Antonio Valencia's back-pass sold De Gea short and Welbeck reacted quickly to nudge the loose ball around the keeper and roll it into the unguarded net.\nWelbeck received warm applause from large sections of United's support when he was replaced by Olivier Giroud. There were some jeers mixed in but he clearly remains a popular figure at Old Trafford.\nSeconds after that switch De Gea produced a miraculous piece of goalkeeping to keep United in contention, somehow clawing out Santi Cazorla's shot from Alexis Sanchez's cross.\nUnited's play, as well as the noise from their supporters, carried an air of desperation and their cause was not helped by a moment of madness from Di Maria that saw him sent off with 13 minutes left.\nIt was one of many lows on a night when the frustrations of United and their supporters bubbled to the surface - and their trophy hopes ended.\nMatch ends, Manchester United 1, Arsenal 2.\nSecond Half ends, Manchester United 1, Arsenal 2.\nCorner,  Arsenal.

I thought we deserved to win the game of football but you find yourself 1-0 down with 15 minutes to go so that is the harsh reality of it.\n\"The positives were we passed the ball well. But we never penetrated, we never tested their keeper and we didn't have enough bravery in the final third.\n\"All credit to Motherwell - they were very hard working, very well organised and well marshalled. Our goals came late because that is when their players tire. Again two late goals is credit to our team, to their fitness and their desire.\n\"It was two quality finishes, a great ball in from Waggy and then the composure and the poise from Kenny. The second is a great ball in from Emerson and he finishes it with aplomb so it is no coincidence. It is the way he [Miller] works on the training field, the way he eats.

uncontrollable shaking of the hands, head or body.\nIt is a neurological condition usually caused by faulty circuits in the thalamus, a small area at the base of the brain.\nIt can sometimes be treated with drugs, which can have serious side effects, or with brain surgery, but this carries the risk of stroke and infection.\nI first met Selwyn Lucas a week before his surgery, at Charing Cross hospital, when he attended his final assessment.\nHis right hand does not shake when it is at rest, but begins to vibrate uncontrollably when he goes to use it.\nEach time he tried to do something with his hand it began to shake.\nHe was asked to draw a spiral shape and as soon as he put pen to paper his right hand began juddering.\nThis is typical of the condition known as \"essential tremor\", which affects one in 25 adults over the age of 40.\nIt contrasts with the tremors in Parkinson's disease, which occur when the patient's hand or other affected limb is at rest.\nMr Lucas, who is a painter and decorator, said the tremors began nearly 20 years ago and have got progressively worse.\n\"I have to use my left hand when painting to do all the edging, otherwise I would end up with wiggly lines between the walls and ceiling,\" he said.\n\"My concern is that it might spread to my left hand.\"\nOn the morning of surgery, Mr Lucas arrived at St Mary's Hospital with a shaved head - necessary because hair could trap heat from the ultrasound and cause a burn.\nAfter another shave, to remove any remaining follicles, a metal frame was bolted to his scalp to ensure that his head remained completely still during treatment.\nHe was then led to the MRI suite and his head inserted in the ultrasound machine.\nHow it works\nThe machine uses high-intensity focused ultrasound to destroy the faulty electrical circuits in the brain which are causing the tremor.\nUltrasound is sound waves which are at higher frequencies than those audible to humans.\nAt low intensity, ultrasound is harmless, and widely used for health imaging, such as in pregnancy.\nBy contrast, the machine at St Mary's uses 1,024 high-intensity, focused ultrasound beams which target a precise point in the thalamus.\nBut how can sound waves perform surgery?\nAt high intensity, ultrasound waves cause molecules to vibrate, which generates energy and heat.\nWhen the beams are focused on a single point, this can ablate, or destroy, tissue by heating cells to near 60C until they die.\nProf Gedroyc said: \"One simple way to imagine this is to think of how a magnifying glass can be used to focus the sun's rays on a single point and burn a hole.\"\nThe procedure lasted around five hours and involved more than a dozen \"sonications\", each lasting several seconds.\nThese were calculated using the real-time brain scans of the MRI machine, which showed where the temperature hot spot was being targeted.\nAfter each sonication, the patient was asked to raise his right hand to check the tremor.\nHis neurologist, Dr Bain, also checked that his speech was not slurred, which would be a warning sign that the ultrasound was targeting the wrong part of the brain.\nDr Bain said there was little margin for error: \"It's like asking the RAF to blow up 10 Downing Street but leave 11 Downing Street in perfect shape - we have to be very careful because parts of the brain with vital functions are just nearby.\"\nThe result was remarkable - the tremors in Mr Lucas's right hand completely disappeared, and doctors hope this will be permanent.\nMr Lucas was also able to write his name for the first time in years.\nHis ability to draw a spiral also showed dramatic improvement.\nMr Lucas emerged from the scanner with no apparent ill-effects and a beaming smile.\nHe told me: \"I'm absolutely made-up. It's brilliant.  I'm looking forward to being able to carry a tray of drinks without worrying about dropping them.\"\nHis wife, Marianna, said she was thrilled for him.\n\"Selwyn used to get very frustrated and his condition did get him down from time to time, so this is wonderful.\"\nThe ultrasound machine, Exablate Neuro, is produced by Insightec, a technology firm based in Israel.\nThere are 24 of the machines worldwide, in the United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Spain, Italy, Israel, Switzerland, but this is the first in the UK.\nThe \u00c2\u00a31.1m cost was funded entirely by the  Imperial College Healthcare Charity.\nFocused ultrasound was approved for essential tremor by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States earlier this year.  It also has a CE mark in Europe.\nThe treatment at St Mary's is part of an international trial, which is now full, to further assess its safety and effectiveness.\nSo far, four patients have been treated and there are about 15 more who have been identified for the trial.\nThe results will form a crucial part of evidence to be submitted to NICE and NHS England on whether the procedure should be made widely available.\nThe cost of the treatment is \u00c2\u00a312,500 compared with \u00c2\u00a335,000 for brain surgery.\nDr Bain said deep brain stimulation, which involves drilling through the skull and implanting an electrode in the thalamus, carried a one-in-100 risk of stroke and one-in-1,000 risk of death. \"The balance of gain to risk is hugely altered by this treatment, and the patient can go home the same day,\" he said.\nNext year the same team at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust will take part in an international trial to treat motion disorders in Parkinson's disease.\nA different part of the brain will be targeted - one which is responsible for causing use bradykinesia, slowness of movement, which is a feature of Parkinson's.\nDr Bain said it could also be used to correct tremors from other neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, and might have wider applications.\n\"We could also potentially use it for activating chemicals inside the body which remain inert until you focus sound waves on them, and this could be invaluable in treating brain tumours.\"\nIf the procedure is approved it will require a significant reorganisation in the way hospitals treat patients with serious tremors.\nIt would free up time in operating theatres, which would be a major benefit.\nBut the MRI unit at St Mary's already runs at full capacity, so services would need to be reorganised in order to enable the ultrasound machine to get fully used.\nIt can take years for medical advances to be picked up by the NHS.\nThe radiology and neurology teams at Imperial College are hoping this is one innovation that will be rapidly adopted.\nFollow Fergus on Twitter", "summary": "Doctors in London have used sound waves to successfully operate deep inside the brain.", "id": "38157770", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe BBC was given exclusive access to the treatment, which was performed in the imaging department rather than operating theatres, and did not involve surgeons.\nThe treatment at St Mary's is part of an international trial, which is now full, to further assess its safety and effectiveness.\nThe cost of the treatment is \u00c2\u00a312,500 compared with \u00c2\u00a335,000 for brain surgery.\nDr Bain said", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe BBC's Fergus Walsh reports from the hospital in London where a man is having a brain operation to treat his tremors.\nThe BBC's Fergus Walsh reports from the hospital in London where a man is having a brain operation to treat his tremors.\nThe BBC's Fergus Walsh reports from the hospital in London where a man is having a brain operation to treat his tremors.\nThe BBC's Fergus Walsh", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe NHS is already using the ultrasound machine, which is a major benefit.\nThe ultrasound machine is already in use at Imperial College.\nThe ultrasound machine is already in use at Imperial College.\nThe ultrasound machine is already in use at Imperial College.\nThe ultrasound machine is already in use at Imperial College.\nThe ultrasound machine is already in use at Imperial College.\nThe ultrasound machine is already in use at", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nThe MRI machine is a very powerful tool, and the ultrasound machine is a very powerful tool.\nThe MRI machine is a very powerful tool, and the ultrasound machine is a very powerful tool.\nThe MRI machine is a very powerful tool, and the ultrasound machine is a very powerful tool.\nThe MRI machine is a very powerful tool, and the ultrasound machine is a very powerful tool.\nThe MRI machine is a very", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe man who had the treatment is called Selwyn Lucas.\nHe is 52 and from London.\nHe has a condition called essential tremor, which causes his right hand to shake uncontrollably.\nHe has had the condition for 20 years and it has got worse in the last five years.\nHe has tried medication, but it has not worked.\nHe has tried deep brain stimulation, but it has not worked.\nHe has", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nFergus Walsh is a BBC News technology correspondent.

a win as the manager gave youth a chance.\nIn a game which was meaningless in terms of league places, the gap between the clubs widened to nine points.\nSaints threatened to equalise after Graham Cummins pulled one back but the visitors clung on to take an end-of-season victory.\nThe visitors' line-up raised a few eyebrows pre-match as Caixinha made five changes.\nHe gave a debut to Jak Alnwick in goal and a first start to Jamie Barjonas in the middle of the park, while youngsters Aiden Wilson and David Bates retained their places in central defence.\nBut his reshuffle worked. Eventually.\nThe passing was sharp and crisp from both sides on a greasy surface heavily watered by the Perthshire rain, but we had to wait fully 21 minutes for any genuine threat of a goal.\nThat was from Liam Craig, a searing shot which had Alnwick panicking as it flew just over his crossbar.\nIt did set an example. Craig Thomson fizzed a low shot across the goal and at the other end Rangers finally threatened to bother Alan Mannus, but Miller blazed over to the frustration of 2,453 visiting fans in a crowd of 6,799.\nBut before half time - in the 40th minute to be precise - the veteran striker found his shooting boots. And it was a gem of a goal.\nMartyn Waghorn won himself space with a cute dummy and powered down the right, awaiting a presence in the box. Miller arrived with perfect timing and met the cross first time to deliver a low shot beyond Mannus for his 14th goal of the season.\nBut the quality of the goal camouflaged the inadequacies of the first half and the fact that in that 45 minutes St Johnstone were the better team.\nThat, however, changed after the break. Rangers went two ahead in the 53rd minute and again it was a classy goal.\nThe finish was a low first time shot from Toral but it was all about James Tavernier. The right wing back produced an incredible dancing, jinking run along the by-line - almost on it like a tightrope walker - and laid it on a plate for Toral.\nRangers looked to have a grip on the game and the three points and that was reflected with a growing confidence from their young centre-halves, who produced a pretty solid performance.\nBut they did slip up once before the end to allow substitute Cummins to blast home a shot from close in.\nAnd only a wonder save from Alnwick at point-blank range from MacLean denied Saints an equaliser.\nAt the other end Mannus produced something similarly wonderful to deny Barjonas his first goal for Rangers, who were worth their win.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"There was only one team in it the first 30-35 minutes. Overall we were probably the better side but that didn't equate to more goals than the opposition. From our point of view the second goal is far far too easy.\n\"The performance was good but the result wasn't what I think the performance merited.\"\nOn his summer plans: \"We need to get Danny (Swanson) replaced and get some fresh legs, a bit of pace up front.\n\"We're looking at where we'll really try to strengthen the squad and improve it. We need to do things quickly.\n\"I'm expecting to be here next season. I have two years left on my contract. I have a great job here and it would have to be the right move for me, because I have such a good club here and I'm happy here. I am ambitious and if something had to come along that ticks all the boxes, it may interest me.\"\nRangers manager Pedro Caixinha told Rangers TV: \"I was really enjoying watching the game. After 10 or 15 minutes, we understood what was going on. Jon [Toral] and Josh [Windass] coming inside together with Kenny [Miller] created a very good situation for us.\n\"We were able to keep the ball and we had options to play inside and on the wide area, and it was good. We were understanding the game and enjoying it.\n\"Now it is the end of the season and it is time to start taking the decisions. We are already going in that direction and in a few weeks' time we start again.\"\nMatch ends, St. Johnstone 1, Rangers 2.\nSecond Half ends, St. Johnstone 1, Rangers 2.\nAttempt missed.

18 days in post, public rows over how the party is run, and a bitter battle over its leadership in Wales.\nHow did a party which won nearly 4 million voters at the last election and triumphed in the EU referendum get into such an apparent mess and where does it go from here?\nThe bad blood which is currently being spilt in the party can largely be traced back to the 2015 general election and its aftermath.\nIt was all very different back in the winter of 2014. At that point, the party was carrying all before it, having topped the polls in the European elections and persuaded two Conservative MPs - Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless - to cross the floor and join it.\nAll the talk was of further defections from Conservative ranks and UKIP winning up to a dozen seats in the following year's election.\nOf course, none of this happened. UKIP surpassed expectations by getting nearly 4 million votes and 12.6% of the vote - an extraordinary performance by any measure.\nBut that only translated into one parliamentary seat while leader Nigel Farage, who had bestrode the party like a colossus for a decade, suffered personal disappointment by failing to get elected in Kent.\nMr Farage had vowed - many say unwisely - to stand aside if he wasn't elected to Parliament and he duly did so, naming rising star Suzanne Evans as his preferred interim successor.\nBut the party's ruling national executive committee refused to accept his resignation - arguing he had a key role to play in the forthcoming EU referendum - and within days his \"un-resignation\" was official.\nThis was a pivotal moment, with some grateful for the U-turn, others believing it tarnished Mr Farage's credibility and made the party look like a personality cult.\nWhat followed were weeks of briefing, counter-briefing and manoeuvring, in many ways a less vicious precursor of the current strife.\nThe wounds that were inflicted during this period of conflict have never really healed, despite the party seeing its dream ambition - the UK voting to leave the European Union - realised.\nThis summer's at-times farcical leadership contest and the events in Strasbourg involving Steven Woolfe and Mike Hookem all indicate a party that is going through something of an identity crisis.\nNot entirely, but in this case it is wrong to pretend the schisms in the party are solely or even fundamentally about politics or the party's future direction.\nLike a medieval court, personalities matter and the succession is the one issue that, above all, preoccupies the party.\nThis is a reflection of the success of Nigel Farage and the almost impossible task - like those who followed Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford - that anyone hoping to take over from him faces.\nUnder his leadership, the party has advanced from the fringes of British politics - when it was derided by opponents as being full of \"fruitcakes and loons\" - to the mainstream, setting the agenda on many issues and seeing its policies adopted by other parties.\nIn her resignation letter, Diane James suggested there were some in the party unwilling to accept her authority and move on and it is unclear whether whoever follows her will fare any better.\nAlthough one has to be careful not to generalise, there are, broadly speaking, two factions in the party and the animosity between them is real.\nOne group is aligned around Nigel Farage, many of whose members would ideally prefer him to continue as leader but, knowing that he wants out, are focused on ensuring his successor is cut from broadly the same cloth and will pursue the same leadership style.\nThey grouped around Steven Woolfe this summer and, when he was barred from standing after submitting his paperwork late, transferred their allegiance to Diane James.\nAmong the most vocal members of this group are the party's main financial backer Arron Banks, Raheem Kassam - Mr Farage's former chief-of-staff who is now standing to be leader - and the party's former leader in Wales Nathan Gill.\nOn the other side of the trenches are those who, while respecting Mr Farage's achievements, believe he has taken the party as far as he can and feel it is time for a more collegiate approach and more inclusive, less polarising message. In this camp, you will find Suzanne Evans, Douglas Carswell and former director of communications Patrick O'Flynn.\nThey rallied round councillor Lisa Duffy in this summer's campaign but found themselves comprehensively outgunned by the other wing of the party - with James winning 46% of the vote.\nMany UKIP-watchers believe the original contest should have been between Steven Woolfe and Suzanne Evans - who was suspended at the time - and this is what will play out this time around - assuming Mr Woolfe decides to continue after the trauma of recent days.\nNot all the party's 22 MEPs fit snugly into either of the two groups and there are some key figures - such as former deputy leader Paul Nuttall or new Welsh leader Neil Hamilton - who have their own power bases and - some would argue - axes to grind.\nAs is often the case with parties supposedly at war with each other, UKIP actually agree on an awful lot - leaving the EU as soon as possible, ending freedom of movement rules, slashing foreign aid, expanding selective education, less military intervention abroad and so on...\nThere is broad agreement that the party needs to become more professional, more disciplined and overhaul the way it makes decisions - including scrapping the NEC to reduce the power of voluntary members.\nThere is also consensus, in the post-referendum age and with David Cameron gone, that UKIP's electoral future - aside from a few Tory-held seats in the east of England - lies in going after \"soft\" Labour territory in parts of the Midlands, Yorkshire and the north-east of England.\nThese are all areas where UKIP did well last year, where there was a large Leave vote in the referendum and where, so the conventional wisdom goes, people are not warming to Jeremy Corbyn and his more liberal message on immigration and other issues.\nWhile its long-term ambition is not in doubt - becoming the official opposition in England - it is how it gets there and the tone it adopts in doing so which really divides those vying to shape its future.\nUKIP has come a long way in 20 years and it would be easy to dismiss its current problems as growing pains - were they not clearly more serious than that.\nThe party got where it is by cultivating a mixture of populism, nationalism and euroscepticism - with disdain for the global establishment and an outsider, underdog status thrown in for good measure.\nIt has mopped up protest votes in the past five years but, as the Lib Dems know to their cost, an insurgent party cannot take anything beyond its core vote for granted.\nIt is an open question how UKIP reacts to Theresa May's leadership and her apparent intention to colonise its ground on issues like immigration but also to appeal to Labour voters on the economy and public services.\nShould UKIP try to outflank the Tories in working class seats in the north of England - where they are still treated with suspicion by many - or persist with a more traditional conservative, low-tax, small-state message?\nShould it be copying the so-called post-ideological approach of the Five Star Movement in Italy - something Nigel Farage is reported to be keen on - or ape the blue-collar, culture war approach that has underpinned Donald Trump's unconventional tilt at the White House?\nWhile the UK is still a member of the EU and the risk of a \"soft Brexit\" remains, UKIP has a single, over-arching issue that it can unite around.\nIf and when that is no longer the case, the party's ideological moorings may seem less secure and the search for a new purpose and direction is clearly at the heart of the current tribulations.", "summary": "The fracas between two UKIP members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, which ended up with one of them being hospitalised, is the latest in a series of PR disasters for the party,", "id": "37584412", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nUKIP is a party in crisis.\nUKIP is a party in transition.\nUKIP is a party in turmoil.\nUKIP is a party in transition.

There were a number of protests by different supporter groups who felt this was the thin end of the wedge and that by allowing in Premier League under-21 sides, it was the start of allowing them into the league structure.\"\nSS: There have been low crowds - 392 at Fleetwood v Blackburn, 460 at AFC Wimbledon, 585 at Accrington. Is that the competition or the debate around it?\nSH: \"It is the misconception this competition was being utilised to bring B teams into the Football League. There are more games, but more than 42,000 attended the opening games compared to 29,000 last year. The numbers at some of them were far lower than we would have liked. But the time to judge the competition is not now. It is at the end, to see how many of the objectives we set for it have been met. We wanted to create the opportunity for younger players at Category One academy clubs, and, indeed, our clubs, to gain valuable experience in senior football. The second was to reinvigorate a competition some clubs, historically, were against existing at all. It was becoming stale because the format had been the same for many years. The third objective was that, in making the changes, we have been able to increase prize money to \u00a31.95m.\"\nSS: I attended a game at Bolton. Fans there said there was a potential problem if a Premier League team reached the final. They have realistic opportunities to get to Wembley in the FA Cup and League Cup. This is supposed to be a competition for League One and League Two teams. Their only realistic chance of getting to Wembley is through the Checkatrade Trophy.\nSH: \"Remember, the entry requirement for invited clubs is there must be six players in the starting line-up under the age of 21. If those players progress, the development element of our objectives - creating opportunities for younger players to play in senior competition - would be vindicated. League One and Two clubs won 28 out of 32 games in the first round of matches. It should be possible for an invited club to get to Wembley because it is a real competition and not just another raft of friendly fixtures. Unless there is a real prize at the end of each game, nobody feels it replicates professional football fully.\"\nSS: Would giving the winners of the Checkatrade Trophy entry into the second round of the League Cup be a better way of reinvigorating the tournament?\nSH: \"There are always ways to innovate using the League One and League Two clubs. We have committed at the end of this one-year pilot to review that with our clubs. But we won't be counting anything in or out. That is what we are asking everyone else to do. To keep an open mind to see whether the objectives we have set for this competition are working.\"\nSS: Everton coach David Unsworth thought the new format provided a fantastic experience for his young players to play in a proper stadium, in a competitive environment, in a competition that meant something. Some Bolton fans didn't see the value of it. They wondered why the Football League was doing the Premier League's \"dirty work\". They felt the Premier League, with all its money, should be sorting out its own mess because it is those clubs who develop players who go on to the England team.\nSH: \"We take a more holistic view. English football, collectively, needs to try to find solutions to problems facing the whole game, not just one section of it. David Unsworth's comments are ones we would expect to hear from clubs who see this as a real opportunity to try and bridge the gap, which we all acknowledge is there, between academy and professional football. I don't accept we are doing the Premier League's dirty work.\"\nSS: The 392 at Fleetwood might have been watching Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham or Liverpool had they decided to compete. Chelsea are there but you are without five of the six biggest teams in this country who, by definition, would have the best young players. I understand why those clubs didn't want to compete, because it clashed with international games and they felt it wouldn't be appropriate for a sub-standard side to compete in their name. But without those five clubs, the whole concept is undermined fatally isn't it?\nSH: \"Only if someone has a crystal ball and can tell us where the next best young players are coming from. The big clubs all appreciated what we were trying to achieve. We were shoe-horned into those dates by the overcrowded fixture list and the requirement to play in the midweek of international football. It is a big leap to say the international players and Premier League stars of the future would only come from the top five clubs.\"\nSS: I didn't say they would only come from those clubs. I said they would predominantly come from them.\nSH: \"Well they aren't at this moment in time, and they don't historically. The majority of younger players in the England team have had experience at an EFL club in one form or another. We are providing an opportunity. We fully understand why the big clubs did not want to compete. Yes, it would have been better to have all the big clubs involved. But we are certainly not crying over that particular element because the EFL and its clubs are doing all they can to help. We believe 14 of the England squad at Euro 2016 came through EFL academies. In a squad of 23, it suggests that whilst the better players may end up at the bigger clubs, the training and development is going on up and down the country. The majority of team that takes the field, hopefully, in the opening game of the Qatar 2022 World Cup may well, at this moment in time, be at EFL clubs.\"\nKnow someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them.\nSS: Those five big names would presumably add more to attendances. Would you look at altering the structure of the competition so matches could be played at different times to allow them to compete?\nSH: \"By choice we would want to make the competition flexible, so as many clubs as possible could take part. However, we are well and truly fixed inside a schedule. As much as we are supportive of the Checkatrade Trophy centrally, it is never going to be more important than the league games. They have to take priority. It may be that we are trying to do too many in total. However, that should not be an excuse for not trying.\"\nSS: Barnsley played Oxford in last season's final. It was a fantastic day for those two clubs. There were 59,230 supporters there and it generated a lot of revenue. How would you feel if Chelsea played Everton in this season's final?\nSH: \"If we end up with two-non EFL clubs in the final, I suspect it will be disappointing for the 48 clubs in League One and League Two. The same question is not always asked of the Football Association, whether they would be disappointed if two teams from the EFL got to the FA Cup final. I suspect they would support it in exactly the same way. Competitive football means winning teams get through to the final. If we end up with two invited clubs in the final, rather than two of our own, the chances of the pilot continuing beyond this year in this format would probably be slim.

His shot was straight at the United 'keeper, but inexplicably he allowed the ball to slip through his hands and into the net.\nIt was a dreadful mistake and a blow to a United side who were already lacking in confidence with only one win in their opening eight matches.\nSlowly the home side crept into the game and Fraser and Charlie Telfer came close to an equaliser, before it eventually came from former Dunfermline defender Morris.\nThe Pars makeshift defence failed to clear a corner and Morris found space inside the six yard box to head home.\nWallace missed a glorious chance on the stroke of half time that would have put Dunfermline in front when he slipped the ball beyond the far post with the goal gaping.\nThe winger made a terrific run that beat the United offside trap. He took the ball around the keeper but with an open goal facing him he slipped the ball the wrong side of the far post.\nUnited manager McNamara may well have had some strong words for his players and they certainly started the second period with a flourish.\nBilly McKay and substitute Spittal both came close for the home side before Dunfermline goalkeeper Sean Murdoch pulled off a succession of saves to keep his side in the game.\nDunfermline also had their chances as El-Bahktoui curled the ball just wide of goal after Michael Moffat had his chance blocked.\nWith the last attack of the 90 minutes United were denied again when Murdoch saved from Simon Murray as the former Arbroath striker looked set to score with a header.\nThe home side eventually took the lead in extra-time thanks to a wonderful solo effort.\nFraser evaded the challenge of four Dunfermline defenders before guiding the ball beyond the helpless Murdoch and at last the home fans could breathe easy.\nAnd the tie was put to bed when Spittal cut in from the left hand side before curling a left foot shot into the corner to send United into the next round.\nDundee United manager Jackie McNamara: \"The important thing is we're in the next round.\n\"As you would expect we were nervous at the start but we grew into it.\n\"I thought Dunfermline started the game better than us.

But how far do the new measures go, who is monitoring them and what reassurance do they really offer?\nIn a long metal shed, hundreds of light brown mink dart around within rows of wire cages. It's really quiet - only the occasional squeak can be heard.\nThe fate of these animals is ultimately the same as any other farmed mink. At six months old, they will be gassed and their pelts sent to auction.\nBut for now, these ones are being studied by researchers working on new animal welfare assessments for the fur industry.\nThe mink are kept at a fur farm belonging to Aarhus University in Denmark.  The senior scientist, Steen Moller, showed me around one of the sheds.\n\"Like all other farm animals, they are kept in a confined space, so what we need to investigate is how do we provide the best environment for them,\" he says.\nThe cages contain shelves, straw and \"toys\" (plastic tubes), which are enrichments required by Danish law. Legal requirements vary from country to country, but Mr Moller is working on a common set of welfare assessment measures which can be applied to all European fur farms that sign up to be inspected.\n\"Basically, a farm will have three visits in one year in order to get an assessment,\" he says.\n\"If they have all of the provisions for the animals in terms of cages and enrichments and they feed them well and take care of them well, then they will get a good score. Any farm starts with score zero and then they get scores for everything they do. The best score they can get is 100, but I don't think anyone will get 100.\"\nThe \"Welfur\" assessments, as they are known, will look at housing and management conditions, but also observe how the animals themselves seem to be doing.\nOne of the tests involves putting a stick through the bars of the cage. Inquisitive mink that approach it are seen as well adjusted. Any that back off and appear fearful are considered likely to be living in stress.\nIn another room, a specially adapted cage includes a nest box, food, a running wheel and swimming water. Pressing the right lever allows access to each of these resources. Observing how often mink are prepared to press each lever to access different parts of the cage is used to measure the animal's preferences.\n\"They are quite good learners, says Mr Moller's colleague, Jens Malmkvist, \"so in that way, we can say we ask the animal what they want instead of what we think they want.\n\"The nest box - they want to work for this permanently. They will work for access to swimming water and they will work for access to a running wheel - however, on a low level, so maybe this is more like a luxury thing. It is a 'nice to have' rather than a 'need to have'.\"\nThose conclusions, based on various scientific studies, might seem rather convenient for the fur industry. Nest boxes are already attached to cages on mink farms. Adding running wheels or access to swimming water would be harder and more costly.\n\"We have done a lot of studies on other things that are easier to give them, like permanent access to straw or a shelf or something to play with,\" says Mr Malmkvist.\n\"The resources in the cage do matter for them, so we don't decide what they should have, but we try to provide some knowledge - if you have to enrich the cages, which things should you do first?\n\"And then, swimming water is not in the front line. It would be enriching for mink probably, but it's not the first thing to do if you have to invest in cages.\"\nFarms which have resources that mink appear to value most in scientific studies will score well under the \"Welfur\" scheme. Lesser scores are given for enrichments that are not so highly valued or are considered unproven.\nThe new welfare inspections are due to start in January 2017. They will cover the three main fur animal species farmed in Europe - the mink, the blue fox and the silver fox.\nFur Europe - the trade association behind the scheme - says an independent company is being used to conduct the checks.\nFarmers will have to pay towards the cost of their assessments, but taking part is voluntary.\n\"It is voluntary, yes, but to which extent, you can discuss,\" says Mette Lykke Hansen, Fur Europe's chief executive.\n\"We have had a statement from the European auction houses saying that from 2020, they will not sell skins that are not Welfur certified, so if you are not in the system, it will be very difficult to sell your skins from 2020 and onwards.\"\nIf any farm that opts for an assessment fails to reach an acceptable welfare score, it will also be unable to sell its furs at European auction houses, according to Fur Europe.\nIt does not intend to publish each farm's score - individual farmers can choose to do that if they wish. Instead, it says it will publish only aggregated data, possibly for each country.\nThe fur farmer Ceslovas Tallat-Kelpsa does plan to sign up. He keeps more than 200,000 mink on his farms in Lithuania. He thinks it will improve animal welfare standards and make European furs more competitive, boosting the price he is paid for his pelts.\n\"I believe it will increase,\" he says. \"Buyers want to buy certificated fur.\"\nHe told me that in 2015, the price paid per pelt barely covered his production costs. He received an average of \u20ac30 (\u00a326) for each one, when previously he had been paid about \u20ac70 (\u00a361) on average.\nThe fur industry is keen to convince people it is doing all it can to look after the animals in its care, but its Welfur scheme does not convince everyone.\n\"I have come to the conclusion that it is very little more than a PR lobbying tool to try and defend the fur industry, mostly within the European Union,\" says Mark Glover from Respect for Animals, which campaigns against the international fur trade.\n\"The criteria are economic. A mink cage, for instance, will never be longer than a person's arm, for obvious reasons of catching and handling the mink.\n\"They are incapable of making conditions anywhere near acceptable for the animal welfare of the mink and that is where we disagree with them entirely. Fur is an abhorrent product and the sooner it is banned, the better.\"\nFur farming was banned in England and Wales by the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000. At the time, there were 13 fur farms in England and none in Wales. Similar bans followed in other parts of the UK. The import and sale of fur skins and products is permitted.\nMink is the animal most commonly bred for its fur in Europe, where the biggest producer is Denmark.

At 17, he was being put forward as a reason to bring in a minimum age limit for drivers entering F1.\nThere were question marks about him, and the morality and wisdom of having such a young driver with such limited experience.\nA year on from that, those questions marks are long gone, and Dutchman Verstappen is regarded as the revelation of the season - and his performances have put more focus on youth coming through.\nBeyond that, people are talking about him as a future world champion.\nThe first thing that impresses about Verstappen are his overtaking manoeuvres. A number stand out:\nThere have been a couple of defining characteristics about all those moves.\nFirstly, they have all been very close, but none of them went wrong. Verstappen has excellent spatial awareness; a very good feel for the extremities of his car and his rivals.\nAnd secondly, they are all under control - there are no locked wheels or overshot corners, despite being very much on the limit. He has great sensitivity for how deep he can brake into a corner and where the limit is, which I have not seen very often before.\nIt's impossible to make a definitive judgment on Verstappen's pace, because the only person we can directly compare him to is his team-mate Carlos Sainz, who is also a rookie.\nHowever, what we can say is that, in his rookie year, Verstappen has qualified 11 times in the top 10, including sixth in his second race.\nAnd he has finished in the top 10 in five of the last six races.\nIt's also worth mentioning in that context that the Toro Rosso has not developed as much through the year as some of the cars around it.\nIts qualifying margin to Mercedes has stayed basically the same, whereas Force India, for example, have moved forward.\nAnother stand-out aspect of Verstappen's season has been the lack of ups and downs, which you expect of any driver, and especially one in his first season.\nBeyond his basic ability, Verstappen seems to be mentally very tough as well. You can see that in the way he deals with his new-found celebrity - and the way earlier this season he made his feelings known about his belief that Sainz was getting more of the rub of the green on strategies.\nIntentionally or not, if anything Toro Rosso's focus has now gone in the other direction, towards Verstappen.\nHis mental strength was also seen when he refused to accede to a team order to let Sainz by in Singapore.\nIf that sounds tough, it is. But it is one of the many character traits that makes the difference between ordinary drivers and special ones.\nNone of the people who have won world championships have done it by being pussycats.\nDespite that, Verstappen is also quite light-hearted.\nI ran the circuit on Saturday night in Brazil and at the start of my second lap, Verstappen was standing by his pit board, preparing it for his engineer, who was also running the circuit.\nThat sort of light-hearted, youthful enthusiasm for life is a complete contrast to the hard-nosed ambition we see in the cockpit.\nVerstappen has made only one major mistake this year, and that was when he crashed into Lotus's Romain Grosjean in Monaco.\nIt was a misjudgement and a step too far - and it was not a good idea not to admit it was his mistake, and to try to blame Grosjean.\nI'm sure that was partly to do with his self-belief, but also because it was such a surprise. So it was probably a bit of a shock to the system - it was also a huge shunt.\nStill, he would not be the first driver who was reluctant to admit his mistakes. Michael Schumacher made a career of it.\nImpressively, though, Verstappen has recovered from it and gone from strength to strength.\nAs the season has gone on, Verstappen has overshadowed team-mate Carlos Sainz - the Dutchman is now 12th in the championship with 49 points and the Spaniard is 15th, with 18.\nThat's a huge gap, but it is not properly representative of their relative performances.\nSainz is 21 and has more experience in car racing than Verstappen. I know his dad, the rally legend of the same name, and I have watched young Carlos ever since he came into racing.\nHe has always impressed me and has continued to do so this year.\nYou have to bear in mind that Sainz very nearly did not have a seat in F1 this year. Red Bull had already promoted Verstappen, but the initial idea was that the teenager would be team-mate to Daniil Kvyat at sister team Toro Rosso.\nIt was only when Sebastian Vettel told Red Bull at last year's Japanese Grand Prix that he was moving to Ferrari that a seat opened up for Sainz, when Kvyat was moved up to the senior team to partner Daniel Ricciardo.\nEven then, it was only after a late test that they decided finally to give the seat to Sainz.\nDespite that, Sainz was arguably the more impressive in the first half of the season - he out-qualified and out-raced Verstappen most of the time.\nUndoubtedly, the second half of the season has not been as good for Sainz, but they are still tied nine-all on qualifying and Sainz has the highest qualifying position all year, with fifth in Spain.\nOn pure speed, it favours Verstappen by about 0.15secs if you average out all their laps, but in a team with reliability problems like Toro Rosso I am always reluctant to take that as a definitive comparison as the facts can be distorted too easily.\nOn top of that, Sainz has definitely had the worse run on reliability and has had seven non-finishes, four of them in the mid-season.\nBut Sainz has continued to impress - just look at his race in the USA.\nHe started from the pit lane and despite being stuck on medium tyres on a damp-but-drying track - when the softs would have been more suitable - he still finished seventh.\nHe was every bit as fast as Verstappen and Sainz's performance in Austin was as impressive as his team-mate's fourth place.\nSainz also showed great tenacity in racing the next day after the huge shunt he had in practice in Russia.\nIt was his first big accident, and that is always a tester for a driver - there is no certainty they will be unaffected by it. But the next day he was up to seventh place when he had to retire with failed brakes.\nSainz is smooth and consistent and makes no mistakes in races, whereas Verstappen has made a couple of high-profile errors.\nOverall, Sainz may not have produced the box-office excitement of Verstappen, but the performances have been much more impressive than the results are at face value.\nNext year will be a big test for both. The first year in F1 is a honeymoon period. But next year expectations will be higher for both and the focus will be more intense.\nThe Red Bull driver programme was coming in for criticism a few years ago, but there is no doubt it has now produced some current and potential stars.\nA couple of years ago, it seemed Sebastian Vettel was the only really top driver it had produced. But now all four of the Red Bull drivers in F1 have come through it, and they all look pretty special.\nAnd there is also Sebastien Buemi, still the lead team's reserve driver, who won the World Endurance Championship last year.\nThere is a downside to that, though - Toro Rosso drivers tend to get two years each. But with Kvyat and Ricciardo impressing at Red Bull and both Verstappen and Sainz looking good at Toro Rosso, that is going to give Red Bull some headaches next year.\nUnless one of them moves elsewhere, there is a logjam there, especially if they want to bring in another new driver.\nIt will be interesting to see how Red Bull handle that.\nAllan McNish was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson", "summary": "Max Verstappen has been one of the stars of the Formula 1 season.", "id": "34871338", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nVerstappen is a rookie, but he has already shown he is a star.\nVerstappen is a rookie, but he has already shown he is a star.

Now it could even influence government policy.\n\"It was a very small project but it has turned into an epic story,\" said Catrina McHugh, the co-founder and playwright of Open Clasp.\nOriginally a small commission from Dilly Arts in 2014 with modest ambitions, the brief was to work with women in Durham's Low Newton Prison, to write and produce a play, perform that play to male prisoners, and do one public show.\nBut the tiny production soon grew wings, took flight and soared high above the razor wire.\nThis week it starts a national tour of 16 venues, and even includes a special performance for MPs and policymakers at the Houses of Parliament.\nBut it started with a single character, Lucy, dreamed up by women taking part in a prison workshop.\n\"We asked the women what they wanted to say to a captive audience of men,\" explained McHugh.\n\"We started to explore who Lucy was, and the women pulled on their own experiences to make that character, like getting kicked out of home at 16, getting pregnant, losing children, having post-natal depression, experiencing domestic violence, and somewhere in that was childhood sexual abuse.\n\"But then there came a point in the workshops where that character wasn't holding all of the women, it didn't represent the women who'd had a heroin addiction prior to coming to prison, so a new character was created, Angie.\"\nMcHugh is originally from Liverpool but \"fell in love with a Geordie\" and moved to north-east England where she set up Open Clasp in 1998. As well as prisoners, the company has previously worked with the homeless, the elderly, and those affected by sexual violence.\nIn Key Change, Angie and Lucy share a stage with Kelly and the older Kim. Alternating between past and present, the audiences learn about their lives before prison and behind bars. They tackle several roles, playing abusive parents and partners and terrified children, among others.\n\"As a playwright it was my job was to listen to everything that had been said, the characters they had created, and then create a script which held that story,\" McHugh explained.\nAfter developing the play at Low Newton, the all-female cast and crew took it for a week-long tour in male prisons, It was, McHugh said, \"like Alcatraz\", all cloying life sentences and concrete walls.\n\"It is something I'll never forget,\" she said.\n\"We look at hard things, but Key Change is beautiful, and it's funny. And you have a captive audience of 100 men thinking 'I don't know why I am sitting here', then they see this piece of theatre and it moves them.\"\nActress Jessica Johnson, who plays the drug-addicted serial offender Angie, said she had found taking the women's stories of domestic abuse and post-natal depression inside the men's prison walls to be a \"very moving\" experience.\n\"In one of the prisons, one of the men - and there is a scene featuring domestic violence - said afterwards 'I see myself\u2026 I see myself there, that's what I do.'  It's that power of theatre where you are one removed, and you can look in on a situation and it changes your perception of things. \"\nMcHugh added: \"We shared with the women how the men had responded and they knew then they were part of something that absolutely was going to change things, but none of us knew how far that reach was going to go.\n\"We had no idea that we had a hit on our hands, that we had this gem, until we went to Live Theatre and had a sell-out performance. They came in the doors and said: 'Oh my God, this is amazing!'\n\"We knew then it needed need to go further afield, which is why we ended up in Edinburgh.\n\"And It just snowballed from there. We had an audience of 40, then 50, 60, then by the end of it we were sold out. Then we got the phone call from America saying we had been shortlisted for an award and if we won it we would be going to Broadway for three weeks.\"\nThe accolade was the prestigious Carol Tambor Award, which is given annually at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to a play which receives a four- or five-star review in The Scotsman newspaper. Open Clasp won, and Key Change enjoyed rave reviews during their New York run earlier this year.\nJohnson said the theatre group was \"gobsmacked\" to win.\n\"We went to the awards ceremony in costume, and we had to jump straight in a taxi to the theatre and we were on stage straightaway. That was a really energised show! What we've always kept in mind is that Key Change is about the women's voices, and it was the excitement of carrying those voices all the way to New York.\"\nBut the bright lights of Broadway did not dazzle. Just as they had in Scotland, the women took their show into a local women's prison, this time York Correctional Institute in Connecticut.\n\"The story is international, whether it is women in prison in New York, or in prison here,\" explained Johnson. \"The same issues exist, The response in York prison was amazing. We had women shouting 'Amen!' and 'Respect!' and we got a standing ovation.\"\nMcHugh said the prison performance was an important part of the process while they were in the US.\n\"It grounded us and connected us back to the women at Low Newton. And being inside that prison, knowing that this was connecting all of those women and feeling their voices are being heard across the world, was empowering.\"\nOpen Clasp will perform at the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday in front of more than 50 MPs and key policymakers, before continuing its national tour.\nIt is part of a campaign for alternative sentences for women who commit non-violent crimes backed by the Prison Reform Trust, rehabilitation charity Clinks and the National Criminal Justice Arts Alliance.\nThe play, McHugh explained, \"showcases\" the arguments for non-custodial punishments in a unique and effective way.\n\"Key Change tells you this is what life is like before prison and this is why we need to consider alternatives for women,\" she said. \"This is why we need to make sure we fund women's services. Support with housing, domestic violence, and having their aspirations supported.\n\"What the theatre can do is create empathy. It enables the audience to step into the shoes of the women they have seen on stage and walk in them, and see it from their point of view, and feel, and think, and consider, rather than them have a stereotype in their head. You think: 'OK, this is why we need to think differently.'\n\"We've always felt our job is to make change happen personally, politically, and socially, but to be sitting there in the House of Parliament and be contributing at that level to alternatives for women to prison is hard to put into words.\n\"We really are changing the world one play at a time because look, here we are, right at the top.\"\n\u202224-26 October: Battersea Arts Centre\n\u202228 October: Gala Theatre, Durham\n\u202231 October: The Bay Theatre, Weymouth\n\u20223 November: The Quarry Theatre, Bedford\n\u20229

blast home.\nSteven Defour, on his Burnley debut, was allowed to charge forward and set up Gray to roll home the second.\nLiverpool had 81% of possession and 26 shots - but only tested Clarets keeper Tom Heaton with efforts from distance.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe 19% of possession that the Clarets had is the lowest total by a winning side in the Premier League since Opta began recording the statistic in the 2003-04 season.\nBurnley only had one other effort at goal, which was off target, but the figures belied how little threat the Reds posed when they came forward.\nLiverpool were a shadow of the attacking force they were in last week's thrilling 4-3 win at Arsenal and their second away game of the season ended in their first defeat of the new campaign.\nThe game had been switched to Turf Moor because work on the new stand at Anfield is not complete and, after losing to Swansea in their opener, Burnley made home advantage count this time to pick up their first points since their promotion.\nThe manner of their victory at Emirates Stadium had given Liverpool plenty of reasons for early season optimism but, unfortunately for them, the only part of that performance they repeated came at the back.\nLeft-back Alberto Moreno paid the price for his defensive errors at the Emirates, being replaced by James Milner, but right-back Clyne produced an even worse error that led to Burnley's opener.\nRagnar Klavan also should have done better when he failed to stop Defour's run forward, leaving Liverpool's defence wide open for Gray to make it 2-0.\nThe Reds had problems at the other end too. Philippe Coutinho starred as Liverpool's forward play gave them victory last week - but he was a long way short of his best on this occasion.\nTime and time again the Brazilian picked up the ball in space on the edge of the Burnley area looking to bend in one of his trademark spectacular goals but, of his 10 strikes from similar range, only one brought a save from Tom Heaton.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told Match of the Day: \"Our decision making was not good. We'd put in a good cross but there were no bodies in the box and then when we had bodies in the box we ended up shooting.\n\"The season is still pretty young. It doesn't look like we are 100% fine-tuned. But it's only the start of the season and I can see a lot of good things.\n\"The lesson here is don't give the ball away like we did twice today. We will work on it 100%. We need to have a plan for deep defending teams. We have a few things to do - that is clear.\"\nAs poor as Liverpool were given their amount of possession, credit must also go to Burnley for the work-rate throughout their team as well as their organisation and resolve at the back.\nThe Clarets out-ran Liverpool by 115.3km to 113km - and that industry was key to them defending their lead and securing the points.\nWhen Liverpool did put balls into the box, Michael Keane and Ben Mee dealt with everything that came their way, ensuring Heaton was rarely tested.\nHis best save came from Roberto Firmino in the second half but, typically, that came from a long-distance shot.\nBurnley's strikers also deserve praise, with Vokes and Gray both able to celebrate the first top-flight goals of their career.\nThey barely had a kick for much of the game, but kept running and kept stretching Liverpool's defenders when Burnley were able to counter-attack.\n\"I thought we made Liverpool look uncomfortable,\" Burnley boss Sean Dyche told Match of the Day. \"We think we can be a threat to teams.\n\"We have never been bogged down with all the stats about possession. There is something marvellous when you see someone give everything to the cause. That's what I thought we did.\"\nLiverpool's road trip continues, first with a journey to Burton in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, and then a tough-looking task at Tottenham in the Premier League next weekend.\nBurnley are also on their travels.

Their performance in Lille was arguably the most dominant by a team at this championship.\nAfter three average group displays, this was more trademark Low. The 56-year-old is a coach who does not believe in rigid roles, and against Slovakia the movement of his attack stretched the opposition defence.\nGermany started in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Draxler on the left, Ozil in middle and Thomas Muller on the right of the attack, just behind striker Gomez.\nBut Draxler often interchanged with Ozil, and Muller spread himself about the Slovak half.\nJan Kozak's side spent the match chasing the Germans, and the game, after Bayern Munich's Boateng rifled in the first with a brilliant piece of opportunism.\nThey should have made it 2-0 but Ozil's tame spot-kick was easily saved by Matus Kozacik, after Gomez had been fouled by Martin Skrtel.\nThat miss did not knock the Germans off their stride, however, as the excellent Draxler teased Kucka down the left before finding Gomez, who scored his second of the tournament.\nAnd despite playing at a lower tempo after the break, Germany still managed to score a third when Draxler placed a near-post volley high past Kozacik.\nAlthough Draxler is only 22, he has been deemed as one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe since his 2011-12 breakthrough season at Schalke.\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2013, he spoke about improving his game without the ball, and now in 2016 the Wolfsburg player is almost the finished product.\nHis runs allowed Toni Kroos and Ozil to find space and influence the attack. And his final ball has also improved, as demonstrated when he set up Gomez for the second goal. The well-taken volley in the 63rd minute was deserved reward for an impressive performance.\nHaving played a peripheral role at the 2014 World Cup, he is now a major part of Low's side.\nDraxler on his display: \"I am happy that I put in a good performance today and that I was able to help the team.\n\"It is hard for me to say if this was my best or second-best game in a Germany shirt. Others can judge that better.\n\"We have a very capable side. So it's no problem if you are not playing in one game or the other. I tried not to let it get to me and to show in training that the coach could count on me.\n\"In the team talk the coach told me to look for one-on-ones. He has given me a lot of confidence and made it clear to me that I am a good player.\"\nSlovakia goalkeeper Matus Kozacik: \"We feel sorry because, from the beginning, the Germans dominated. We did not make them suffer at all. It is a pity.\n\"Perhaps after we defeated them in the [pre-Euros friendly], they prepared better. They played in a disciplined way and showed their greatness.\n\"If Kucka could have scored, we might have done something but their second goal was decisive.\n\"We have achieved a lot, I am very happy I could be here.

United should have every confidence of progressing from their first European semi in six years.\nCelta did have chances - both Daniel Wass and former Liverpool player Iago Aspas headed wide when they should have done better, while Pione Sisto's deflected shot forced Sergio Romero to save in the second half.\nBut United's front three of Rashford, Lingard and Mkhitaryan were more lively, while Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini dominated midfield.\nThis was United's 58th game of a season that promises six more matches if they make it to Stockholm.\nWhen Eric Bailly limped off in the draw against Swansea on Sunday, Mourinho's squad looked to be further stretched, especially at the back. Luke Shaw had already been injured in that game, while Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were on the sidelines.\nHowever, Bailly was fit enough to start in Spain, alongside midfielder Pogba, who has recovered from a muscle strain.\nCentre-back Smalling, who had not played for United since 19 March because of a knee injury, was on the bench.\nStill, it was not all positive news for Mourinho. Ashley Young, himself a substitute, lasted only 11 minutes before suffering what appeared to a hamstring problem, paving the way for Smalling's return.\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"I am very pleased with the performance but not with the result. At half-time we should have had three - or at least two goals.\n\"We played well enough to have the tie closed, but we have to go and play at Old Trafford.\n\"Rashford is a 19-year-old kid who is in love with football. He stays after training for half an hour to practise taking free-kicks and waits for the opportunity.\n\"We tried to win the match but we missed chances. We played well, we were compact against a team who are difficult to play against.\n\"Let's hope Old Trafford wants us to win because when Old Trafford wants it, we win.\"\nUnited's hectic schedule continues with a Premier League trip to Arsenal at 16:00 BST on Sunday, while Celta have a domestic date at Malaga on the same day.\nThe return leg is at Old Trafford next Thursday (20:05 BST kick-off).\nMatch ends, Celta de Vigo 0, Manchester United 1.\nSecond Half ends, Celta de Vigo 0, Manchester United 1.\nIago Aspas (Celta de Vigo) wins a free kick on the left wing.\nFoul by Antonio Valencia (Manchester United).\nFoul by Jonny (Celta de Vigo).\nJesse Lingard (Manchester United) wins a free kick on the right wing.\nSubstitution, Celta de Vigo.

He consults and engages with chief executives and presidents... that's been a breath of fresh air. He listens and he's very innovative and creative.\"\nPlatini, a former France international, said he had decided to stand after weighing up \"the future of football alongside my own future\".\nSwiss Blatter, 79, has been in charge of Fifa since 1998. Candidates have until 26 October to be nominated.\nIn a letter sent to the presidents and general secretaries of the 209 member associations of Fifa, Platini pledged he would work tirelessly \"in the interests of football\".\nHe added: \"There are times in life when you have to take your destiny into your own hands.\n\"I am at one of those decisive moments, at a juncture in my life and in events that are shaping the future of Fifa.\n\"During this last half-century or so, Fifa has only had two presidents. This extreme stability is something of a paradox in a world that has experienced radical upheavals and in a sport that has undergone considerable economic change.\n\"However, recent events force the supreme governing body of world football to turn over a new leaf and rethink its governance.\"\nPlatini highlighted his success as Uefa boss.\n\"I have brought Europe together on a unifying path,\" he said. \"I gave all the national associations - big and small - the place they deserved.\n\"Now, I aspire to do the same at world level, to offer all national associations a common cause.\"\nAs a player, Platini won three Ballon d'Or titles in the mid 1980s as well as a European Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup with Juventus.\nThe former Nancy and Saint-Etienne midfielder, famous for his ability to score from free-kicks, also won league titles in France and Italy.\nHe also helped France to European Championship success in 1984 and third place at the 1986 World Cup.\nHe was elected Uefa president for a third term in March.\nMixed, according to BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\n\"Platini can fairly lay claim to being 'a football man', his status as a genuine great former player a rarity in Fifa's corridors of power, earning him respect and admiration,\" says Roan.\n\"As Uefa president, he has also gained credit for increasing diversity in the Champions League by making it easier for clubs from smaller countries to qualify, and at least trying to curb over-spending through his albeit controversial Financial Fair Play reforms.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"However, he has been accused of tarnishing the qualification process for the European Championships by meddling with the competition to increase it to 24 teams.\n\"He has also been criticised for his pan-European vision for Euro 2020, while his stubborn opposition to goal-line technology also makes it hard for him to present himself as a reform candidate.\n\"Most importantly, despite his recent opposition to Blatter, he is associated with the outgoing president's regime.\n\"Not only was he a Blatter protege, he has been on Fifa's tainted executive committee since 2002.\n\"Most damagingly, he has admitted to having 'no regrets' for voting for Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022, a decision which, for many, is symbolic of Fifa's malaise.\n\"Platini has at least been open about his choice of Qatar, unlike most Fifa officials, but the fact his son has been employed by a Qatari-owned sports kit manufacturer does him no favours, no matter how much he denies this had any influence over his decision.\"\nIt's hard to see past him, says BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway.\n\"With four of the six global football confederations telling Platini they would support his candidacy, he will be very difficult to defeat,\" he says.\n\"Those four confederations count 144 national associations as members.\n\"Not all of them will vote for Platini, but a significant number will and that should be enough to get him over the line come 26 February.\n\"Securing Asia's support is the key.\n\"Their two power brokers, Shaikh Salman and Sheikh Al-Sabah, have given Platini their blessing - and what they want they usually get.\"\nThe rules dictate presidential candidates must have been involved in football for two of the past five years.\nThey then have to gain the support of five football associations in order to validate their place on the ballot paper.\nA former Fifa vice-president, South Korean Chung Mong-joon says he will \"carefully consider\" running for the presidency.\nThe 61-year-old is part of the family which founded and owns Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd, one of the largest corporations in the world.\nChung was a fierce critic of Blatter during his time with Fifa and told a news conference last month he would meet with European delegates before making his decision.\nFormer Fifa deputy general secretary Jerome Champagne, who tried and failed to make it onto the Fifa presidential ballot paper, is yet to decide whether he will stand.\nThe 56-year-old Frenchman, who secured the backing of only three national football associations last time round, has \"excluded nothing\" at this stage.\nOne of the more unlikely candidates is former Brazil international Zico, while ex-France winger David Ginola and Argentina legend Diego Maradona could also stand.\nHe or she presides over an executive committee, which is where the organisation's real power lies.\nThe president supervises the committee's

Barnsley's victory.\nThe Tykes were bottom of League One in December but a superb run of form under interim boss Paul Heckingbottom saw them finish sixth in the table, and their two-year exile from

Tony Craig taking his place.\nA mix-up in the Lions defence from a long ball allowed Fletcher to take advantage, as the on-loan Manchester United forward held off Carlos Edwards and fired across Jordan Archer into the bottom corner.\nThe south London side lacked composure and cohesion in the opening 25 minutes, and Barnsley capitalised again when Hammill cut in from the left and bent an exquisite shot into the top corner without being challenged.\nBeevers' close-range finish reduced the deficit but the second half was a scrappy affair with few clear-cut chances, and Millwall could not recover from their poor start.\nMillwall had been looking to secure an immediate return to the second tier but boss Neil Harris, in his first full season in charge, will have to pick up his squad for another promotion bid next season, having finished fourth in the table.\nBarnsley looked comfortable on their second visit of the season to the national stadium, having suffered just one defeat since mid-March to reach the play-offs.\nWith Millwall increasingly playing the ball long in the second period, it was the Yorkshire side who made the crucial breakthrough, as goalkeeper Archer failed to collect Conor Hourihane's corner and Isgrove headed into an empty net.\nThe Tykes looked more likely to score a fourth in the closing stages, although Chris Taylor forced Barnsley goalkeeper Adam Davies into a late save.\nWith 13 victories in 21 games, winning the club's first cup final since 1912 and now winning promotion to the Championship, Heckingbottom has made a strong case to take charge on a more permanent basis.\nThe 38-year-old - part of the Barnsley squad promoted from the third tier in 2006 - built on work done by Lee Johnson, who left Oakwell for Bristol City in February.\nProviding a constant threat for Barnsley on the left touchline, his goal - a sublime long-range effort into the top corner - put the Reds in the driving seat in the first half.\nAfter a successful spell at Barnsley early in his career, Hammill returned to Oakwell in November with the club struggling towards the foot of League One.\nHis form has been a key reason for their improvement in the second half of the campaign, and having scored in their Football League Trophy final win in April, Hammill found the net at Wembley again to help his side to promotion.\nBarnsley interim manager Paul Heckingbottom: \"The message was always that we would start speaking after our last game of the season.\n\"Now we can sort everyone's future out. Everyone knows I want to stay. If I hadn't been on the bench I'd have been here watching.\n\"You can't imagine how proud I am of the players.

The supporters were just acting on this season and the culmination of the relegation.\n\"Frustration has been building up over a period of time. It's a very, very disappointing day. I love football and I love working in the industry ever since I left school, and I didn't want to be involved in anything like this.\n\"I have the feelings of a supporter and I'll never criticise them. Since I came through the door there has been a very toxic atmosphere and you can't be successful with that.\n\"We kept chatting to the referee and the officials and match commander, but we couldn't determine what was going to happen or how long we'd have to wait before it was abandoned and what would the sanction be.\n\"Is the game going to be replayed? No-one knows as it's a unique situation.\"\nHuddersfield manager Chris Powell: \"I feel sorry for our fans first off, coming all this way. I'm sure some will have come last night and paid for accommodation and they were all in a good mood.\n\"What happened is something that I've never seen before. It's unprecedented and what's going to happen now?\n\"To be fair to the referee, he was a little bit in shock but handled it well and got advice from safety officers and the head of police. They tried their best to get the game back on but in the end they couldn't guarantee our safety.\n\"It's strange to end the season this way. There's talk of replaying it but half my team go away on Tuesday so I really don't know what is going to happen.

It was altogether different to the one-sided encounter at Celtic Park, on the scoreboard at least. Celtic had a huge array of chances but were met with stiff Rangers resistance, most notably from their goalkeeper Gilks.\nIn the beginning there was controversy. When is there not in this fixture? In the 14th minute, Barrie McKay crashed to the floor in the box under a challenge from Simunovic. The Rangers fans screamed for a penalty. Craig Thomson, the referee, went the opposite way, booking McKay for a dive.\nDembele dived in the Rangers penalty area soon after and got away with it. Not that it needed it, but the intensity cranked up another notch in those moments.\nCeltic had so many opportunities but they did not have the ruthlessness of before. They attacked off a Lee Wallace blunder and when Dembele put Sinclair through, Gilks denied him.\nGilks, in the team ahead of Wes Foderingham as per previous rounds of the competition, then almost gifted Celtic a goal when passing directly to Rogic. Had the Australian hit a shot first time he surely would have scored from such close range. Had he squared to a team-mate, it was a goal. Instead, he took a touch and got crowded out. A terrible waste.\nIn the early minutes of the second half, Sviatchenko headed home only for Thomson to rule it out for a foul on Clint Hill. It was another big call by the referee - and a harsh one. The foul on the defender was highly questionable.\nRangers had their first shot on target in the 50th minute, a tame effort by James Tavernier, playing further forward on the right with Lee Hodson selected at right-back. Celtic drove on. Sinclair forced another save from Gilks after Rangers were sliced open in defence. Then, Rogic had a snapshot that went just wide.\nOne-way traffic, for sure, but what an almighty scare Rangers gave their rivals just before the hour when Holt had a point-blank shot blocked down by Simunovic. Either side of the big defender and Holt would surely have landed a sucker blow.\nCeltic continued to pile on the pressure and create a mountain of chances. Dembele scuffed a shot from close in, then a Sinclair free-kick somehow stayed out, Gilks getting a touch on it and putting it on to the crossbar.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBy now, Griffiths was on the field and Celtic were playing two up front. Stuart Armstrong was also on as Rodgers went for the Rangers jugular. It was Armstrong who had the next chance, seven minutes from time, but once again the quite brilliant Gilks kicked away his effort.\nWith three minutes left, it looked like extra time beckoned, but no. There was a dramatic last act. Celtic hoofed it out of defence and Wallace lost a physical tussle with Griffiths, who scampered away from him down the right.\nHe delivered his low cross with the outside of his left boot to Dembele running in at the near post. What Dembele did next was delicious - an improvised back-heel that beat the seemingly unbeatable Gilks. A wonderful goal that finally broke Rangers and sent Celtic into the final, giving Rodgers an early chance to claim the first trophy of his Celtic tenure.\nMatch ends, Rangers 0, Celtic 1.\nSecond Half ends, Rangers 0, Celtic 1.\nLeigh Griffiths (Celtic) is shown the yellow card.\nSubstitution, Celtic.

Events since have suggested the decision, which risked popularity and status, was correct.\nThe familiar saying describes football as a \"results-based business\" - and the results since Ranieri's sacking have justified his dismissal, however harsh it might have been at a human level.\nLeicester's attention once again turns to Premier League survival. The Foxes are three points above the relegation zone in 15th and travel to West Ham on Saturday aiming for a third successive league win.\nMatch ends, Leicester City 2, Sevilla 0.\nSecond Half ends, Leicester City 2, Sevilla 0.\nCorner,  Sevilla.

Alex also happens to be an international drug-runner, and an inmate in the same prison.\nMany Orange is the New Black fans will have cleared a large portion of this weekend to binge-watch all 13 episodes of the new season. But apparently that was the writers' plan all along.\n\"The whole streaming thing is changing the way writers are writing television now. It's basically a 13 hour-long movie,\" explains Prepon.\n\"The writers know they can take more time exploring certain characters and storylines because you'll see the other characters in one or two hours.\"\nWith writers penning \"a 13 hour movie\" it was perhaps inevitable that Hollywood production values would become necessary.\n\"The quality of television is so great that the lines are completely blurred now between television and film,\" says Prepon.\n\"When I was growing up [as an actress] on That 70s Show, there was a much more definitive line. Now that's not there at all.\"\n\"Films are just getting harder and harder to make,\" comments American Pie star Jason Biggs, who plays Chapman's spurned fiance.\n\"You have all these filmmakers coming over to television and making very grand epic cinematic shows, like True Detective. That was incredible, that was a movie.\"\nBeing on Netflix instead of a traditional TV channel has affected the show in more ways than one.\n\"Creative freedom\" is a buzzword for the cast, and they frequently mention the lack of \"micro-managing\" that would be par for the course from other broadcasters.\n\"You'd have to make certain sacrifices for this show to live somewhere else,\" says Biggs.\n\"The fact Netflix doesn't rely on the ratings system is really integral to the success of the show.\n\"Because they're not catering to advertisers, they can stand behind the creators of the show.\n\"These writers have the freedom to create characters that cross lines and boundaries and storylines that don't apologise.\"\nProducers got fully behind Orange is the New Black early, commissioning season two before the first one aired, and season three has started shooting this week.\nThe show, nominated for Golden Globe and Writers' Guild awards, has also won praise for casting transgender actress Laverne Cox as Sophia in the show.\nShe recently appeared on the cover of Time magazine fronting an article called The Transgender Tipping Point.\nThe new series promises to continue breaking boundaries with plenty more back-stories, a new villain and a darker outlook.\nDanielle Brooks plays Taystee, an inmate for whom prison is more of a home than anything in the outside world. She explains how her role expands in series two.\nWhen I auditioned it said two episodes and now to be a series regular it blows my mind. Before we shot season two, Jenji (Kohan, the creator) said to me, 'you better get ready, you've got a lot to do this season!'. That's all I knew.\nI don't know how much I can tell you but you get to see baby Taystee, who she was when she was younger. I love the way that she handles herself, dealing with her pain with humour.\nI just graduated Julliard three years ago. Before this show it was challenging to even get in a room to get a meeting with a director.\nMy experience growing up was I did see women of colour acting - Whoopi Goldberg and a lot of shows like Fresh Prince, The Cosby Show - but they were not alongside our Caucasian counterparts. Now. I feel like the door is being opened.\n\"I feel like this season intensifies in all aspects,\" says Brooks.\n\"With the humour and the drama, with the sex and the pain and the fear - the whole pulse of the show intensifies.\"\nOther mild spoilers include a \"temptation\" for Larry, whose relationship with his imprisoned fiancee is described as \"precarious at best\".\nChapman herself is changing - as viewers will know from the violent cliff-hanger at the end of series one.\n\"She's becoming someone even foreign to herself,\" says Schilling.\n\"She's trying on different guises like 'does this fit? Who am I? Who do I want to be in here?'\"\nThe show has made a star of Schilling, whose previous career highlights certainly did not include ending up on the cutting room floor of Oscar-winning drama Argo.\n\"It's interesting to feel more 'seen' as I walk down the street,\" she says.\n\"I think it's kind of great. I love that people like the show so much and it's nice to receive that kind of feedback - intense sometimes, but good.\"\nThe show is based on the memoir of Piper Kerman, who is a consultant on the show, although Schilling insists the character she plays is \"fictional\", and Biggs adds that the cast are in \"completely fabricated territory\" for season two.\n\"I know the real Larry and the real Piper are together in real life,\" he says. \"They have a kid, but that doesn't mean that that's going to happen in the show.\"\nBiggs admits that as one of the few men, and one of the only characters not in prison, life on set can get a bit lonely.\n\"I'm basically working with my iPhone the whole time. I'm like, 'ok, action' and it's me, talking into my phone. Again.\"\nHowever, he is pleased the show has diverted the public's attention away from his role in American Pie.\n\"It's been really refreshing. For the first time in like 15 years people want to talk about something else.\n\"Twitter is amazing in that it's a direct link to the fans and I read what people say. People have a real visceral reaction to Larry's behaviour.\"\n\"I'm slightly biased but I really see Larry as a victim in all this. But the show is brilliant in that you have these women who have done something wrong, committed crimes, and yet we fall in love with all of them and we root for them.\"\nPresident Obama is one such fan - he referenced the show at a recent White House dinner - but the show attracts viewers from all walks of life, according to Prepon.\n\"One of my friends told me her 85 year old grandmother had just binge-watched the whole thing and said, 'can you please watch the show so we can talk about it?'.\n\"I was like, 'this woman who is 85 is in love with a show where the main storyline is a same sex relationship?'.\n\"It just shows how far we've come as a society, which is incredible.\"\nSeason Two of Orange Is The New Black premieres on Netflix from Friday, 6 June.", "summary": "As the second season of prison drama Orange is the New Black hits Netflix, the cast talk about its runaway success, the culture of binge-watching and how they're helping to change the face of television.", "id": "27721317", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nOrange is the New Black is a Netflix original series created by Jenji Kohan.

In one incident last year, state media says, 59 \"terrorists\" were shot dead here.\nBut according to some foreign media reports it was in fact a local uprising in response to police brutality, then heavily put down with live ammunition.\nWe hoped we could speak to eyewitnesses and form our own view of where the truth really lay.\nDown a quiet lane, at the edge of a tiny hamlet, we stopped at one house and struck up a conversation with the occupants, all ethnic Uighurs.\nOne young man, a construction worker, agreed to be interviewed as long as we disguised his identity.\nWe began recording at once, keen not to linger too long to avoid being discovered by local officials or the police.\nIf they had have shown up they would have been delighted though. The man was a propaganda department's dream.\nDid he feel, as some allege, that most of the good jobs in Xinjiang go to China's majority Han Chinese - incomers over recent years - at the expense of Uighurs?\nNo, he replied, things were pretty fair.\nDid he feel any grievance about rule from Beijing, more than 2,000 miles (3,200km) away?\nNo, he supported the Communist Party, he replied.\nAnd he went on to echo the Chinese authorities' constant refrain: that the violence of recent years, in which many innocent lives have been lost, is caused by isolated terrorists, fuelled by extremist ideology, without real roots in the community.\nHe just wanted a quiet life, he said, although he did have one grumble - corruption.\nThe system wasn't the problem, it seemed, but the people who ran it sometimes were.\nIt could be a message written by Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.\nIt's impossible to know how deeply his opinions were held as, of course, to express any other views in Xinjiang would be dangerous.\nBut it felt, in large part at least, that he was being frank and the exchange is an illustration of how complex and nuanced the picture is.\nThere are indeed many Uighurs loyal to the party and the state - both within and without the security services - who may well be enthusiastic supporters of the kind of trade deals the British chancellor is hoping to foster.\nBut then there are clearly plenty of others who are not so keen on the status quo - why else the need for such tight security, surveillance and control?\nAs feared and just minutes after our interview was over, as we were driving away, our car was pulled over by village officials and we were handed over to the local government who kept us for hours in their office before escorting us all the way back to our hotel in Kashgar.\nFor the rest of our time in Xinjiang we entered a now familiar pattern for anyone who has tried to report here.\nFirst the futile attempts to gather testimony from local people, each time encountering something between reluctance and outright fear of offering an opinion, even off camera.\nAnd then at some point during the day, the inevitable encounter with the police and local officials, insistent always that we were to be prevented from doing any journalism without their constant presence.\nThat China faces a serious and growing threat in Xinjiang is undisputed.\nIn the rising tide of violence in recent years, in markets, train stations and tourist spots, militant Uighurs have hit hard at home as well as taking their attacks to other Chinese cities, including Beijing.\nChina's response though has been ruthless: ratcheting up surveillance and security, mass arrests and the rapid processing of suspects through the Communist Party's notoriously rigged courts.\nOne prison, on the outskirts of Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi - not too far from where George Osborne is staying - holds Ilham Tohti, a respected Uighur academic and moderate critic of Chinese policy whose life sentence sparked an international outcry.\nThere's an uncomfortable piece of timing in his incarceration - Mr Osborne and his trade delegation are here exactly one year to the day that Ilham Tohti was convicted.\nHis daughter, Jewher Ilham, is studying in the US, from where she told me she wants George Osborne to raise her father's case.\n\"I want the British politicians to tell the authorities that Ilham Tohti is not a terrorist,\" she tells me.\n\"He has been shackled and beaten and denied food and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he has suffered a lot.\"\nOn our final day in Kashgar, finding ourselves once again in the custody of the Chinese police, we submitted to their enforced guided tour.\nThey took us to the old city, until recently a 2,000-year-old architectural treasure and home to many thousands of Uighur residents.\nIn the past five years it has been all but flattened and rebuilt, modernised and remoulded, to make it \"earthquake proof,\" China says, complete with Chinese style pagodas and cheap camel statues for tourists to pose on.\nThe police agreed that we could film at the city's old Id Kah mosque - under their guidance of course.\nI was keen to ask worshippers what they thought of the heavy restrictions placed on their faith in response to the perceived threat of growing Islamic radicalisation.\nYoung men are banned from growing long beards, women from wearing the full veil and government officials, even ethnic Uighur ones, are prevented from attending the mosque at all.\nBut as prayers finished our minders told us that the permission to speak to ordinary people had been withdrawn.\nI replied that we were going to interview people regardless, and we headed off into the square where we were able to record a few comments from a curious, but nervous group of Uighur men.\n\"We're just ordinary people,\" one man told me in answer to my question about whether the restrictions were fair.\n\"We have no rights.\"\nSuddenly, one of our police escorts heaved into view, arms flailing and pushing the small crowd that had gathered out of the way.\nAs our camera turned to film him, he lunged in fury, violently grabbing it and trying to rip it from its shoulder strap, breaking off the microphone as he did so.\nAfter the crowd dispersed and his anger subsided he spent the next hour or so searching our video files, forcing us to delete the footage of the incident.\nEven by China's standards Xinjiang is an extremely difficult place to operate as a journalist. But nothing has changed there.\nThe big question is whether this is now the right time for what is thought to be the first government delegation from a major Western power?\nAmnesty International's East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, thinks not.\n\"For the Chinese this is a major political coup,\" he says.\n\"At the highest level of the UK government, there is certainly a sense that not only you have to ignore human rights in China to do business, but you have even to make a song and dance about how much you're ignoring it, which is a very naive approach and very destructive in the long term.\"\nThe British government says it does raise human rights concerns, in private.\nIn public, though, the talk is of an ever-closer partnership, including here, in one of China's most troubled regions.", "summary": "China may be rolling out the red carpet in Xinjiang for George Osborne and his delegation of British business leaders but it offers much less of a welcome, of course, to British journalists.", "id": "34332833", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe British government says it does raise human rights concerns, in private.

It gives all citizens of EU countries the right to travel, live and work wherever they wish within the EU.\nBut in response to public concerns in Britain about the impact of immigration on jobs and local services, David Cameron has said he wants to permanently reduce the number of European immigrants coming to Britain. He has promised to make this a key issue in his attempts to negotiate a new deal for Britain ahead of a referendum on our membership of the EU.\nWhere did the idea of free movement of people come from? The precursor to the EU was formed as European leaders came together in the wake of the Second World War, wanting to prevent another catastrophic war. The idea was that allowing people to move across the continent - from countries where there were no jobs to countries where there were labour shortages - would not only boost European growth, but would help prevent war by getting people to mix more across borders.\n\"The founding fathers of the European Community wanted it to be a construct that also had a political integration and for that you needed people to move because the minute people crossed boundaries and borders, you had deeper integration\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 So it was both a social as well as an economic aim.\n\"If you wish to create a structure which would stop Germany and France ever going to war again, which was at the heart of the original principle,\" says Gisela Stuart, the Bavarian-born Labour MP for Birmingham Egbaston, \"you did require a movement of the people in that area which would simply mean brother would never take up arms against brother again. And that has been achieved.\"\nBut over time, the idea of Europe as an economic union evolved into a more political project.\n\"The big shift came in the early 1990s, [with] the Treaty of Maastricht, explains Floris de Witte, a Belgian political scientist at the London School of Economics. \"It was a big treaty that changed the nature of the EU from really an economically-oriented project towards a more politically-oriented project. And one of the manifestations of that was that we had something called European Citizenship.\n\"Before that, European rights were only for people that were economically active, that moved across borders in order to work or to provide a service in economic terms. After that it became much more of a political concept whereby every European citizen had certain rights to free movement.\n\"It allows individuals essentially to really figure out what is most important for them. If the most important thing in my life is to have sun all day, I now have the right to move to Spain or to Greece. If the most important thing in my life is saunas, I can go to Finland.\"\nIn 2004, the EU expanded eastwards. For people who had lived behind the Iron Curtain for decades, this right to choose where to live and work would have felt like a remarkable liberation.\nMany EU countries predicted that would be a big movement of people from east to west after expansion, and introduced transitional controls to limit this movement.\nBut the Labour government in Britain chose not to introduce temporary controls. As a result, migration to Britain from the rest of Europe significantly increased, with most of the extra numbers coming from Eastern Europe.\n\"There were some areas that before EU enlargement really didn't have a lot of migration at all and that have now become significant destinations,\" says Madeleine Sumption, director of the Oxford Migration Observatory.\n\"Boston in Lincolnshire, for example, at the time of the 2001 census had about three per cent of its population born abroad and within 10 years had seen a large increase in immigration, up to about 15 per cent of the population.\"\nIt was this new wave of migration after 2004 that generated a sense of public unease about impacts on jobs and services. Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, has seized on these public concerns, arguing that high levels of migration from the rest of Europe have effectively been imposed on Britain by the European Union. He's used it to bring to life the idea too much power has been transferred to Brussels.\nUnder pressure from the popular support UKIP were attracting in the run up to May's election, David Cameron promised a referendum on Britain's EU membership if he won, and to put freedom of movement at the heart of his negotiations for a new deal between Britain and Europe.\nIf Switzerland's experience is anything to go by, this is unlikely to go down well with European leaders. Switzerland is not a member of the EU but has signed up to its founding principles.\nLast year, the Swiss voted in a referendum to introduce quotas for EU migrants. The response from Europe has been hardline: the Swiss cannot introduce quotas without losing its agreements with the EU in other areas.\nPerhaps this is why Cameron isn't proposing quotas. Instead, he's focusing on making the UK a less attractive place to come. Back when the EU's founding fathers established freedom of movement, they also gave people the same rights to welfare benefits as citizens of their host country - in order to incentivize people to move to countries with labour shortages.\nCameron's proposal is to limit the right of European migrants to claim UK benefits like in-work tax credits.\nPawel Swidlicki, a migration specialist at the Open Europe think-tank, believes that the benefit system \"enables people to work for a lower wage than they would otherwise be prepared to work for because they know that their income can be topped up by quite generous in work benefits.\n\"So removing this would actually remove the perverse incentive where it's worth their while to come over to the UK from other EU member states - in some cases actually taking a pay cut.\"\nCameron has argued Britain's benefits system makes the UK particularly attractive because, unlike most benefits systems on the continent, rights to benefits are based on someone's needs, not contribution over time.\nBut fewer than one-in-five migrants from Eastern European countries claim in-work benefits. So some have questioned whether this will have much of an impact at all.\n\"It's got nowhere near the real issue,\" argues David Davis, the Conservative MP for Haltemprice and Howden.\n\"The real driver of people, let's say coming from Bulgaria to Britain, is the massive difference in average wages. Their average wage is less than a third of our minimum wage. If I were a Bulgarian or a Romanian or a Pole, I'd be in London right now.\n\"But that's not about benefits. Benefits makes it a little bit more attractive, but really the basic minimum wage drags people here from across the whole continent.\"\nThis debate is a high-stakes one for Britain, with Cameron making his support for the UK remaining in the EU conditional on being able to get some kind of deal in this area.\nBut it's not only Britain's demands that will be causing a headache for European leaders. The fundamental question at the heart of Cameron's proposals is really one of who gets to decide: the European collective or the nation state? There are growing echoes of this debate across the rest of Europe, particularly in the wake of the eurozone crisis.\n\"When we see, in France, the Front National calling for the end of the Schengen Agreement and for returning immigrants to the countries, this is - even if it's from the right - at the end of the day the same populist, nationalist reaction that we see in Greece from the far-left when they claim that they've lost sovereignty,\" says Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, head of office at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Madrid.\n\"It's a new axis of politics that it's forming across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not a left-right one\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a sovereignty axis.\"\nSo the European response to the debate we're having here in Britain on freedom of movement could turn out to be a litmus test - that not only determines Britain's future in Europe, but which also has implications for the future of the European project itself.\nAnalysis - Free Movement: Britain's Burning EU Debate is in BBC Radio 4 at 21:30 BST on 26 July 2015 and also available on BBC iPlayer.", "summary": "Why does free movement of people - one of the founding principles of the European Union - look set to become so important in the debate about whether Britain should remain in the EU?", "id": "33655318", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"Free movement of people - alongside free movement of goods, services and capital - is one of the four founding principles of the European Union.

Villages destroyed, crops burnt, wells poisoned, torture, rape, starvation sieges, mass bombing of civilians, and what only a decade ago might have been unthinkable - chemical weapons.\nThere is no doubt that war crimes have been committed by all sides, the commission says. In each report there is a demand for \"accountability\" - that no-one should be allowed to commit such horrific acts and get away with it.\n\"This would be incredible, a scandal,\" says commission member Carla Del Ponte, who describes the violations in Syria as by far the worst she has ever come across. \"But nothing happens, only words, words, and more words.\"\nMs Del Ponte, as a former prosecutor at the tribunal for Yugoslavia, and the woman who put Slobodan Milosevic in the dock, knows how to bring war criminals to book.\nWhile the Syria commission has no power to prosecute, what it does have is a vast amount of evidence, and a confidential list of names, thought to include figures at the very top of the Syrian government and military.\nTo bring those individuals (including, Ms Del Ponte thinks, President Assad) to court, the UN Security Council would have to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court. And throughout the Syria conflict, the Security Council has been divided, with Russia and China in particular resisting what they regard as unnecessary interference in Syria's problems.\nNow, though, the United Nations, under new Secretary General Antonio Guterres, appears to be flexing its muscles.\nA new body has been set up, called, rather dryly, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism or IIIM, to sift the evidence, build cases, and pass them to any court that could have jurisdiction. Some European countries are already opening cases.\nAt its head is an experienced French judge, Catherine Marchi-Uhel, who has worked on the tribunal for former Yugoslavia, and the Extraordinary Courts of Cambodia, which prosecuted the Khmer Rouge.\n\"This gives me hope that something is moving,\" says Alain Werner, director of Civitas Maxima, a Swiss organisation that works to ensure justice for victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\"I didn't even think this body would be set up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this is proof [the UN] is serious.\"\nMr Werner's own organisation has already built cases against suspected war criminals from Sierra Leone and Liberia, and his work with victims has shown him, he says, that \"the eagerness for justice is immense\".\nOne of his colleagues, Antonya Tioulong, knows personally just how important this can be. Her sister and brother-in-law were tortured and murdered in Phnom Penh's notorious S-21 detention centre during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.\nIn the 1990s, almost two decades after her sister's death, Antonya was able to learn what had happened to her, and she tried to bring a case in the French courts against the Khmer Rouge officers who had run S-21. It was rejected.\n\"I felt powerless. There was no sign, either, of an international tribunal. I wondered, 'Were the two million victims of the Khmer Rouge genocide so unimportant in the eyes of the world that the criminals did not need to be judged?'\"\nAntonya had to wait until 2008, when an international tribunal was finally set up. The men who murdered her sister were at last convicted.\nShe was comforted not just by the verdict, but by the fact that the tribunal was public.\n\"Thousands of people came from all over the world to attend the hearings in person, showing their desire to understand what happened.\"\nBut many thousands of victims still wait. In the Swiss capital, Berne, the Red Cross Centre for Victims of Torture and War had more than 4,000 consultations in 2016 alone.\n\"Almost the most important thing is that they have the space and time to talk,\" says psychologist Carola Smolenski. \"We have patients from former Yugoslavia who still suffer chronically from their experiences.\"\nFor many of these patients, however, there may never be a public tribunal where perpetrators are convicted, and the suffering of their victims formally recognised in a court of law.\nInstead, the Red Cross Centre has included a form of \"validation\" process as part of the therapy.\n\"We will prepare [together with the patient] a detailed chronological report,\" says Carola Smolenski. \"We recognise the experience together, and we sign it as witnesses.\"\n\"It is important that they can say, 'That is my story, and it is being taken seriously.'\"\nFor the millions of Syrians waiting in refugee camps, or trapped in besieged cities, peace cannot come soon enough. But millions of Syrians, too, are waiting to know the fate of loved ones who disappeared into Syria's prisons, or vanished in the heat of battle.\nIn Geneva, the UN peace process is inching along. In the talks about Syria in the Kazakh capital, Astana, the Russians, Turks, and Iranians are working to negotiate \"de-escalation zones\" to reduce the violence.\nBut in neither the Geneva process nor Astana is there much talk of accountability for the undoubtedly massive number of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is unclear whether the newly formed IIIM has a role in the peace process at all.\nCould this be because leaders, on all sides of Syria's conflict, might not be motivated to reach a peace deal if they thought a war crimes trial would be their reward?\n\"You might have put your finger on it,\" says one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nThe idea that achieving peace, or at least an absence of war, should take priority over justice is often advanced during tricky diplomatic negotiations.\nSome also suggest that war crimes tribunals can sow the seeds of future discord, particularly if victims are from one ethnic group and perpetrators from another.\nArchbishop Emeritus of Cape Town the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu famously did not want a tribunal for South Africa, pushing instead for a truth and reconciliation process, in which the accused would acknowledge their crimes but also be forgiven by their victims.\nThe UN's human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, agrees that creating sustainable peace is a complex process, but insists that the authors of Syria's suffering must be formally prosecuted.\n\"In Syria, there will never be peace if you don't put the victims at the centre of your effort,\" he says.\n\"You can have the most finely crafted agreement, but if victims don't feel justice, then it is worthless, a pointless exercise. There has to be an accounting, the central authors must be brought to book.\"\nNevertheless, he sees prosecutions as only part of the process.\n\"At a fundamental level, we will never have permanent peace if we don't deal with unresolved issues.\"\nThis means, he says, all sides in a conflict recognising their conduct, and showing \"contrition\".\nAnd there, Mr Hussein says, society must play its role.\nDuring the German trials after World War Two, he points out, there were 7,000 convictions, but few of those convicted showed any remorse.\nThe push for contrition and remorse came later, through work by German historians, school teachers, and post-War politicians.\nAlain Werner agrees that, in view of the scale of the atrocities in Syria, \"it is very difficult to think there will be no justice\".\nBut, he adds, because the number of cases is \"staggering\", justice is unlikely to be swift. \"Syria could take 40 years\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 even 100 years to investigate.\"", "summary": "For six years, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria has been painstakingly gathering information about possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict.", "id": "40685359", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe investigators have produced 13 reports, the evidence in each is harrowing.

And deliberately so.\n\"I'm trying to make it about the music again,\" he explains.\n\"It felt like I was starting to become a personality. People were starting to know me for lots of other things, which is cool, but I just want it to be about the music.\n\"Don't look at the eyes, listen to the voice, hear what I'm saying.\"\nComing to terms with fame is a recurring theme of the star's second album, called Demonstration.\n\"Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?\" he asks on Children of The Sun.\nOn Looking Down The Barrel, the rapper admits: \"When I'm near the public for too long, I act fidgety.\"\n\"You can definitely hear me battling to hold onto that sense of normality and reality, as opposed to being thrown into this mad world of celebrity,\" says the 24-year-old.\nThe success of his Mercury-nominated debut made Tinie a tabloid fixture - linked with Rihanna and Nicole Scherzinger in the gossip columns.\nBut thankfully his new album isn't an awful \"tears of a pop star\" sobfest about empty hotel rooms and emptier relationships.\nInstead, he lists his distractions - New York fashion week, partying in Las Vegas - before admonishing himself: \"Oy oy, mate, don't sell out!\"\n\"The most important thing is self-awareness,\" he says - but witty lyrics help, too.\nHe writes, on the Daft Punk-referencing Lover Not A Fighter - about meeting his old teacher, who declares herself a fan and tries (successfully) \"to get in my jeans\".\nIs it a true story?\n\"It's not directly literal,\" he laughs.\n\"Without sounding un-gentlemanly, it may not necessarily have been 'my teacher', but it could have been 'a teacher.'\"\nNonetheless, he's keen to find out how the song is received in his old school staff room.\n\"It's going to be like a game of Cluedo! They're going to be looking around - 'was it you?'\"\nBorn Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, Tinie Tempah grew up in the notorious, now-condemned Aylesbury estate in Peckham.\nHis parents had come to the UK from Nigeria in their 20s. His father, a barber, retrained as a social worker and his mother worked as a human resources officer.\nBy the time Tinie was 12, they had saved enough money to move to Plumstead - a short walk from the O2 Arena, which he headlines in December.\nThe youngster picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology.\nBut his life changed when he saw the music video for So Solid Crew's 21 Seconds: Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic.\nHe took a job selling double-glazing to fund his first music video, and was being played on radio stations like KISS and BBC Radio 1Xtra before he signed a record deal with Parlophone in 2009.\nFive of the singles from his first album, Disc-Overy, hit the UK top 20 - while the inspirational, rap-rock crossover Written In The Stars made him a star in America, too.\nBut the follow-up was delayed while his record label Parlophone changed hands, as part of the huge Universal-EMI merger.\n\"There was a holding period where I could release the album in England, but I wouldn't have been able to release it in the rest of the world,\" says the musician.\n\"It was a mad, compromising time. I remember Coldplay had just brought out their album and Chris Martin said to me, 'everyone who got out their album at the start of the year was lucky because there's going to have to be a long wait.'\"\nTinie filled the time writing new songs, and releasing others for free online.\n\"I've realised more and more you need to get your ideas out,\" he says.\n\"Unless you know you've made another Heal The World, I don't think you should hold on to music.\n\"If you empty your tank it'll refill again.\"\nForever attired in a tailored jacket, dark blue denim and his trademark, thick-rimmed spectacles, Tinie was named Britain's best-dressed man by GQ Magazine two years ago.\nHe told the editors he maintained a sharp appearance because \"it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing. What would set me aside from them?\"\nBut off-stage, he is determined to stay grounded. His cousin is his manager, he's constantly in touch with his mum, and everyone has the right to put him in his place.\n\"I don't consider myself a crazy person, so if I do get a good telling-off, I usually know it's for something worthwhile,\" he says.\nHe's coy about his transgressions, though - admitting only that he gets carried away in clothes shops.\n\"People will say, 'you're never going to wear that, you're getting excited,'\" he laughs.\n\"I'm not off the rails... yet, anyway.\"\nHowever, he can't help referencing his new-found wealth on his record.\nLines like \"I'm putting on the pounds but I ain't gaining weight\" permeate the new album - but does he worry that bragging about success will alienate fans?\n\"I definitely do think that,\" he says, \"but all these things are happening to me and you can't not say it.\n\"You know when you've put a lot of water in a balloon, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Sometimes I just want to burst with excitement - and where else should I say that, if not in my music?\"\nHe hopes the lyrics give fans something to aspire to - the same way So Solid Crew inspired him.\n\"I always feel an obligation to anybody who's trying to be like me,\" he says.\n\"I'm a British musician and I'm very much in pop culture - but I have come from grime, a genre of music which is still very niche, and is still very underground.\"\n\"Given where I've come from, there's an obligation to say, 'you know what? The world is a big place, and the moment I left here and applied myself, great things happened.'\"\nHe certainly moves in high circles. He got feedback on the new album from Coldplay's Chris Martin, while Adele advised him on the track list. He's also been picking up tips in Hollywood.\n\"I was lucky enough to go to Jennifer Lopez's house [and] she basically said to me that anybody at the top of their game is constantly still studying their craft.\n\"She gave me an example of the fact that Will Smith, whenever he shoots a movie, still has his acting coach on the other side of the camera.\n\"Even though he's at the top of his game, he still wants to learn. It's such a humbling thing for me, you know, so that was a really good bit of advice.\"\nUnsurprisingly, his ambitions are global: Hearing Beyonce sing Irreplaceable in Spanish (Irreempazable) made him realise that success wasn't just determined by breaking America.\n\"Playing in Kuala Lumpur or Sri Lanka is just as good a feeling as playing in America,\" he says. \"It's just about being as big an artist as I can be.\n\"I believe in the magic of music.  Hopefully one day I'll make the right song, or the right album, that will impact the whole world.\"\nTinie Tempah releases the single Children of the Sun on Monday, 28 October.

I want women to be paid equally.\"\nWhen asked if Chris Evans was worth 12 of her, Mrs May - who earns about \u00a3150,000 - said: \"What's important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job.\"\n\"On gender and diversity, the BBC is more diverse than the broadcasting industry and the civil service,\" Lord Hall said.\n\"We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster.\"\nWhen asked if female talent working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: \"We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent.\"\nWoman's Hour's Jane Garvey tweeted: \"I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?\"\nNewsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who did not appear on the list, retweeted Garvey's message.\nThere is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background.\nGeorge Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000.\nThe highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3250,000.\nThe annual report contains pay information in bands and does not reveal exact amounts. Nor does it include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm.\nThe figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities.\nThey also exclude stars paid through independent production companies.\nThat means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list.\nThe list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one.\nStrictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the \u00a3200,000-\u00a3250,000 band.\nThe show's other judges, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell, got between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3200,000.\nTess Daly, Winkleman's Strictly Come Dancing co-host, was paid between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3400,000.\nGraham Norton earned more than \u00a3850,000 but this does not include payments to his production company, which makes The Graham Norton Show and pays him a separate salary.\nThe BBC is alone amongst the UK's major broadcasters in releasing pay details for its on-air and on-screen talent. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector.\nAs he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right \"on balance\" that star salaries were being disclosed.\n\"We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,\" he told reporters.\nDuring a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: \"Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe.\n\"The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates.\n\"If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars.\"\nAside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show.\nHer agent said she would be making no comment.\nIf you ask experienced people in the world of broadcasting what they think of these salary disclosures, three clear and consistent points are apparent.\nFirst, the BBC pays below - and sometimes much below - market rates, both at management level and in terms of top broadcasting talent.\nSecond, this move will prove inflationary. Those on the list will think to themselves: \"Why is that inferior presenter getting paid more than me?\" - and will demand a pay rise.\nThird, if you thought it was tin hat time for the talent, pity the poor agents they work with.\nRead more from Amol here.\nCasualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3400,000 over the last financial year.\nAmanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000.\nPeter Capaldi, the outgoing star of Doctor Who, was paid between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3250,000.\nClare Balding earned between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics.\nThe overall spend on talent was \u00a3193.5m - down on the \u00a3200m spent in 2015/2016.\nThe figures also showed a decrease - from 109 to 96 - in the number of stars paid more than \u00a3150,000.\nThe total spend on stars with salaries of more than \u00a3150,000 was also down \u00a35 million on the \u00a331.9 million paid in the previous financial year.\nSpeaking on the Today programme, Lord Grade - a former BBC One controller - called the government's insistence that talent pay be disclosed \"distasteful and disturbing\".\n\"The net result of this is inflation,\" he said. \"Talent salaries and wages will round upwards, they won't go down.\"\nFormer culture secretary John Whittingdale MP said: \"If somebody is earning the equivalent of 1,000 households' licence fees put together\u2026 the licence fee payer deserves to know.\"\nThe annual report showed that the BBC continues to reach 95 percent of UK adults every week.\nIt also said the iPlayer had its most successful year to date, with an average of 246 million requests each month.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But in a 1991 interview, he recalled the questions over his age: \"We got all kinds of flak from the guys. In the first place, I hadn't flown anything since 1961, and here it was 10 years later, and the two guys with me had not flown before at all, so they called us the three rookies.\n\"We had to put up with that. And then the fact that everybody said: 'That old man shouldn't be up there on the Moon.' As if it wasn't enough of a challenge as it was, but that was part of the make-up of all those guys. They are still a pretty competitive group.\"\nShepard had been one of the original seven astronauts recruited by Nasa in the late 1950s - at the beginning of the space race with the Soviet Union. These fiercely competitive former military test pilots were known as the Mercury Seven.\nIn 1961, Shepard was picked out from the other \"fighter jocks\" to become the first American in space - after the Soviets shocked the world by boosting Yuri Gagarin into orbit.\nAccording to Reginald Turnill, the BBC's former aerospace correspondent, Shepard was \"tall, thin and ambitious\", as well as somewhat acerbic in person.\n\"All the Mercury Seven astronauts were [ambitious] because thousands of people applied to be Nasa astronauts,\" says Mr Turnill. \"Shepard was probably the most pushy of the seven.\"\nAccording to Turnill, Shepard had initially harboured ambitions to become the first man on the Moon - an accolade that eventually went to Neil Armstrong.\nBut in the early 1960s, Alan Shepard had been diagnosed with a rare condition of the inner ear called Meniere's disease. This disorder, caused when fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear, can affect both hearing and balance, resulting in disorientation, dizziness and nausea.\nConsequently, he was disqualified from space flight and only allowed to fly Nasa's T-38 training aircraft with a second qualified pilot on board.\nAs Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham explains in his memoirs The All American Boys: \"For a man of Al's temperament, ambition and ability, this kind of dependence had to be a helluva blow to his pride.\"\nShepard had been compensated with a senior desk job in Nasa's astronaut corps, but Cunningham says that, as crew after crew took the flight to the Moon, \"Al must have felt like the boy left to guard the sheep while the hunters went after the fox.\"\nIn 1969, he checked himself into a Los Angeles hotel under a pseudonym to undergo a new and, at the time, risky operation to correct his inner ear condition. The surgeon successfully implanted a small tube in his inner ear to drain the fluid away.\n\"I finally found a gent who corrected my ear problem surgically, and after Nasa looked at me for perhaps a year, they decided that I was well enough to fly again,\" Shepard explained in 1991.\nShepard kept the surgery from his peers, but they soon noticed he was flying Nasa's T-38 plane by himself.\nThe first American in space began training again, with his sights set on commanding the Apollo 13 mission. But navigating Nasa politics was going to be vital if he was ever going to walk on the Moon.\nAlan Shepard embarked on an internal campaign for a place on the prime crew. Luckily he was backed in his endeavour by longtime friend Deke Slayton - another of the original Mercury Seven - who was responsible for Apollo crew assignments at the time.\nAccording to Walt Cunningham, there was a sentimental wave of support for Shepard, but some were resentful of what Cunningham calls the astronaut's \"giant leap to prime crew\".\nShepard's place on the Apollo 13 flight looked assured, until Nasa's associate administrator George Mueller blocked the appointment.\nThe astronaut recalled in 1991: \"The deal I tried to cut with Nasa was to give me command of Apollo 13. And they said 'Oh no. We can't do that, you are too much of a political problem.' I said: 'Well now, I've been training along with all these other guys, and I'm ready to go.'\n\"And they said, 'Well, we know that, but the public doesn't know that. So we will make a deal with you. We will let you command Apollo 14 if you will give us another crew for Apollo 13.' So Slayton and I gave them another crew.\"\nReg Turnill explains: \"I was among those who were very surprised when [Shepard] became commander [of Apollo 14]. He didn't have any experience of previous flights at all.\n\"By then there was a steady routine that had been developed, to relieve the in-fighting among the astronauts. There were three crews to each mission. If you were on the back-up crew for a mission, you were more or less entitled to go two flights later.\"\nIn his book, Walt Cunningham details how the chance of a place on the Apollo 14 crew galvanised Shepard's resolve: \"We underestimated how bad Al wanted that mission. No more emotional battles for him. The czar of the office, the steely-eyed stare, had decided to concentrate on his training and tilt no windmills,\" he writes.\nAfter several years flying a desk, Shepard had to get back into shape: \"Al went at it with a vengeance, including his physical conditioning programme,\" Walt Cunningham writes.\nAfter the near-disaster of Apollo 13, Apollo 14 was regarded as a roaring success. As Shepard set foot on the lunar surface he said: \"It's been a long way but we're here.\"\nWhether age played a role or not, Shepard and Mitchell were worn out during their two spacewalks on the lunar surface. On their second moonwalk, they had to tow a two-wheeled trolley a mile (1.6km) to the rim of a crater.\nIn his book The Moonlandings, Reg Turnill recalls that after two hours and 10 minutes of the moonwalk had elapsed, the astronauts were nearly an hour behind schedule.\nShepard's heart rate had reached 150 and Mitchell's 128. They turned back before getting to the crater rim, forcing a geology experiment to roll boulders down the slopes to be abandoned.\nJust before the astronauts were about to get back in their lunar module to prepare for the return to orbit, Shepard staged a memorable - though sometimes maligned - stunt, pulling two golf balls from a pocket in his space suit and dropping them into the powdery lunar soil.\nUsing a makeshift club comprising a six-iron specially modified so that it could attach to the extension handle for a scoop used to pick up lunar rock samples, Shepard drove the balls - one handed because of the restrictions of the space suit - as far as he could.\nShepard's age of 47 is hardly unusual for an astronaut today. In 1998, John Glenn - who became the first American to orbit Earth in a spacecraft - flew on a space shuttle mission at the grand old age of 77.\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk", "summary": "When Apollo 14 landed on the Moon, 40 years ago this week, mission commander Alan Shepard was the oldest astronaut to have flown in space.", "id": "12344613", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/science/nature/4204484.stm\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulrincon/2009/01/alan_shepard_first_american_in.html\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulrincon/", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\"Shepard's age of 47 is hardly unusual for an astronaut today.\"\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"today\".\nIn 1961, the average age of the Mercury Seven astronauts was 37.\nIn 1969, the average age of the Apollo 11 astronauts was 36.\nIn 1971, the average age of the Apollo 1", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\"The Moonlandings\" is a book about the Apollo 11 mission, not the Apollo 13 mission.\n\u2014 Reg Turnill (@RegTurnill) July 20, 2018\nIn his book, Walt Cunningham writes: \"The Moonlandings\" is a book about the Apollo 11 mission, not the Apollo 13 mission.\n\u2014 Reg Turnill (@RegTurnill) July 20", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\"We're going to the moon, and we're going to do it.\"\nThe 1998 moon landing was a success.\nThe 1999 moon landing was a success.\nThe 1999 moon landing was a success.\nThe 1999 moon landing was a success.\nThe 1999 moon landing was a success.\nThe 1999 moon landing was a success.\nThe 1", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/americas/4149199.stm\nhttp://www.space.com/news/030201_apollo_14_moon_landing.html\nhttp://www.space.com/news/030201_apollo_14_moon_landing.html", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe 1969 Apollo 11 mission was a success, but the 1971 Apollo 13 mission was a disaster.

They're flown by a pilot and before a drone strike takes place, you have to have spies on the ground that guide the drones to the Taliban and to al-Qaeda.\n\"Often times, they'll radio the co-ordinates of a Taliban meeting or a Taliban weapons depot or they'll plant a small homing beacon on a Taliban vehicle and these beacons then guide very small missiles directly to the targets.\n\"[Strikes that have killed al-Qaeda operatives who were planning attacks in the West translate to] no new mass casualty terror attacks since 9/11 in the US homeland. So I think that is a sign of success.\n\"What's the alternative? We saw the Pakistani army finally responded to these Taliban and al-Qaeda attacks on their country, and invaded the tribal zones just last year.\n\"During this operation, thousands of civilians were killed, with mass displacement, villages on fire, you know, it was like using a sledgehammer to get an ant.\"\nShahank Joshi is a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n\"The tendency to try and attack your enemies more and more remotely at bigger and bigger standoff ranges is a fundamental part of technological change. And drones are only the most recent part of that.\n\"Over 10 years of drone strikes haven't eliminated al-Qaeda as an organisation - but they have forced its operatives to be on the run, to communicate using extremely inefficient means that make it very difficult to conduct smooth plotting.\n\"Al-Qaeda operatives understand that using cellular phones, email, satellite phones can allow intelligence agencies to give away their location, and so they have to rely on more old-fashioned ways of communicating.\n\"Osama Bin Laden's... couriers had to take messages physically out of the compound and deliver them from a long way away. It slows down communication.\n\"In some cases, like with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, you have specific skills, like the ability to make undetectable bombs, that's held by particular individuals, so by killing the individual you've taken out a very key talent.\n\"But in most cases they've been able to replenish their leadership so it hasn't destroyed the organisation, all it's done is forced them to adapt, forced them to push new individuals through.\n\"In some cases, you have seen more radical, mid-level commanders replace what were more pragmatic, cautious commanders who were killed in strikes or raids at times, so it hasn't always had a positive effect.\n\"[In Yemen,] there have been some cases where very poor intelligence has led to the killing of senior tribesmen, and what that has done is suck new groups into al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, into al-Qaeda's Yemeni branch. So far from diminishing the threat, in places it has also worsened it.\n\"The mistake has been to think that you can engage in drone strikes without adequate intelligence. Where the intelligence is there, they have been reasonably effective. Where the intelligence hasn't been there, I think they have had more counter-productive effects.\"\nProf Daniel Byman has advised the US government on counter-terrorism policy and served on the 9/11 Inquiry.\n\"You can have a safe haven like the Taliban's Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks, where you have a supportive government that allows a terrorist group to organise [and] essentially build a mini-army with thousands of people being trained.\n\"There's an important difference when there's a safe haven in a warzone versus a safe haven in a country at relative peace.\n\"So in Pakistan, where the al-Qaeda figures in the tribal areas normally would be relatively safe, the drone campaign has put tremendous pressure on them.\n\"We have internal al-Qaeda documents that were captured where they're complaining that the training is miserable because people are afraid of being killed.\n\"In contrast, drone strikes on Islamic State leaders who are on the front lines in Syria or Iraq will have much less impact, these are people who are dodging death on a daily basis. So drones might make it slightly more dangerous, but they're not going to fundamentally transform the situation from a safe one to an unsafe one.\n\"The drone strikes first of all need to be a campaign, not just a one-off. You need to be convincing local militants that the strikes could happen all the time, anytime and thus affect their behaviour.\n\"Also, you need excellent intelligence, you need to convince the locals and the militants that the drones are hitting the right people and as a result the militants are afraid and the locals are less afraid.\n\"Drones are an important part of overall policy, but there should be a lot more and especially when you're going to have to deal with groups engaged in civil wars, you need to be doing a lot more.\n\"We should continue to do them in some places, but we should also be using other policy tools.\"\nAhmed Rashid is a Pakistani journalist and author and an expert on militant Islam.\n\"There's no doubt that drones, even if they just kill one civilian, are very easy to use as a propaganda tool to recruit young people, impressionable people.\n\"There was never any political strategy to win over the local population [in the so-called tribal areas in north-western Pakistan, from where al-Qaeda operated for years].\n\"This is a very rugged, mountainous region. There's very little arable land. There are very few prospects. Families are divided, and the issue of poverty is not resolved, because electricity, energy, gas, are all in short supply.\n\"A much more comprehensive strategy is needed [to win over hearts and minds] both by the Americans and the Pakistanis and the Afghans. And all that is completely missing.\n\"There is a very strong lobby of tribesmen who were in favour of drone strikes, because they hated the Taliban, and they hated al-Qaeda. Hearts and minds have not been won over.\n\"This war is still going on, many of these militants have moved into Afghanistan and now they've moved back into the tribal areas, this threat is not going to go away in a hurry.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05.

The Real Madrid forward was suspended along with Neil Taylor, while several others were injured.\nGiven those they were without, Wales had to be resilient in the face of intense Serb pressure and an intimidating home crowd.\nThey defended bravely and, after Ramsey's insolent opening goal, had to be at their dogged best to repel chances for Mitrovic and others.\nHowever, their immense workload eventually took its toll and a tiring defence allowed Mitrovic the space in the penalty area to fire past Wayne Hennessey at his near post.\nSerbia had opportunities to score a second - captain Branislav Ivanovic headed one fine chance wide - but Wales dug deep to frustrate the relentless hosts and draw five consecutive games for the first time in their history.\nBale's suspension left an enormous void in the Welsh side, and so it was left to their other leading players fill that chasm.\nRamsey accepted the challenge with relish. Vokes' shirt was pulled at a corner and, after an initial confusing delay, referee Manuel De Sousa pointed to the spot.\nThere was a deafening din of boos as Ramsey placed the ball, but the Arsenal midfielder ignored the hysteria and audaciously dinked the ball into the right corner, wrongfooting goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic and sparking ecstatic celebrations among the Wales fans.\nThe phrase 'Panenka' is often used to describe similar goals, referring to a spot-kick taken by Czechoslovakia's Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championship final shootout.\nPanenka chipped the ball down the middle of the West Germany goal to seal victory in the cheekiest fashion imaginable and, coincidentally, that was also at Stadion Rajko Mitic in Belgrade.\nHowever, Serbia's resurgence meant that Ramsey's moment of impudent inspiration was only enough to give Wales a fifth successive draw, preserving their slim hopes of qualifying for only a third major tournament in their history.\nWales boss Chris Coleman on Sky Sports: \"It was a great point. But we were 1-0 up, they weren't peppering Wayne Hennessey.\n\"You expect a tough game here but we had chances over 90 minutes. You aren't going to come here and play open football, we did that before and you know what happened. We lost 6-1.\n\"I can't fault the players, they worked so, so hard. Joe Ledley hasn't played for three months and he gave me 90 minutes, incredible.\n\"We can't seal the deal. Last campaign we saw them out but that's where we are. We weren't standing there biting our nails. It's all to play for. Serbia have got to go to Austria and the Republic of Ireland. It will go down to the wire.\"\nMatch ends, Serbia 1, Wales 1.\nSecond Half ends, Serbia 1, Wales 1.\nAttempt missed. Aaron Ramsey (Wales) right footed shot from outside the box misses to the left.

Since he got the job, Gatland has placed great store in British and Irish teams going to intimidating places - and winning. That, after all, is what the Lions are going to have to do in New Zealand this summer.\nGlasgow won that game. It was a tumultuous performance. Finn Russell was man of the match - no mean feat given he was up against Dan Carter. The Glasgow forwards were immense. Jonny Gray made 19 tackles in what was, arguably, his finest ever performance.\nA little over a month later, Glasgow were on their travels again. When they went to Welford Road, where the hosts had lost once in Europe in 10 years - the heat couldn't have been any higher. They had to beat Leicester to make the last eight. It was their be-all and end-all for the season. A massive pressure game. Glasgow won 43-0.\nEvery one of their players routed their opposite number. All of a sudden, Lions-watch, the game so beloved by pundits in all four countries, started to have a whole lot more Scots in the equation. When Vern Cotter's team turned over Ireland on the opening weekend of the Six Nations, the forecasts for Scots in New Zealand went north.\nNow the merits of a dozen players were being discussed. Stuart Hogg, the one Scottish banker at the beginning of the season following the cruel loss of another banker, WP Nel, to injury, was joined in the conversation by Tommy Seymour, Huw Jones, Alex Dunbar, Russell, Greig Laidlaw, Fraser Brown, Zander Fagerson, the Gray brothers, Hamish Watson, Ryan Wilson and John Barclay. Even Josh Strauss, playing his very best stuff at the time, was mentioned.\nLaidlaw, 100% with the placed ball and brilliant in leading his team through the closing minutes against the Irish, was suddenly being mentioned as a possible midweek Lions captain.\nLike a rugby version of the Grand National, there was a faller at the second fence. In Paris, Laidlaw was invalided out of the Six Nations. The Scottish scrum took such a pounding that Fagerson stumbled there as well, but most others galloped on.  Hogg scored another try, Brown, the Grays, Strauss and Watson were outstanding.\nScotland didn't win in Paris but they dogged it out and got a losing bonus point that they probably had no right to get. In adversity - players dropping like flies through injury - they stood up.\nWhat was called the 'big test' was the visit of the Welsh, who had so many Lions veterans in their ranks. The argument went that if Scotland could out-play Wales then Gatland would have to pay respect to that. The Scots were on the back foot for the opening half and then delivered a dominant 40 minutes.\nThey scored 20 unanswered points in the second half and won in a relative canter. Watson was a revelation. Wales had Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric on the pitch but when Alun Wyn Jones was asked about the pivotal performer on the day he mentioned Watson and the chaos he wreaked on the Welsh breakdown. Wales were turned over 17 times.\nRussell comprehensively out-played Dan Biggar. Brown out-played Ken Owens. Watson outshone Warburton and Tipuric. Jonny Gray with 15 carries was the best second row on the pitch. Ryan Wilson with 18 carries was the best number eight. The Scottish back three and the Scottish midfield offered more than their Welsh counterparts. Lions-watch now had Scots all over the radar.\nAnd then, Twickenham. Gatland was in Edinburgh that week. He did some media stuff. When he spoke again about the need to see players going into a hostile environment and performing there was no mistaking his message. He laid it on with a trowel. This was another fence that the Scottish boys needed to clear.\nTwickenham turned out to be Becher's Brook and The Chair rolled into one. Down they came. That weekend, and the one that followed, was a wounding one. The night before England opened up against Scotland, Wales rediscovered themselves against Ireland. Then the following weekend Ireland rediscovered themselves against England. Some big names were jockeying for position.\nFor some of the Scots there was a chance to make amends for Twickenham and to give Gatland more of what he wanted - Glasgow's Champions Cup quarter-final against Saracens. It didn't happen. Watson's excellence, meanwhile, was being diluted amid the awfulness of Edinburgh's season.\nWhat started off back in the autumn as a possible feel-good story for Scotland is now looking altogether more chilling. Hogg is a shoo-in for Gatland's squad and it would be a surprise if Seymour doesn't make it. The wing is a predator, magnificent in the air, strong defensively and has surely done enough.\nSean Maitland also has to be in the conversation on the wing. His Saracens team-mate, Duncan Taylor, has been outrageously unlucky with injury, but will still go close. He's big and tough, creative and intelligent. A serious player. Had he been fit to play in the Six Nations he might now be considered a favourite to make it.\nLaidlaw was denied the chance to lay down a major claim, but it's as if he doesn't exist now. A forgotten man. The top two scrum-halves are Conor Murray and Rhys Webb. Ben Youngs is suggested as the third. If he is, he's an vulnerable third. Laidlaw steered Scotland home wonderfully against Ireland. He's clever, mentally tough and has a boot that rarely lets his team down. As a midweek captain, the Lions could do a whole lot worse.\nTake away the Twickenham horror-show and Fraser Brown is not far away. The leading three hookers, it would appear, are Rory Best, Jamie George and Ken Owens. Nobody will forget Twickenham, but nobody should forget either what he did in victory in other pressure games against Racing and Leicester, Ireland and Wales. Brown raged against the Saracens machine as well. He went down, fighting. Is Owens really that far ahead of him?\nZander Fagerson is worthy of consideration as a seventh prop - if, indeed, it's true that Gatland intends to bring seven as opposed to the usual six. The vibe right now is that Wales' Tomas Francis makes it. There's a case to be made that Fagerson's ball-carrying makes him a better bet.\nThe Grays look to be done, shunted out of the reckoning by a championship that petered out and by rivals who finished thunderously. Watson is one you really root for. He has maintained high standards throughout the farrago of Edinburgh's season. He was exceptional at various points during the Six Nations. He bossed an exalted Welsh back-row. And yet you can't see him making it. The competition is beastly.\nIt's been said, by Gatland and others, that because there is no Scot on the coaching ticket that Scottish players might be at a disadvantage. Gregor Townsend turned down a role as did Jason O'Halloran, an adopted Scot, who was Cotter's attack coach. It's an odd argument. Gatland has eyes in his head. He also has a phone, which he can use to get information, if he wants it.\nDoomsday scenario is one Scot: Hogg. A sliver less than doomsday is two: Hogg and Seymour. Fatalism begins to sink in after that. There could a third, but trying to read the Gatland tea-leaves, it's hard to see a fourth. It's a brutal business, this.\nThe speculation will end around midday on Wednesday. The post-mortem will follow swiftly.", "summary": "In mid-December, Glasgow travelled to Paris to play Racing 92 in a high-pressure Champions Cup match, the kind that could have spelled death to the Warriors had they lost it.", "id": "39631391", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"Scotland's season was a wounding one.\"\nThe Lions are a team that has to be built from the ground up.

Jon Toral gave the ball away in attack and Hearts raced upfield through Bjorn Johnsen, who rode a Jason Holt challenge and squared it for Goncalves to apply a simple finish.\nParity lasted all of 90 seconds, however, and it was a Noring nightmare that gifted the home side the lead.\nThe Swedish keeper punched a harmless James Tavernier cross into the air when he should have caught it, and then failed to catch when he should have punched, with the ball dropping perfectly for McKay to drill it into the bottom corner.\nLiam Smith missed a headed chance to level before Johnsen fired straight at Wes Foderingham as the visitors started to string some passes together going forward.\nToral forced Noring into a good save at his right-hand post with a fizzing low drive and Tavernier should have scored with a back-post header as Rangers looked for a third.\nMartyn Waghorn missed a one-on-one chance at the death but the home side earned the win that sealed third place.\nRangers fans will have been encouraged by a first-half display that boasted a shape and organisation that has been lacking in recent weeks, while Hearts were all over the place at times, particularly in defence.\nIt was all change after the interval, however, as the 10 men of Hearts went to a back three and looked far more organised and threatening in attack.\nThat change of shape could be significant as Ian Cathro looks to build for next season, while Ibrox boss Pedro Caixinha will be desperate to see his side translate their first-half performance into a full 90 minutes.\nRangers boss Pedro Caixinha: \"It is going to be the last working week before a short period of vacation and we return again.\n\"The working week is ready. I am always working in advance and depending on what is going on, I make some changes after I analyse the game. But it is about winning.\n\"We want to finish well and until the last moment they are here and I am here, we can think only about winning.\"\nHearts head coach Ian Cathro: \"It was a big day for him (keeper Viktor Noring). He was deserving of the opportunity over a period of time.\n\"I think he showed some qualities at times. Of course, there's the error in the cross and when you're talking about goalkeepers naturally it's always a bigger headline than the misplaced passes in the build-up.\n\"Of course there's the disappointment of losing but there's a lot of positives things inside. Today I'm even more convinced that we will be a very good team.\"\nMatch ends, Rangers 2, Heart of Midlothian 1.\nSecond Half ends, Rangers 2, Heart of Midlothian 1.\nJoe Garner (Rangers) wins a free kick on the right wing.\nFoul by Arnaud Sutchuin-Djoum (Heart of Midlothian).\nAttempt saved.

If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\nOn Tuesday and again on Thursday the president made a decided effort to shift the debate from one about the acceptability of white nationalism - a gentle way of describing the racists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners who marched with torches and fought with counter-demonstrators last weekend - and onto more stable footing.\nA recent Marist poll shows that a majority of Americans support (62%) allowing \"statues honouring the leaders of the Confederacy\" to \"remain as historical symbols\".\nWhile the survey question was a bit loaded (the other option was to remove them \"because they are offensive to some people\"), the bottom line is clear.\nWhile Americans overwhelming reject racism and white supremacists, a debate over weather-worn statues cuts much more in Mr Trump's favour.\nLiberals will point out that the \"historical\" nature of the statues includes that they were largely erected in the early 20th Century, when southern states were codifying government-sanctioned segregation; that some of these \"beautiful\" statues, in Mr Trump's words, are accompanied by exceedingly racist text; and that local governments, reflecting the will of their residents, are the ones opting to remove the statues.\nThat is all well and good, but if that debate also means Democrats abandon bread-and-butter economic issues, Mr Bannon's side will welcome the exchange.\nMore than an issue of race, Mr Trump set up his defence of the statues as an attempt to protect a way of life under attack.\n\"You are changing history and culture,\" the president said on Tuesday.\nAnd in his tweet on Thursday: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.\"\nWith his \"ripped apart\" imagery, Mr Trump is playing into the anxiety of Americans - explicitly about the anxiety over cultural change, but those sentiments go hand-in-hand with the financial uncertainty and upheaval that has wracked the nation since the Great Recession of 2008.\nThat was a central theme of Mr Trump's winning presidential campaign, an appeal to lower-middle- and middle-class voters who, even if they weren't personally devastated by the economic freefall and slow rebound over the preceding eight years, could see the chasm from where they stood.\n\"These are men and women who are, in the main, still working, still attending church, still members of functioning families, but who often live in communities where neighbours, relatives, friends and children have been caught up in disordered lives,\" was how New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall describes them.\n\"The worry that this disorder has become contagious - that decent working or middle class lives can unravel quickly - stalks many voters, particularly in communities where jobs, industries and a whole way of life have slowly receded, the culminating effect of which can feel like a sudden blow.\"\nMr Trump railed against change - a return to when America was \"great\". And the statue debate, as he's constructing it, snugly fits that theme.\nIn his interview, Mr Bannon dismissed what he called \"ethnonationalists\" as a \"collection of clowns\", but that view seems more an attempt to put his liberal interviewer at ease.\nElsewhere, Mr Bannon has boasted that Breitbart, the publication he used to head, was a \"platform for the alt-right\" - the anodyne term for the collection of white nationalist groups that have seen a resurgence in power and numbers as Mr Trump campaign gathered strength.\nMr Bannon needs nationalists of all stripes - white, economic, even left-leaning populists and anti-trade liberals like Kuttner - for the new political order he hopes to build that will be willing to wage an economic war against China.\n\"To me the economic war with China is everything,\" Mr Bannon said. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\nStanding between himself and a successful prosecution of this showdown are global elites, including establishment politicians, the mainstream media, financial conglomerates and even Trump administration officials like Goldman Sachs executive turned White House economic advisor Gary Cohn.\nIf these themes sound familiar, it's because they were interwoven into Mr Trump's presidential campaign, particularly after Mr Bannon joined the team in August 2016. They were also a central focus of Mr Trump's combative inaugural address in January.\nIf one squints the right way, all of Mr Trump's recent actions can be seen as part of this overarching strategy. There's the non-stop battles with the \"fake news\" mainstream press. The seemingly unnecessary fights with members of his own party, including Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. And the recent announced administration probe of Chinese intellectual property practices, with promises of more trade actions to come.\nSquint another way, of course, and Mr Trump's strategy devolves into the fits and starts of a chief executive who reacts to perceived slights and counter-punches whenever he feels disparaged. The embrace of the Confederate statues is a response to liberal criticism of his handling of the Charlottesville unrest. The feuds with Republicans are because they won't do his bidding. The media-bashing is because reporters aren't treating him with appropriate respect.\n\"I think the president enjoys a scrap with the press,\" says Ron Christie, a former adviser to President George W Bush. \"I think he believes this is about him and the press and how he's going to beat the press. What he doesn't recognise is that the importance of being the president of the United States is to unify the country, to bring people together and to heal divisive wounds.\"\nAs Nancy Cook and Josh Dawsey write in Politico, Mr Trump's behaviour can be boiled down to a collection of anger triggers.\n\"White House officials and informal advisers say the triggers for his temper are if he thinks someone is lying to him, if he's caught by surprise, if someone criticises him, or if someone stops him from trying to do something or seeks to control him,\" they write.\nIf Mr Trump's actions are part of a larger strategy, and not a fit of pique, there is also the question of whether it's correct to attribute this to Mr Bannon at all.\nWhile he appears more than willing to take credit for the strategy, the larger themes of the Trump \"movement\" - border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - were well in place before his arrival, as Mr Trump himself likes to point out.\nMr Bannon may have given ideological focus to what was a flailing Trump campaign last August, but the raw material was all Trump's. And this week - as always - the man at the lectern, the man with his finger on the Twitter trigger, is the president.\nThe \"Make America Great Again\" slogan isn't Bannonism. It's Trumpism.

He could not handle the pressure and I think that clouded his decisions,\" said Shearer. \"The inconsistencies were mind-boggling.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I would give Moss a mark of three out of 10, and I think I am being quite generous,\" added Wright.\nWith Leicester leading 1-0, Foxes goalscorer Jamie Vardy -  who had earlier been shown the first yellow card of the day for a foul on Cheikhou Kouyate - went to ground after tangling with Hammers' defender Angelo Ogbonna inside the area. Referee Moss said no penalty, and showed Vardy a second yellow card for diving.\nShearer: \"This was the decision that changed the whole dynamic of the game. It had looked like we were heading for another 1-0 Leicester win - suddenly they were down to 10 men and there was a very different atmosphere.\n\"I did not think the tackle that got Vardy his first booking was worthy of a yellow card at all, but this one was definitely a dive.\n\"As much as you can criticise the referee for what happens later, Vardy has to take some criticism because it is blatant.\n\"There was no need for him to dive, because he has got the wrong side of the defender anyway. He was expecting contact, contact didn't come and there was even a little pirouette in there just as he was going over.\"\nWright: \"Vardy hardly touched Kouyate - that one was a very, very harsh booking. The referee could easily have had a word with him for that.\n\"For his second yellow card, it looks like a dive to me because of the way he goes into Ogbonna and then gets his legs all tangled up. That is why he got sent off.\"\nReferee Moss warns the Leicester defenders for pushing and pulling opponents inside their own penalty area - then points to the spot moments later when Winston Reid falls to the floor after being held by Leicester captain Wes Morgan from a corner. Hammers striker Andy Carroll steps up to make it 1-1.\nWright: \"Reid had the march on Morgan, who had to try and catch him up. It is soft, but he had grabbed him.\n\"If the referee tells the teams in the dressing room before the game that he will not stand for any holding inside the box, then he should not have to tell the players again during the game.\n\"He has warned them, so he can give a penalty when it happens.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nShearer: \"He warned Huth and Morgan just after half-time but here is no need to give a warning. If it is a penalty, give a penalty. You don't get a warning for a foul outside the box, do you?\n\"I am staggered that the referee chose the 34th game of the season for Leicester to make this point about pulling and shoving in the box.\n\"Why not make the point at the beginning of the season, and go into all the dressing rooms and say 'we are going to try to stamp this out completely so don't complain and moan when we give penalties for holding'.\n\"Do it then, not in the 34th game. This is something that has gone on not only all game, it has gone on all season and it will continue to go on until all referees make the same point.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Moss actually gives this penalty for the softest offence. There were far worse incidents in the game than this one.\n\"Reid goes down far easier than he should do - he dives as well. Morgan pulls him a little bit, but he actually falls forward so it is not as though he is pulling him back.\n\"I don't think that was enough for a penalty - if it was, then there should have been four penalties in the game, at least. Technically, this one is a foul but, if he gives it, he has to give the others too.\"\nWith Leicester now trailing 2-1 to Aaron Cresswell's superb strike, they throw men forward to try to force an equaliser. Ogbonna grapples with Foxes centre-back Huth as he tries to get on the end of a long throw but Moss allows play to continue.\nShearer: \"This is bizarre.

Hammers striker Andy Carroll blocks him off, Schlupp goes down, Moss points to the spot.\nWright: \"The most you can point your finger at Carroll for is to say he was running back in there recklessly and he made contact. He should have shepherded him away from goal, but a penalty? Really?\n\"If I had been playing for West Ham in that game, I would have felt that the referee had tried to even things up, even if he did miss the foul on Huth.

Instead, he and his friends strived to emulate their football heroes by founding their own club.\nAnd so Westfields FC was born, a squad that quickly adopted the winning look of the day, and who are now celebrating their golden anniversary with their best run in the FA Cup.\n\"We bought West Ham coloured kit - we were in awe of Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst,\" said Morris, now 66 and chief executive of Westfields.\n\"When England won in '66, we all played football in the streets, young kids in awe of the win.\n\"I was a goalkeeper because I thought Gordon Banks was the best thing sliced bread - all the fields in Westfields had people playing football.\"\nWhile England's victory 50 years ago looms large over a national team former captain Alan Shearer says are the \"laughing stock of world football\", the success of Sir Alf Ramsey's side continues to spur on the small club in the Midlands Football League.\nWestfields started their season with an extra-preliminary-round victory in the FA Cup and have won every one of their 15 matches in all competitions since. They are the only side in the top nine tiers of English football with a 100% record.\nThey next face Leiston, who are looking to reach the first round proper for the first time in eight years.\n\"We are typical of the legacy of 1966 - we were inspired to go on and do as well as we could,\" said Morris. \"With it being our 50th year we wanted something special to happen, and believe you me it is happening every day.\"\nDefender Andre Bennett is on an FA Cup run as good as his father's - played five, won five.\nThe difference, however, is stark. Defender Gary Bennett reached the 1992 final with Sunderland, while Andre's side Bishop Auckland need to beat Stockport to reach the first round proper.\n\"It's remarkable how many games we have won and we haven't even reached the first round yet,\" said the 21-year-old former Middlesbrough man. \"This is like the final for us, only there is more for us if we win this game.\n\"My dad is over for moon about our run. He is gutted he won't make it to the game on Saturday as he is at Stoke covering Sunderland for BBC Newcastle, but he will be following it on Twitter.\"\nThe Northern League Division One side might be the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, but they do have cup pedigree.\nWhile it is 22 years since they last reached the first round proper, they went as far as round four in 1955.\nThen there is their status as the most successful club in the now extinct FA Amateur Cup, reaching the final 18 times, winning the competition on 10 occasions and featuring at Wembley Stadium.\nManager Steve Riley hopes their latest cup exploits mark the start of a move back towards their glory days.\n\"The players now have the chance to write their own bit of history,\" he said. \"This club has a massive history of winning things, we are aware of the tradition, and the supporters are desperate to get back to those times.\n\"We want to use this as a stepping stone for the future.\"\nAfter being relegated twice in three months from the same division, Stamford were in serious need of a pick-me-up.\nAnd they've found it with an FA Cup visit by National League side Wrexham on Saturday.\nThe Daniels were initially relegated from the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League in April, only to then be handed a reprieve because Cinderford United declined promotion from the fourth tier of the non-league pyramid - the step Stamford were seemingly consigned to.\nThe unlikely lifeline of being the best-placed side with the best points average across the relegated teams in the third level of non-league football was, however, rescinded on appeal in June.\n\"We were wounded there. We felt we were treated very badly and this is helping ease that,\" Stamford chairman Bob Feetham told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.\n\"We will enjoy this cup run. It has taken away a lot of the pain of losing some of the bigger gates that we would have had.\n\"When we heard the draw it was a massive relief to finally come home. To have the tie here and to be up against one of the big clubs in the competition and one with such history in the FA Cup is absolutely tremendous.\"\nHeard the one about the opposition chairman sinking money in to his rivals?\nEastleigh chairman Stewart Donald is preparing to face the Southern League Division Once Central side he sponsors after the Spitfires were drawn against North Leigh on Saturday.\n\"If there was one team I wanted it was North Leigh, as we have a lot of connections,\" Donald, who played for the Oxfordshire side for 10 years and whose company Bridle Insurance now sponsor their kit, told BBC Radio Solent.\n\"Our offices are 500 yards from their pitch. I'd say we probably give them more than the market rate for sponsoring a team in the South West. It's just something we like to do.\"\nEastleigh were the last remaining non-league club in last year's competition, forcing Bolton Wanderers to a third-round replay after more than 5,000 squeezed into the Silverlake Stadium for the initial tie.\nWhile he is in the ultimate win-win situation with a foot planted in both camps, Donald wants to see Eastleigh go through. Not that he could begrudge an early upset.\n\"If they manage to beat us, I'm sure they will be on the television and it will be a big pay day for them,\" he said. \"Of course we want to win, but for me it will be a nice day to be involved in.\"\nAn FA Cup tie that will be both \"awkward\" and \"strange\".\nWelcome to Chester versus Southport, and Jon McCarthy up against managerial mentor Steve Burr.\nFormer Birmingham City, York, Port Vale and Northern Ireland winger McCarthy was a player under Sandgrounders boss Burr for four years at Hucknall Town and Northwich Victoria, and later worked as his assistant manager for two and a half years at Chester.\nAnd, last spring, he succeeded Burr at the National League club.\n\"It's a strange situation and not one that I'm going to be cool about or anything,\" McCarthy told BBC Radio Merseyside. \"All I've ever done is play for him, work with him and always been on the same side as him.\n\"Maybe if he beats us, he'll want to have a drink, but I probably won't want to. And if we win he won't want to have a drink.\n\"But next time we see each other in whatever social setting, I know how much Steve Burr has done for me and how much I've learned from him, so there will never be any animosity there.\"\nBBC Radio Merseyside's Neil Turner, who covers both teams, said: \"On current form, the rapidly emerging student, Jon McCarthy, is the firm favourite to dump his former mentor, Steve Burr, out of the competition.\n\"Burr, who experienced managerial success at Kidderminster Harriers and initially at Chester, has an enormous task to create stability with an

Trailing 10-4 at one stage on Saturday, unable to cope with either course or crowds, the European team were plugged in a bunker behind a tree on another fairway.\nEurope's biggest final-day comeback before this had been from a mere two points down in 1995. So comprehensively had they  over the  that even the overnight 10-6 seemed nothing more than a valiant yet futile rally that would do little but soften the blow of inevitable defeat.\nSo how did it happen? How did the day that at one point had them 25-1 for the win end with Luke Donald spraying champagne all over a cavorting army of overseas support, with captain Jose Maria Olazabal blubbing tears of joy, with the \"U-S-As\" overwhelmed by \"oles\" and Ian Poulter conducting it all with half-cut glee?\nIt began as it surely had to - with Olazabal's first few singles selections all taking the lead early, silencing the boisterous home galleries for the first time and applying pressure to their rivals.\nIt then continued as it had not before - with European putts dropping like the autumn leaves all around, with American efforts skidding past and stopping short. For the first time, mixed in with the cigar smoke and smell of beer and barbecue drifting across the course, there was something else: doubt, and then escalating anxiety.\nIt was a magnificent performance from the whole European team and I have never seen a more exciting end to a Ryder Cup - and I've seen plenty.\nRead more\nThen, at the death, it ended only one way - with Olazabal's men standing tall while American captain Davis Love's much-vaunted home-boys crumbled and broke.\nFive matches reached the 18th green. A US player won just one of them.\nFrom one down with two to go, Justin Rose drained a pair of monstrous putts to beat Phil Mickelson. Poulter got his nose in front for the first time on 17 and birdied the last to see off Webb Simpson. Rory McIlroy birdied 14 and 15 to tame the charging Keegan Bradley, and Sergio Garcia survived those final two holes in one under as Jim Furyk bogeyed both.\nEuropean heroes were not hard to find, even if the first was somewhat unexpected.\nHad it not been for the Illinois state trooper who  at the team hotel and used his sirens to usher him through the streets to Medinah with 10 minutes to spare, the 23-year-old would have conceded the first hole and quite possibly several more.\nFor Poulter, who has not won a tournament since May 2011 and was here only by gift of a captain's pick, this was his greatest hour.\nFour points from four matches leaves the beef from the bone. Endlessly energised, angrily indomitable, he became the standard around which his comrades could muster.\nIn overturning Mickelson when all seemed lost, Rose provided the pivotal moment. When he sank that long, curving 30-footer on 17, European fans started to believe. When he held his nerve to do the same on 18, they knew it was on.\nTucked away in the ranks, Paul Lawrie dished out a mauling. His only previous outing in the Ryder Cup saw him on the wrong end of the other great comeback in the competition's storied history, the US onslaught at Brookline. Thirteen years on, his 5&3 thrashing of Brandt Snedeker - a week ago the winner of the \u00a36m Fed-Ex Cup - was the most agreeable revenge.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAnd what of the man who ended it all?\nMartin Kaymer has been woefully out of form all summer. He was dropped for three of the first four sessions, if not a liability than a fault-line to be carefully concealed.\nTwenty-one years after his compatriot Bernhard Langer missed a six-footer at Kiawah to retain the trophy, the second German to play in the competition rolled home one from almost identical length to lay those ghosts to rest.\nWe should have known that we could trust a German to deliver in a shoot-out.\n\"Olazabal came up to me on the 16th and told me we needed my point to win the Ryder Cup,\" he said afterwards. \"I loved that feeling. Loved it.\"\nFor all that Europe's 12 good men won this, the US's tossed it away on the Illinois winds.\nNo-one who has never stood on a green with the world watching on should use the word \"choke\". But the stony, downcast faces of Love's team afterwards told their own tale: this was in our grasp, and we somehow let it slip.\nTo win just three matches from 12, on home soil, on a course set up specifically for their skills and 40,000 baying boozers roaring them on, is the sort of return that haunts a man until his fading hours.\nFuryk folded as his putts on 17 and 18 stayed afloat. The next man through went from Stricker to stricken in the space of one butchered approach. Behind them both, Tiger Woods - winless from his four matches, grey-faced and silent - looked a bit-player alone on the biggest stage.\nFor their captain Love it was a horrible end to a week when he had done almost everything right. About his only misjudged move was predicting, live on television midway through Sunday afternoon, that Jason Dufner would be the man to hole the winning putt.\nCould he do anything about his players' disintegration? No. There are many things a Ryder Cup captain can do, but hit straight irons and hole clutch putts he cannot.\nFor his opposite number Olazabal it was everything he had hoped: a validation of his decision to stack his big hitters up early in the singles order, a fitting tribute to his old pal Seve, an avenging of the Brookline defeat to which he had the front-row seat.\nOn Saturday night, just as Seve had throughout his career, he talked only of belief. You can do this, he told his players. You will do this.\nFor the Ryder Cup itself, the 39th edition has been another remarkable chapter in a story that so seldom disappoints.\nYou might argue that it is becoming one-sided; Europe has won the last two, five of the last six and seven of the last nine. But today, as in each of those, there was theatre like few other sporting events can provide.\nSo that was our summer of 2012. An Englishman won the Tour de France. A Scot won the US Open. In between, Britons won gold after gold at a home Olympics and won even more in the Paralympics that followed.\nWatching these Europeans celebrate at the end of it - Poulter swirling a union flag over his head, Nicolas Colsaerts sparking up consecutive cigarettes, McIlroy staggering under the weight of a champagne bottle the size of his legs, all of it under a perfect blue sky, songs ringing out across the lawns - there could only be happiness at its final passing.", "summary": "And so, after a sporting summer that has defied belief, the final miracle came to pass.", "id": "19782304", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nMedia playback is not supported on this device.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device.

He has not made the same impact at City as another of their recent big-money signings, Kevin de Bruyne, in terms of goals and assists but he has made a very steady start.\nI think the only thing Raheem will be disappointed about is that he has been substituted in nine of the 10 league games he has started for City so far.\nBut that should just make him realise he is still a young player who has got to work a little bit harder on his weaknesses as well as his strengths.\nHe is only 20 and there is a lot more to come from him. He has the potential to be one of the greats but he will not fulfil his promise without a lot of hard work.\nIt is obvious Sterling has to add more goals to his game, but I think he needs to improve his end product generally.\nYes, he put in the cross to the back post for Wayne Rooney's volleyed goal in England's friendly with France this week.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut I was at Wembley working as a pundit and sitting next to Paul Scholes, who made me laugh when he said Raheem was actually aiming for Harry Kane, who was running in at the near post.\nI don't know if that comment was just down to Scholesy's Manchester United allegiance, but it is true that Sterling's crossing has been extremely poor for City this season - he has a success rate of less than 6% from open play.\nWhether it is his finishing or his crossing we are talking about, it clearly needs to be much better to make the most of his ability to get behind opposition defences.\nMy old Arsenal team-mate Marc Overmars is exactly the kind of player I think he should aspire to be.\nOvermars was a winger but when he got into the box I always backed him to score. His goals-to-game ratio for the Gunners was incredible.\nPart of that was down to the quality of his finishing - he almost always seemed to hit the target, and was capable of placing his shots - but he would get himself in the right positions to be able to score too.\nSterling has been used centrally as well as on the left by City but, if he is out wide, I want to see him get to the back post when crosses come in from the opposite flank to pick up anything that comes through to him, which is the sort of thing Overmars always looked to do.\nSterling's finishing has been questioned, and maybe he also makes the wrong decision sometimes when he is through in one-on-one situations - I have seen him shoot straight at the goalkeeper quite a lot.\nBut even if you are not a natural finisher you can get both of those things right with experience and practice, so it is good to hear he has been working on them in training.\nEven the best strikers work on their technique and he should be using those sessions as an opportunity to miss and work out what he should do differently next time.\nI would look back at chances I missed and think maybe I should have had a cleaner strike there or, if the goalkeeper committed himself early, I should have slotted it past him rather than striking the ball hard.\nBut sometimes there is no definite right answer as to what you do when you are in front of goal - as long as you put the ball in the net.\nIt comes down to the individual and what he believes he has to do. The more times you are in those situations, the more you get used to it and have the composure to get it right.\nI think Sterling is getting there, slowly. Since his move to City, he is getting more clear-cut chances in front of goal, is having more shots and his shooting accuracy is better than last season too.\nNo wonder he is already scoring more goals - he got seven in the league last season but already has four for City - but he needs to keep on working on that aspect of his game.\nFrom watching Sterling I can see he is full of confidence at the moment - he believes he is good enough to be in the City team with players of the calibre of Yaya Toure and David Silva, and he is right.\nIt is great to see, because I know only too well what it is like when a young player has his self-belief absolutely blasted out of him after a big-money transfer.\nWhen my son Shaun Wright-Phillips joined Chelsea for \u00a321m in 2005, it looked like the dream move for him.\nHe was 23 and had been absolutely flying for City, who wanted to sell him to the highest bidder because they were \u00a362m in debt. Their fans didn't know it at the time, but it wasn't up to him whether he stayed or not.\nI was delighted when Arsenal came in but they pulled out when the bidding got to \u00a312m. Then Chelsea blew everyone else out of the water.\nThey were the champions and, at the time, Jose Mourinho played with wingers so it seemed like the perfect fit.\nArjen Robben and Damien Duff were there so I knew Shaun was going to Chelsea to contend with world-class players but, just like with Raheem at City, I expected them to help him improve too.\nSadly it did not work out like that. I went to watch him a few times when he first joined and, no matter how well he played, he would always get taken off. Eventually he lost his starting place altogether.\nIt was heart-breaking to watch but he has got a very placid demeanour so he just got on with it - he never told me it bothered him.\nBut my observation of the whole situation was that it must have affected his confidence because he stopped playing like he had at City, and it had an adverse effect on him for the rest of his career.\nWhen he was at City he was like a little rubber man, who would get kicked, get up and take a few men on. He scored a lot of goals that way and City fans loved him because he had come through the youth team and epitomised what they wanted to see.\nAt Chelsea he turned into a player that played safe. He did not take risks and he stopped taking people on.\nIt is easy to say now that it was the wrong move but I look back at it now and still think he was right to go - there was no way he could have turned that opportunity down, and it is just a shame the way things turned out.\nHe could not have tried any harder - nobody who has worked with Shaun would question his work ethic - and it is just a shame the way things turned out.\nOther players have had the same experience too - a move that looks like being a fairytale does not pan out that way.\nIt happened to Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell when they joined Manchester City. Of course we know now what happened and that they hardly played but, when they signed, they would not have been thinking that a year down the line they would be regretting this - they would have been thinking that a great team is willing to pay a lot of money for me.\nThat is how you go into those deals. You won't move to the next level otherwise and, when you sign, you are thinking you are going to be the player where they can say 'it did work out for him'.\nWhatever Sterling achieves in his career, two things are certain: he will always be known for his \u00a349m price tag, and he will always get stick from Liverpool fans when he plays his former team.\nSterling faces the Reds on Saturday for the first time since his controversial departure from Anfield, and I am sure he knows what sort of reception he will get from their travelling fans.\nI expect he will take it in his stride - from meeting him a couple of times I know he is quite a cool and calm character, and he can cope with being in the spotlight.\nHis transfer should definitely have been handled differently but he was right to leave Liverpool if he thought he could better himself - now he owes it to himself to be as good as he can be to prove his decision was right.\nIan Wright was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "A lot of people thought Raheem Sterling made the wrong career move when he joined Manchester City for \u00a349m from Liverpool in the summer, but I'm pleased to see he has slotted straight in.", "id": "34861421", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nIan Wright was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

We have a never-say-die attitude and will fight for each other until the end.\"\nLeicester centre-back Robert Huth pushed Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic in the throat during the first half, with the Magpies forward falling to the ground.\nReferee Mike Jones gave both players a talking to but did not brandish any cards.\nHuth was later booked for a foul on Sissoko when the Magpies tried to launch a counter-attack from a Foxes corner.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNewcastle suffered their first defeat in three league games after a win and a draw in their previous two outings suggested signs of slow progress being made under manager Steve McClaren.\nAnd, if Magpies fans were in hopeful mood before the match, there were boos at the final whistle from the ones who had not left early.\nThe home side suffered an early setback with midfielder Cheick Tiote going off injured but they were poor in attack and lacked the hunger and intensity of the visitors.\nLeicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel was rarely troubled, apart from when a Georginio Wijnaldum header was cleared off the goal-line.\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"That was the worst performance we have had this season and it is very disappointing. I understand the frustration of the fans and we will get back on the training field on Monday to get consistency back in our results. That was nowhere near good enough.\n\"We have to roll our sleeves up and we know we have the talent. We have to fight for that every day.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"It is fantastic for Jamie Vardy. He is a great champion and did well in training. I am glad because we played like a team.\n\"I also had Gabriel Batistuta at Fiorentina score in 11 consecutive matches and I hope Jamie can achieve this.\"\nNewcastle have a trip to face former manager Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace side, while Leicester will host Manchester United.\nMatch ends, Newcastle United 0, Leicester City 3.\nSecond Half ends, Newcastle United 0, Leicester City 3.\nCorner,  Leicester City.

And that's the graveyard.\n\"People ask me all the time: 'What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?' And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories.\n\"The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost.\n\"I became an artist, and thank God I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.

The teams were so well-matched they tended to cancel each other out and moments of inspiration were restricted, as much by familiarity as any overbearing sense of occasion.\nIt was always unlikely that a player could catch an opponent unawares when this was the teams' fifth meeting of the season.\nAll the same, individuals could be out-witted by their own sense of alarm.\nSt Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Mannus has been a reliable figure throughout the campaign, but he spilled an early Ryan Dow cross and never wholly recovered his self-assurance.\nWith United's Nadir Ciftci and May both strong and adept enough to hold the ball up when it reached them in attack, play was able to swing from one end to the other with pleasing enough pace. Chances tended to arise out of resourcefulness rather than any sustained attacking pressure.\nJames Dunne, for instance, was deft and agile enough to react when the ball broke to him at the edge of the United penalty area. He arched his body so that he could meet the ball with a stinging volley, but the effort was matched by the ability of goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak to tip the ball over with a stretching save.\nSt Johnstone were the more composed side. United often relying on the counter-attack rather than establishing rhythm or control, but while Ciftci was intermittently involved, the trio of attackers behind him - Dow, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven - struggled to deliver their usual swift incisiveness.\nHalf-an-hour had gone before they rediscovered that zest, but it was enough to distress the St Johnstone defenders. None of them reacted quickly enough to Andrew Robertson's run and cross, allowing Dow to nick the ball with his heel and send it bouncing off the upright.\nNerves were beginning to fray, which might have explained why the United defenders were not well-organised enough to cope with a corner kick just before half-time.\nIt was a conventional delivery - Wotherspoon swinging the ball to the back post - but Anderson had the time and space to hang in mid-air before heading it into the net, after Cierzniak had left his goal and failed to reach the ball.\nThere was only enough time to restart the game before the half-time whistle blew.\nUnited had to dwell on the setback, but that fired their resolve and they were eager after the break.\nAttitude alone would not recover the scoreline, but Ciftci was capable of moments of accomplishment and his free-kick from 20 yards was almost perfectly crafted. The ball bounced off the underside of the bar, though, and Mannus eventually managed to smother it on the line.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nTension grew as the game progressed. The lead was such a narrow margin that anxiety seemed the primary concern.\nThere appeared no other explanation for the way May pushed the ball over the line with his hand after his close-range header had been saved. The striker could, after all, have left the ball in the hope that someone else in the crowded six-yard box applied the finishing touch.\nSt Johnstone had to be wary of themselves. The instinct was to drop ever deeper, although United were still restricted to long-range efforts.\nRobertson saw one shot saved, while Ciftci sent another narrowly wide. That was in keeping with their general performance.\nUnited never could shift the forlorn nature of their play and they could not cope with the determined aggression of MacLean. When the ball broke to him in the penalty area, he slid in to challenge Cierzniak before turning the ball over the line while grounded.\nUnited only had five minutes left to rescue the game, but that had never seemed likely as an Armstrong effort was blocked and Brian Graham headed wide from inside the six yard box.\nThe triumph already belonged to St Johnstone.\nMatch ends, St Johnstone 2, Dundee United 0.\nSecond Half ends, St Johnstone 2, Dundee United 0.\nNadir Ciftci (Dundee United) is shown the yellow card.\nSteven Anderson (St Johnstone) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nFoul by Nadir Ciftci (Dundee United).\nAttempt missed.

Whatever can be measured, we are measuring.\"\nThe data feeds back into the INGV's hi-tech control room in nearby Catania. It is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Dr Giuseppe Puglisi explained: \"Collecting this data enables us to detect any changes in the volcano's physical or chemical status. For example: changes in topography, changes in the temperature of the rocks, or on the stress of the crust, or changes in the composition of its minerals or gases, etc. These are all important to identify whether an eruption looks possible.\"\nHowever, very few volcanoes around the world receive this level of scientific attention. Instruments are expensive and it takes many scientists to keep track of all of the data that pours back. Dr Behncke said: \"Etna is certainly one of the most intensely monitored volcanoes on Earth -  maybe the most monitored volcano on Earth. But obviously there are many other volcanoes, and many dangerous volcanoes, especially in poorer countries, where monitoring is much more rudimentary or completely absent.\"\nThe satellite project could make a big difference to these places, but it will also be useful for Mount Etna too. \"The advantage lies in the ability to monitor wide areas of the volcano at once,\" said Dr Puglisi.\nBefore a volcano erupts, magma rises from deep beneath the Earth, causing the ground above to swell. It usually starts as a small movement on the flank of a volcano or in its caldera (crater). It may be barely noticeable to the eye, but it can be seen from space.\nRegular satellite data recording this change will be processed automatically and an alert issued for scientists to follow up. A \"red flag\" would not mean an eruption is a given, but it ought to ensure those communities that live in the shadow of a volcano are not caught unawares if the situation deteriorates.\n\"It's the volcanoes that are least monitored where this will have most impact. If people can be alerted ahead of time, it could save many lives,\" said Prof Andy Hooper.\nThe Leeds University geophysicist is part of the Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics.\nCOMET has conducted trials of the new satellite-monitoring system in Iceland and is now running it in prototype form across Europe and parts of Asia.\nThe plan next is to extend the automated detection of ground deformation to Africa and Central and South America. These regions have some very big explosive volcanoes that are covered only by limited ground surveys.\n\"In Ecuador, for example, there are roughly 80 volcanoes, four of which are erupting at any one time, and a very small staff to keep an eye on it all. So, they will be grateful of the assistance,\" said COMET team-member Dr Juliet Biggs from Bristol University.\nCould satellites have forecast the Etna blast?\nThere is a certain irony in making a report about forecasting eruptions and then getting caught up in a volcanic blast. When we filmed in Sicily, the volcano was in one of its fits of activity, and we had gone to see a lava flow that had appeared overnight. But a few minutes after arriving, the lava started to explode. Blisteringly hot rocks were shot high into the air, which then began to rain down on us and dozens of tourists.\nWe ran for our lives, and somehow escaped only with minor injuries. The event we witnessed is known as a phreatic explosion. Its cause was hot lava mixing with icy meltwater which had pooled underneath the flow, causing pressure to build rapidly. In 2013, scientists studying the Tolbachik volcano in Russia saw a similar explosion as lava advanced over very thick snow. Luckily, they too were not hurt. But it is unlikely that these incidents can be easily forecast - either from the ground using instruments or from space.\nDr Puglisi said: \"It's not very easy to predict phreatic explosions. The mechanism occurs very fast. The explosion is caused by the almost instantaneous evaporation of vapour, usually in small areas. These phenomena are usually relatively shallow and, in some cases, practically at the surface. So this doesn't produce significant changes detected by monitoring systems. And in space, the resolution is not suitable to detect such  phenomena.\"\nThere is relatively little video footage of phreatic explosions and so the BBC film, captured by camerawoman Rachel Price, will be of interest to scientists as they try to learn more about these incidents.\nKey to the space monitoring project is the capability offered by the European Unions's new Sentinel-1 radar satellites.\nThis pair of platforms repeatedly and frequently image the entire land surface of the globe, throwing their data to Earth using a high-speed laser link.\nBy comparing a sequence of Sentinel pictures, in a technique known as interferometry, COMET's computing facility can track really quite small changes in the behaviour of a volcano, on the order of just millimetres (the movements that might be most concerning would in all probability be much larger and even easier to sense).\n\"Satellite radar interferometry as a technique has been around for over 20 years now. But it's really only been used in the past retroactively, to try to understand what happened at a volcano after it erupted,\" explained Prof Hooper.\n\"The point here is to try to see things in advance, to move to more of a forecasting mode; and to have all the data available in near-real-time.\"\nWhat do radar satellites see when they look at volcanoes?\nThe 1,500 figure is the number of land volcanoes that are known to have erupted at some point in the last 12,000 years (more volcanoes exist under the sea but cannot be seen from space). Many will appear long dormant, but every two years or so there is an event on a volcano that has no previous mention in the written records of having erupted. And in some parts of Africa, these records can start as recently as the 19th Century.\nOne of the big research questions for scientists is working out if and when a change in the shape of a volcano will lead to an eruption.\nIt can be a long time between the two, perhaps years. But the statistics suggest it is four times more likely that a volcano that deforms will erupt than one that has not changed its shape.\n\"It's not a case that if you see deformation you should evacuate people tomorrow,\" said Dr Biggs. \"But what we desperately need is more examples, and that is where the Sentinel system is really important because we will be able to track all these volcanoes in a routine and systematic fashion.\"\nThe aim is to have the satellite data on all 1,500 volcanoes being gathered and processed by the end of 2017.\nNow read about COMET's related project to monitor locations at risk from earthquakes.\nJonathan and Rebecca are on Twitter: @BBCAmos and @BBCMorelle", "summary": "A UK-led team of scientists is rolling out a project to monitor every land volcano on Earth from space.", "id": "39642372", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

The Saints looked rock solid in defence against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium and much of it has been down to their goalkeeper.\nWhat must be frustrating for the England international is that he is playing at his best at the same time as Joe Hart - who is clearly England's number one choice at the moment - leaving him and Jack Butland to fight it out to be number two. It is great news for Roy Hodgson and the national team to have so many top-class keepers at their disposal but a nuisance for Forster.\nCesar Azpilicueta started on the left of Chelsea's defence and then moved to the right and looked totally at ease in either position. It takes a rather special defender to play consistently well in his unfavoured position. Azpilicueta is a right-footed player playing left-back for Chelsea and doesn't get the credit he deserves for handling the situation so well.\nThe Spaniard is a proper defender and is always keen to find space in order to join the attack. Against a poor Newcastle he did just that and produced a wonderful cross (from the right this time) for Bertrand Traore to score his first Premier League goal. Unfortunately for him, there is so much talent in the Chelsea line-up he often finds himself in good positions pleading for a pass but getting overlooked.\nWhat a goal the Norwich full-back scored against West Ham. The only problem with Brady's goal in the Canaries 2-2 draw against West Ham is that it didn't inspire Norwich to defend any better as a team.\nThere must be a point this season when either the manager or the players begin to realise that squandering two-goal leads like this, not to mention the one against Liverpool last month, is the stuff that gets teams relegated.\nWell, they've done it. Sunderland have only gone and beaten Manchester United at the Stadium of Light. To be perfectly honest they deserved it. O'Shea must have got a great deal of pleasure beating his old club and I'm not entirely sure that he would have been overly impressed with their performance either.\nDavid de Gea, who has been amazing at times this season, was especially disappointing and played as though he had become fed up with the ease at which Sunderland were breaking through United's defence. Both of Sunderland's goals were stoppable, but O'Shea won't lose any sleep over that. However, if I am right and De Gea is becoming disillusioned at Manchester United that is a real cause for concern.\nLots of managers don't like to buy players in the transfer window anymore because they believe it's a bad time to sign a player. Really? Well Sam Allardyce doesn't seem to suffer from such paranoia. The acquisition of Lamine Kone is a signing in Allardyce's own image.\nKone is a strong, no nonsense, old fashioned defender who would send a chill down any centre forward's spine and who is also proving to be a nightmare to mark in the opposition's penalty area on set-plays. He was impressive against Manchester City and even better against United. All in all, this signing looks like the sort of defender the Sunderland fans could get to like.\nMark Hughes looks like another Premier League manager who isn't afraid to harass his chairman into putting his hand in his pocket during the transfer window. In Stoke's 3-1 win at Bournemouth, Giannelli Imbula looked like he was worth every penny of his \u00a318.3m record-breaking fee.\nHe was creative in attack and resilient in defence and scored a super goal, which he started and finished himself. It was a great win for Stoke, who have made a great decision to freeze their ticket prices for the ninth consecutive season.\nThis was a game between the paupers and the aristocrats. Leicester have players who cost a fraction of the price of Arsenal and get even less in salaries. Yet you would never have detected that in City's 2-1 defeat at the Emirates. N'Golo Kante epitomises what Leicester is all about and the nearest thing I've seen to the former Chelsea and Real Madrid superstar Claude Makelele.\nLeicester deserved a point in this match and if Danny Simpson and Marcin Wasilewski had not panicked at vital moments against the Gunners it would have been a very different outcome. And this is the point - can Leicester hold their nerve?\nWith the exception of his debut for Chelsea against West Brom, I don't think I've seen Pedro play better for the Blues. He took his goals against Newcastle brilliantly and looked bright and inspired throughout the match.\nWhenever I've been to Stamford Bridge this season (and I've been quite a lot) Pedro looks like he is trying too hard. I don't know what he thinks he's got to prove? The lad has played for Barcelona, for goodness sake.\nI don't think I've seen a player change his feet so quickly when going past an opponent. I saw him do it for Shakhtar Donetsk against Chelsea in the Champions League a few seasons ago which almost certainly was one of the reasons they bought him.\nWillian has been Chelsea's most consistent performer this season by a mile and appeared to be above the internal politics and the dressing room antics surrounding Jose Mourinho. The Brazilian absolutely terrorised Newcastle from start to finish. To be perfectly honest, Newcastle were very lucky Chelsea only scored five.\nI haven't seen a better all-round performance from a Tottenham team for years than the one during the 2-1 win at Manchester City. I've been saying all season that Spurs can't win the title and that's because, in the most open race for years, I really haven't got a clue who will emerge victorious. What I can tell you is that against Manchester City, Mousa Dembele made Yaya Toure and David Silva look ordinary.\nThe Belgium international was sensational but, to be fair, I could have selected any one of the 11 Tottenham players on the field against City, such was the quality of their work ethic. Meanwhile, Manchester City's season is starting to unravel and they are missing Kevin de Bruyne enormously. However, if Mark Clattenburg keeps giving Spurs the kind of penalty decisions he did against City then anything is possible.\nAnalysis: Spirit, fitness and belief - why Spurs can win title\nIt must be really refreshing for Jurgen Klopp to have a fully-fit squad to choose from again, especially as they approach their League Cup final against Manchester City. Liverpool were so much better than Aston Villa, Klopp could have rested Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho and also taken a few more days off himself and still Liverpool would have destroyed them.\nRemi Garde's team look more like relegation material the more I see them. The moment the ball fell to Sturridge in the box, from a perfectly delivered cross from Coutinho, you knew the ball would end in the back of the net. We've waited a long time to see Sturridge in Liverpool's colours again and if I were City boss Manuel Pellegrini, I would be working on a plan to stop Coutinho getting the ball to Sturridge in the final at Wembley. Otherwise, Manchester City's hopes of winning the League Cup could be in the same predicament as their title hopes\u2026 falling apart.", "summary": "The top four faced off in the Premier League this weekend and it did not disappoint.", "id": "35574734", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "Liverpool's win over Aston Villa was a good result for them, but it was also a bad result for Manchester City.\nI'm not sure what the problem is with Manchester United.

He believes Willis Carrier is very much the exception rather than the rule.\n\"It's not that the individuals disappear in this, it's just that they need to be part of something larger than themselves to be able to do the work that they do.\"\nSpecial Report: The Technology of Business\nHow technology is helping famers\nHigh fashion learns to love selling online\nCatching audiences from social media\nCan your social networking profile get you a pay rise?\nGoing to work with the crowd\nThis is not completely new ground for Mr Johnson. He has written seven books on how science, technology and human experience interact, including the best-selling Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter.\nHe is the co-founder of three websites - the now defunct Feed magazine, Plastic.com and his current project: hyperlocal aggregator outside.in. He also has nearly 1.5m followers on social media site Twitter.\nHis latest book, Where good ideas come from: The natural history of innovation, is his attempt to explain the phenomenon of inspiration.\n\"[Good ideas] come from crowds, they come from networks. You know we have this clich\u00c3\u00a9d idea of the lone genius having the eureka moment.\n\"But in fact when you go back and you look at the history of innovation it turns out that so often there is this quiet collaborative process that goes on, either in people building on other peoples' ideas, but also in borrowing ideas, or tools or approaches to problems.\n\"The ultimate idea comes from this remixing of various different components. There still are smart people and there still are people that have moments where they see the world differently in a flash.\n\"But for the most part it's a slower and more networked process than we give them credit for.\"\nThe book spans a huge period in history, ranging from the invention of double entry accounting, and Gutenberg's printing press in the 15th century, through to Tim Berners Lee and the world wide web, and ultimately YouTube.com.\nHe had the idea for the book while writing The Ghost Map, about the cholera epidemic of 1854 in London, and the subsequent discovery of the origins of the disease. The story goes that a man named John Snow had had the idea to map cases of the disease, and using that map pinpointed the source of the outbreak - a water pump.\nAs he researched the story he realised that it simply wasn't true - that Snow had had the idea for some time before this and that he also had had a collaborator, a vicar named Henry Whitehead who was central to the investigation. This is what Mr Johnson calls the 'slow hunch'.\n\"I realised there was this theory about innovation, and the spaces that made innovation possible, that was lurking in the background of that story\"\nThe book starts with a young Charles Darwin on a sun-drenched tropical beach in the Keeling Islands, as he formulates his theory on the creation of these coral islands - not simply pushed up by volcanic forces, but the result of the work of millions and millions of tiny organisms - the coral itself.\nHe is at the beginning of the 'slow hunch' that would result decades later in his theory of evolution. The coral reef also provides Mr Johnson with his analogy for the perfect innovation environment - a hugely diverse eco-system where despite the constant competition for resources, existence is dependent on collaboration.\nThis could be a city, a coffeehouse, an environment where ideas come into contact with each other - as Mr Johnson puts it, a liquid network.\n\"You know I think that there are two [perfect reefs] that really stand out. Clearly the web itself has been an amazing reef. Just the speed with which it's transformed itself over the last 15 years is just amazing.\n\"And so much of that is because it's wonderfully set up for other people to build on top of other people's ideas. In many cases without asking for permission.\n\"But I think that the other thing I want the book to be a reminder of is how much important innovation both in the commercial space and the private space comes out of the university system.\nUniversities, Mr Johnson argues, have in many ways exceeded the market in terms of the pace with which they generate ideas - despite the lack of the 'direct reward' found in the commercial arena.\n\"I think there's this abiding belief that markets drive innovation, corporations drive innovation, entrepreneurs driven by financial reward drive innovation, and while that's certainly true in many cases there's also this very rich long history of important world-changing ideas coming out of the more or less intellectual commons of the universities.\n\"The internet was not commercially useful to most ordinary consumers for 30 years really. It was in a sense a 30-year-hunch. It was providing other services in that time but in terms of the ordinary consumer and the payoff for investment it took a long time.\nOne of the other great preoccupations of the book is the concept of the 'adjacent possible', a phrase coined by the scientist Stuart Kaufman. In essence it means that invention is dependent on the right circumstances - as in a chess game, where there are a finite set of moves available at any given time.\n\"You can't invent a microwave oven in 1650, it's just beyond the bounds of possibility. There are too many intermediate steps on the way to something that complex.\n\"So the trick is to find the points of possibility in your own particular place and own particular space. And not jump too far ahead. It's kind of an argument for small modular steps using the ingredients available to you and not trying to reinvent everything.\nSo what should companies be doing to foster innovation in their workforces? Mr Johnson argues that creativity is a continuous process.\n\"Part of the problem is that one day a year they have a corporate retreat and they all go into the country, and they do brainstorming sessions and trustfalls and then they go back to work.\n\"But equally you don't want to have a non-stop creative process where nothing gets done.\n\"Corporations have an opportunity to cultivate hunches and hobbies and the sideprojects of their employees because those are such great generators of ideas.\"\nGoogle is one company that has famously capitalised on giving space for workers to innovate, with its 20% time system. Employees are required to spend 20% of their time working on their own pet projects.\nAccording to the company, about 50% of new features and products have resulted from it, including Adsense, Google suggest and social network Orkut.\n\"One of the lessons I've learned is that so many of these great innovators, Darwin is a great example of this, one shared characteristic they all seem to have is a lot of hobbies.\"\n\"I mean the web was a hobby for Tim Berners Lee, that's one of the wonderful things about it, it was a side project at his job at Cern.\"\nMr Johnson's open, collaborative environment is the antithesis of the closed rooms of corporate Research & Development and the increasingly litigious world of the intellectual property lawyer. For some companies betting on the slow hunch that may pay off in 30 years may seem a risk too far.\nBut for those who yearn to find the spark within ourselves, Mr Johnson rounds off the book with this advice:\n\"Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down; but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies, frequent coffee houses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent.\"", "summary": "Standing on the station platform, waiting for the Philadelphia train one night in the summer of 1902, Willis Carrier was about to have his 'eureka moment'.", "id": "11706476", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

It wasn't for the want of trying [that we didn't].\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I thought the boys played really well, they showed great character to come back.\n\"We'll keep believing while we're in with a chance, and somewhere along the line hope the football gods will shine on us.\"\nOn defender Billy Jones, who was stretchered off: \"The medical team tell me his head hit the ground and he lost consciousness, a bit of concussion. We've sent him to hospital, but I'm sure he'll be OK.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We are disappointed to concede a late goal. It was a fair result. It is a point, we wanted three and we were close.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"They were throwing long balls in, putting the bodies in, from one of those situations they score the goal.\n\"We have four points from the last two games, we have an unfinished job to do.

First Ermir Lenjani scooped over from three yards, before Ledian Memushaj fired straight at Tatarusanu after weaving through the defence.\nThey finally broke the seal just before half-time when striker Sadiku, who worked tirelessly all over the pitch, met Memushaj's cross at the far post and headed past the flapping Romania keeper.\nRomania had 62% of possession and managed 16 shots but suffered from a lack of conviction in the final third.\nStriker Denis Alibec, who helped FC Astra Giurgiu to the Romanian league title, failed to trouble Albania goalkeeper Etrit Berisha and came off with an injury in the 57th minute.\nGenclerbirligi winger Bogdan Stancu, who had scored twice in Group A, only managed a firm first-half volley. The best chance fell to substitute Andone, who was unlucky with a fierce strike that bounced off the woodwork.\nSome blame for their defeat must be attributed to 6ft 6in Fiorentina keeper Tatarusanu, whose handling was terrible and who should have dealt with Memushaj's cross that led to the goal.\nAlbania manager Giovanni de Biasi: \"I'm sure we gave huge joy to the Albanian fans. Not just the Albanians in Albania, but Albanians who live around the world.\n\"Wherever we go, we've found fans who just want to show support and gratitude for what we do.\n\"Today, we got what we could've got in the first two games - you need to score to get results.\n\"We contained a team that has quality and strength and conceded just two goals in qualifying. We got there with heart and quality. We played with our heads and mental strength. This is what I'd like us to do in every game.\"\nRomania manager Anghel Iordanescu: \"A loss is a loss and we're really sorry for what happened.\n\"We had many opportunities to score. We started the match well and controlled the game. Because of a mistake in our defence, we conceded a goal.\n\"In the second half, we tried to impose our style of play and take possession.

I watched them grow this afternoon and I am very pleased.\n\"I think over the 90 minutes, the young players will have gained a lot of experience and they showed that important ingredient, desire.\n\"The replay will be tough because they are well managed and are a good side.

A new book has revealed the location of 80 of the mountain huts.\nFor more than 50 years the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA) has maintained an eclectic network of shelters across the wilderness areas of Scotland.\nThe vast majority are single-storey crofts or huts for shepherds which have long since been abandoned.\nThe secluded hideaways became popular with ramblers and hillwalkers but many were falling into ruin before a group of climbers and walkers formed the MBA to take on their upkeep, with the permission of the owners of the vast estates on which they sit.\nThe bothy network has never been advertised to tourists and information was always spread by word of mouth between those in the know.\nBut long-time bothy enthusiast Geoff Allan decided five years ago that the time was right to produce the definitive guide to Scotland's bothies.\nThe author of the Scottish Bothy Bible told BBC Scotland: \"Part of the reason it took so long was that I only went out in weather windows to get all the photography in good weather.\n\"In Scotland that takes quite a bit of time.\"\nMr Allan, 47, originally from Suffolk, has been based in Edinburgh since he was at university in the city.\nHe says he joined the mountaineering club at Edinburgh University and soon started to use the bothy network.\n\"I come from a youth hostelling background,\" he says.\n\"So free accommodation out on the hills caught my imagination.\n\"Basically I have never really had any money. I would have had many more weeks in self-catering accommodation but it always seems to have been bothies.\"\nMr Allan, who was a surveyor but who now works as a photographer and creative artist, says: \"I had a car when I was planning the bothy research but it got scrapped because I could not afford to run it so I have been to all the bothies by bike and public transport.\"\nThe Mountain Bothy Association (MBA), which does not own the buildings it maintains, said it had no input into Mr Allan's book but that the author was acting as an \"ambassador\" for the movement.\nNeil Stewart, a trustee of the MBA, said it had published the grid references of the bothies online in 2009 so the \"genie was out of the bottle\".\nHe said he was happy for Mr Allan to promote the work of the bothy movement as long as people who used the shelters stuck to the strict code of \"respect for the buildings, for the environment and other people using the bothy\".\nOne of the few purpose-built shelters on the list is built in memory of Dr Arthur Gilbertson Hutchison, a keen outdoor enthusiast from Aberdeen who died in a climbing accident in 1949. It is located high on the north flank of Derry Cairngorm.\nEast of Plockton there is almost 40 miles of wilderness all the way to Cannich. Maol Bhuidhe lies within this area.\nIt is a remote roadless area between Glen Carron and Glen Shiel.\nThe cottage was occupied by shepherds until it was abandoned in 1914. It fell into disrepair and for the next decades it was only used by tramps and vagabonds, people who took to \"stravaigin\" the country during the mass unemployment of the 20s and 30s.\nThe Bothy Bible offers two routes to the bothy, both challenging walks of more than 10 miles which would take upwards of four hours.\nGeoff Allan says: \"There are three rivers so when it is bad weather you can get stuck quite easily cause you have to wade the rivers to get out and there are no tracks or passes. You really need to know what you are doing.\"\nThis battered old estate cottage sits on the vast empty moorland south of Cape Wrath in the far north of Scotland.\nIt is where hermit James MacRory-Smith lived until as recently as 1996.\nInside the cottage, it is just as he left it 20 years ago, with the murals he painted still on the walls.\nGeoff Allan says: \"It is really spooky when you are in there because it feels like he's still there.\n\"It is like a living museum and because it is so far north and so few people go, it hasn't been vandalised or anything. It has been left, a bit like the Marie Celeste.\"\n\"It is basically a glorified garden shed,\" says Geoff Allan. He says it is more of a lunch stop than an overnight destination.\nInside there is a small table and chair and a long wooden bench that is not really wide enough to lie on.\nThere is room on the floor for three people to sleep very closely together.\nThe cabin sits in woodland in Wester Ross.\n\"If I was to recommend a bothy to someone in the pub I'd say 'go to Peanmeanach',\" says Geoff Allan.\nIf you take the Mallaig road from Fort William you will pass the Ardnish peninsula.\nPeanmeanach is located on a raised beach on a rugged headland.\n\"It is relatively easy to get to,\" says the author.\n\"It's in its own little raised beach. There is just something about it.\n\"It has all of the best west coast magic. There is very little to do other than just go to the bothy so you just tune out and escape.\"\nThis is one of the most famous bothies looked after by the MBA.\nIt lies south of An Teallach, one of the most well-known Munros in an area of mountains called \"The Great Wilderness\".\nIt sits on the edge of Fisherfield Forest. \"It is amazing scenery,\" says Geoff Allan. \"It is busy during the summer. Best to take a tent, just in case.\"\nLots of the bothies have long histories. So Geoff Allan has chosen the oldest settlement.\nThere was a crofting township which was cleared in the 1700s and there was a shepherd's cottage built in the 1840s.\n\"Before all that there was an archaeological dig nearby which dated the settlement back 7,500 years, to the Middle Stone age,\" says Geoff Allan.\n\"There is a seam of jade close to the bothy called Bloodstone and people would come and mine it make it into ornaments and tools. It is one of the oldest settlements in Scotland.\"\nEast of Oban, high above on Loch Etive's west shore, there is a bothy that inspired one of Scottish folk singer Dougie Maclean's songs.\nGeoff Allan says Maclean's grandfather was brought up in the cottage.\nThe songwriter wrote the lyrics: \"Standing here on Cadderlie, between the burn and the turning sea,\n\"I gaze across at these golden hills, I'm looking all the way to eternity.\"\nUntil the 1700s there was a good-sized crofting community here but it dwindled following the Highland Clearances.\nThe current bothy is probably not much more than 100 years old and was used to house shepherds and their families.\nThis bothy is in the Scottish Borders, not commonly thought of as a bothy area. It is located in Eskdalemuir, close to the Samye Ling Tibetan monastery.\n\"It is very peaceful,\" says Geoff Allan.\nAn obvious \"Romantic\" place is An Cladach, says Geoff Allan.\n\"There is Islay and there is whisky. There is a wee bothy .\n\"Only half of it was rebuilt. It is just 20 yards from the Sound of Jura. It has got two double bunk beds. It is very well equipped with a library and a fireplace.\n\"If you get that to yourself it is a very romantic spot.", "summary": ".", "id": "39205436", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The Scottish Bothy Bible is a guide to 80 of the most remote and beautiful bothies in Scotland.\n\"It is a guide to the best bothies in Scotland.

And the greatest number of years that he was in prison - 18 out of 27 - were spent on Robben Island, where the contrast could not have been greater.\nBanishment\nThe notorious island, within sight of the city of Cape Town and Table Mountain, acquired its name from the seals that once populated it in multitudes - robben being the Dutch word for seal.  Its three centuries as a prison island and a place of banishment were punctuated by a period as a leper colony.\nA warder's first words when Nelson Mandela and his ANC comrades arrived were:  \"This is the Island. This is where you will die.\"\nThey faced a harsh regime in a new cell block constructed for political prisoners. Each had a single cell some seven foot square around a concrete courtyard, with a slop bucket. To start with, they were allowed no reading materials.\nThey crushed stones with a hammer to make gravel and were made to work in a blindingly bright quarry digging out the limestone.\nFellow prisoner Walter Sisulu spoke of a day Nelson Mandela's emerging leadership among the inmates was displayed in a rebellion over the quarry: \"The prison authorities would rush us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6'Hardloop!'  That means run. One day they did it with us. It was Nelson who said: 'Comrades let's be slower than ever.' It was clear therefore that the steps we were taking would make it impossible ever to reach the quarry where we were going to. They were compelled to negotiate with Nelson. That brought about the recognition of his leadership.\"\nPrisoner 46664, as he was known - the 466th prisoner to arrive in 1964 - would be the first to protest over ill-treatment and he would often be locked up in solitary as punishment.\n\"In those early years, isolation became a habit. We were routinely charged for the smallest infractions and sentenced to isolation,\" he wrote in his autobiography, The Long Walk to Freedom. \"The authorities believed that isolation was the cure for our defiance and rebelliousness.\"\n\"I found solitary confinement the most forbidding aspect of prison life. There was no end and no beginning; there is only one's own mind, which can begin to play tricks.\"\nStill, his determination and wit were clearly undiminished. His lawyer George Bizos saw it at first hand.\n\"On my first visit to Robben Island he was brought to the consulting room by no less than eight warders, two in front, two on each side and two at the back\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in shorts and without socks. And the thing that was odd about it is that, unlike any other prisoner I have ever seen, he was setting the pace at which this group was coming towards the consulting room. And then with all gravitas he said 'You know, George, this place really has made me forget my manners. I haven't introduced you to my guard of honour'.\"\nUniversity behind bars\nAfter the first few months on the island, life settled into a pattern.\n\"Prison life is about routine: each day like the one before; each week like the one before it, so that the months and years blend into each other,\" Mr Mandela wrote.\nOver time, and varying according to who was running the prison, so-called privileges would be granted. Those who wanted could apply for permission to study.\nAlthough some subjects such as politics and military history were forbidden, Robben Island became known as a \"university behind bars\".\nANC and Communist Party stalwart Mac Maharaj remembers it as a cause of a falling out with Nelson Mandela.\n\"He was urging let us study Afrikaans and I was saying no way - this is the language of the damn oppressor. He persuaded me by saying,' Mac, we are in for a protracted war. You can't dream of ambushing the enemy if you can't understand the general commanding the forces. You have to read their literature and poetry, you have to understand their culture so that you get into the mind of the general.'\n\"Here he was showing right at the outset this focus of thinking of the other side, understanding them, anticipating them and so at the end of the day understanding how to accommodate them.\"\nWhen Nelson Mandela reflected on his Robben Island experiences on returning there in 1994 he said: \"Wounds that can't be seen are more painful than those that can be seen and cured by a doctor. One of the saddest moments of my life in prison was the death of my mother. The next shattering experience was the death of my eldest son in a car accident.\" He was refused permission to attend either funeral.\nNelson Mandela's letters from prison to his second wife Winnie are poignant in the way they show the price paid for his total immersion in the anti-apartheid struggle, as is her account of this period.\nLeft to raise their children alone, Winnie once described the impact of taking them to see him in prison: \"Taking them at that age to their father - their father of that stature - was so traumatic. It was one of the most painful moments actually. And I could see the strain on my children both before their visit and for quite some time after they had some contact with their father.\"\nWar of attrition\nBy the time Nelson Mandela was moved to Pollsmoor prison on the mainland, he was the world's most famous but perhaps least recognisable political prisoner. No contemporary photograph of him had been seen for years.\nThe late anti-apartheid activist Amina Cachalia, who had known him well before he went into prison, visited him. She told me she had taken a small camera into the prison with her, and as they had lunch she reached for her bag and said she was going to take a picture of him.\nHe held her by the arm and shook his head. She said Nelson Mandela was afraid they would confiscate the camera and terminate the visit.\nAmina Cachalia laughed at the thought of the impact her photograph would have had. \"He deprived me of being a millionairess,\" she joked.\nFellow prisoner Ahmed Kathrada recalled that in Pollsmoor in 1985, Nelson Mandela was called to the prison office and then returned to his ANC colleagues and started reading the newspapers.  After a few minutes he said to them: \"Oh by the way chaps, I was told President Botha has offered to release us.\"\n\"After 20 years or more of us being in prison and that's how cool he was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 'By the way this has happened',\" Mr Kathrada told me. \"We didn't even have to mull over it and that very night he wrote the letter. We all read through it and signed it, rejecting the offer.\"\nEven though later Nelson Mandela was to have many meetings with the government and to be moved to the more comfortable conditions of his villa at Victor Verster prison - attending Sunday services, playing chess, teaching political economy to his fellow prisoners - he always sought to give the ANC exiled leadership no cause to be suspicious of his intentions and refused to put his own freedom before that of others and before the goals of the movement.\nAhmed Kathrada told me that Nelson Mandela fought a war of attrition in everything. In prison, he once played chess against a medical student who had just come in for five years.\n\"They played for many hours in one day and they had to ask the warders to lock the chessboard up in the cell next door. They continued the next day and each move was so slow this was a war of attrition. After a few hours the young chap said 'Look, you win. Just take your victory.'

known as Putonghua, some in Hong Kong are losing interest, or even downright refusing to speak it.\nChan Shui-duen, a professor of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said that among some of her students, speaking Putonghua can almost be taboo.\n\"Especially among young people, the overall standard of Putonghua is rising,\" she said. \"But some of them just reject it.\"\nThis is because, for many, Putonghua has become an unwelcome reminder of the increasing \"mainlandisation\" of Hong Kong.\nThe social rejection of Putonghua has come as people question their Chinese identity, which has alarmed both the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments.\nLast June, an annual poll by the University of Hong Kong found that only 31% of people said they felt proud to be Chinese nationals, a significant drop from the year before, and a record low since the survey first began in 1997.\nEven as resentment against Putonghua builds, there is grudging awareness that - with nearly one billion speakers in the world - fluency in the language may hold the key to wealth and success in Hong Kong.\nWhen my eldest child turned two, I started looking for a suitable kindergarten.\nIt surprised me that the most sought-after schools in Hong Kong taught in English or Mandarin, rather than Cantonese, which is the default language for nearly the entire population.\nAnd I was shocked to hear from Ruth Benny, founder of the Hong Kong-based education consultancy Top Schools, that 99% of her clients, both local and expatriate, strongly preferred Mandarin.\n\"I believe Cantonese is not valued in the context of formal education much at all,\" said Ruth Benny, the Hong Kong-based founder of Top Schools.\nShe said Cantonese families are happy for their children to be \"socially fluent,\" but preferred them to learn Chinese literacy in Mandarin, with a standard form of written Chinese.\nThe rising educational preference for Mandarin at the expense of Cantonese is causing anger and anxiety among Hong Kong residents, 20 years after the city was handed back from the UK to China.\nThey worry the city's distinctive culture and identity will eventually be subsumed by mainland China, with some questioning if the language - and the city so closely identified with it - is dying.\nBefore the 1997 handover, most local schools in Hong Kong officially used English as the medium of instruction, but in practice also taught in Cantonese.\nMandarin, also known as Putonghua, was introduced in schools in the 1980s and only became a core part of the curriculum in 1998.\nCantonese is believed to have originated after the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220AD, when long periods of war caused northern Chinese to flee south, taking their ancient language with them.\nMandarin was documented much later in the Yuan Dynasty in 14th century China. It was later popularised across China by the Communist Party after taking power in 1949.\n\"As expected, after the handover, Putonghua became more privileged and popular,\" said Brian Tse, a professor of education at the University of Hong Kong.\nBy 1999, the Education Bureau had started publicising its long-term goal of adopting Putonghua, not Cantonese, as the medium of instruction in Chinese classes, even though it offered no timetable on when this should be achieved.\nAbout a decade later, the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (Scolar), a government advisory group, announced plans to give $26m to schools to switch to Putonghua for Chinese teaching.\nIt said a maximum of 160 schools could join the scheme over four years.\nCantonese concern groups estimate that 70% of all primary schools and 25% of secondary schools now use Putonghua to teach Chinese.\nOfficially, the city government encourages students to become bi-literate in Chinese and English and trilingual in English, Cantonese and Mandarin.\nBut Robert Bauer, a Cantonese expert who teaches at several universities in Hong Kong, said Scolar and the Education Bureau were essentially \"bribing\" schools to make the switch from Cantonese to Mandarin as the medium of instruction in Chinese language classes.\n\"They're taking orders from the people of Beijing,\" he said. \"Cantonese sets Hong Kong apart from the mainland. The Chinese government hates that, and so does the Hong Kong government.\"\nThose who support this view point to a gaffe made by the Education Bureau in 2014.\nOn its site detailing Hong Kong's language policy, it stated that Cantonese was a \"Chinese dialect that is not an official language\".\nIt caused an outcry, as Hong Kong residents certainly believe theirs is a proper form of Chinese, and not just a dialect.  The bureau was forced to apologise and delete the phrase.\nIn 1997, there was hope and expectation that the city, unlike the rest of China, would soon enjoy universal suffrage.\nBut the Chinese government's interpretation of reform angered the public.\nTens of thousands of people took to the streets in unprecedented protests in 2014.\nThe reform proposal was vetoed by pro-democracy politicians in 2015, and today, Hong Kong seems stuck in a political stalemate.\nAgainst this backdrop, Cantonese has not just survived but thrived in a totally unexpected way, according to linguistics expert Lau Chaak-ming.\nStarting about 10 years ago, writing in vernacular Cantonese, in addition to standard Chinese, began appearing in public in advertisements.\nMr Lau said this trend has greatly accelerated in the past four years.\n\"We can now use our language in the written form,\" he told me proudly.\nPreviously, advertisements and newspapers used only standard written Chinese, which is easily comprehensible to all Chinese-literate readers, whereas non-Cantonese speakers might struggle to understand the written vernacular.\n898m\nSpeak Mandarin\n73m\nSpeak Cantonese\nMr Lau dates the rise in written Cantonese to greater awareness of a local Cantonese identity, as opposed to a more general Chinese sense of self.\nMr Lau and a number of volunteers are compiling an online Cantonese dictionary, documenting its evolution.\nWorking in parallel, Mr Bauer, the Cantonese expert, will soon be publishing a Cantonese-English dictionary, which will be available online and in book form.\nAccording to these experts, Cantonese isn't dying at all. For now.\n\"From a linguistic point of view, it's not endangered at all. It's doing quite well compared to other languages in the China region,\" said Mr Lau.\nBut he and others worry about the long-term consequences of the rise of Putonghua in Hong Kong, especially as more schools seem to be keen to teach in the medium.\n\"Speaking, and writing, Cantonese has now become an political act,\" said Robert Bauer. \"If present trends continue, children are not going to speak Cantonese down the road. It will become endangered.\"\nHe cited the history of Cantonese in Guangdong province, where he believes efforts to spread Putonghua have been too successful, with children now not using their mother tongue.\nBut Ms Chan of Hong Kong Polytechnic is less pessimistic.\nContrary to what had been predicted, she says, Cantonese has maintained, and even extended, its dominant position after the handover in the areas of politics and law.\nIt has been \"transmuted\", she maintains, from a low-status dialect to a high-status form that displays all the full functions of a standard language - which is something quite unique and unprecedented in the Chinese context.\nCantonese may not entirely enjoy the \"prestige\" of a national language, but it is quite important - and indispensible for anyone living and working in Hong Kong.", "summary": "When Hong Kong was handed back from the UK to China in 1997, only a quarter of the population spoke any Mandarin.", "id": "40406429", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nCantonese is a dialect of Chinese, but it is not a standard language.\nCantonese is a dialect of Chinese, but it is a standard language.\nCantonese is a dialect of Chinese, but it is not a standard language.

Shale can eventually metamorphose to slate.\nOver a few years since commercial operations began at scale, shale gas has helped consumer gas prices in the US to fall by about a third; it's offered gas security to the US and Canada for maybe 100 years; and it's presented an opportunity to generate electricity at half the CO2 emissions of coal.\nShale gas has also been accused of poisoning water supplies, killing livestock, destabilising the landscape and of sucking investment from the renewable technologies said to be vital for combating climate change.\nThe industry vigorously denies that shale gas is unsafe - and blames pollution incidents as examples of bad practice, rather than an inherently risky technique.\nAnd the technique of smashing the gas out of shale is certainly impressive.\nConventional gas-bearing rocks like sandstone and limestone are porous - so if you bore into a gas-bearing seam the pressure difference brings the gas flowing to the surface.\nNot shale, though. Its clay particles traps gas molecules so tight that it's been impossible to extract commercially until engineers combined existing technologies of horizontal drilling and \"fracking\".\nI visited Shell's shale operations drilling in the Louisiana forests to see the operation first hand.\nThey're tapping part of the Haynesville field which has made millionaires out of landowners in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas and has helped insulate these states from the recession. The field contains an estimated 20-30 trillion cubic feet of gas.\nPhase one involves a drilling a nine-inch hole 12,382 ft down, then turning a five-inch bore horizontally for 4,389ft along the shale seam.\nThen the rig is removed, and the frack team arrives. They feed a \"perf gun\" down the bore. It's a steel tube packed with a string of explosives that blow holes the width of  a fine knitting needle 18 inches into the surrounding shale.\nThen the perf gun is withdrawn and 16 massive trucks move in. Together they generate 7,800 psi  pressure to force a mixture of fine sand, water and lubricant chemicals into the bore. The sand blasts into the piercings in the shale and jams open crevices so the gas can find its way into the bore.\nPhase three is to remove almost all the equipment leaving just a few bits of kit in the cleared square in the forest. Production from this incongruously modest installation will peak over the first two years but will keep drawing out shale gas for decades.\n\"Shale gas is a once-in-a-century opportunity,\" Shell's Russ Ford told me. \"It's giving north America energy security from imports, it's offering a lower-carbon fuel, and it's creating jobs.\" He estimates that shale will be providing 20% of US gas by 2020, and more thereafter.\nBut there are several controversies over environmental impacts. Some geologists fear that fracking may destabilise the ground. Then, when the drillers plunge through aquifers - water-bearing rocks supplying homes - they must seal the borehole so water doesn't leak in and waste doesn't leak out. If this isn't done right, there's trouble.\nSome of the fracking water injected into the well gets absorbed by the shale. But some burps back contaminated with chemicals and has to be disposed of as hazardous.\nAt Shell's site in Louisiana it's injected under licence into exhausted deep gas fields sealed off from the surface by impervious layers of rock.\nBut not far from here in Shreveport cows were killed at an American firm's gas site after drinking frack water that had belched up to the surface.\nHomes were evacuated when methane escaped uncontrollably from a well-head. And a documentary, Gaslands, shows extraordinary scenes of householders in New York State running taps with well water so laced with methane that they can set light to the gas in the sink.\nSome of the gas operations are close to major population centres, and many people are angry that firms say the chemicals in fracking are a commercial secret. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is investigating shale gas extraction and expects to report in 2012.\nA spokesman from the US Environmental Protection agency told us:  \"There are serious concerns about whether the process of hydraulic fracturing impacts drinking water, human health and the environment and further study is warranted. We will make every effort to produce a final report as swiftly as possible.\"\nThe gas firms have half an eye on the electoral calendar as the head of the EPA is a political appointment. Gas states tend to be Republican whilst coal states tend to vote for Democrats. So politics might play a part in how tightly shale gas is regulated.\nShale gas is just one of three types of booming \"unconventional\" gas supplying America with what the gasmen call \"indigenous molecules\".\n\"Tight gas\" previously trapped in sandstone can now be harvested by fracking and there's also a rush to suck methane out of coal beds.\nUS gas prices have dropped about 50% over the past few years, partly thanks to the recession but partly thanks to America's sigh of relief that it won't need to import much gas.\nSome terminals built to import liquid natural gas are now being converted to exports.\nThe boom in unconventional gas looks to be globally significant. With the US no longer seeking imports, the pressure is off international prices. China is also believed to have very large deposits of unconventional gas. Poland, Germany, Holland and even the UK may have commercially viable deposits.\nEurope will still import gas from Russia, but every unconventional gas development erodes Moscow's role as energy superpower.\nDr Manouchehr Takin from the Centre for Global Energy Studies said: \"Shale gas is definitely a phenomenon. Shale is deposited all round the world and we can expect there to be shale gas reserves in many many countries, although it's not clear yet how much will be commmercially viable.\n\"It will depend on how much organic material has been laid down with the shale and how much gas has already escaped.  It is going to allow almost every country a degree of energy independence.\"\nDr Takin points out that shale gas is currently a victim of its own success, having forced down US gas prices to a point where it's no longer economic. But demand will surge back, he predicts.\nThe gas may have an impact on energy policies worldwide. In the UK, for instance, energy policy offers incentives for nuclear and wind to promote low-carbon growth but also to avoid dependency on \"unreliable\" gas supplies.\nUnconventional gas is making those supplies more reliable, and some firms may press for a greater role for gas, which is more polluting than renewables but cheaper and more flexible.\nThe other impact may be on investment patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) identifies a major shortfall in capital for renewables.\nThere is finite energy cash globally, and some big firms seeking assured profits are already switching their investment from offshore wind farms - untested in the long term - to those familiar hydrocarbon molecules emerging from unfamiliar places.", "summary": "There's a damp chill in the Louisiana bayou as dawn casts a pink light on the swamp cypresses festooned in moss.", "id": "12018009", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.\tThe shale gas boom is a global phenomenon. 2.\tThe shale gas boom is a victim of its own success. 3.\tThe shale gas boom is making gas supplies more reliable. 4.\tThe shale gas boom is making gas supplies more reliable. 5.\tThe shale gas boom is making gas supplies more reliable. 6.\tThe shale gas boom is making gas supplies more", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe US is the world's largest consumer of energy, and the world's largest producer of oil and gas.\nThe US is also the world's largest importer of oil, and the world's largest exporter of gas.\nThe US is the world's largest importer of coal, and the world's largest exporter of coal.\nThe US is the world's largest importer of uranium, and the world's largest exporter", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "the US is the world's largest consumer of oil, and China is the world's largest consumer of coal.\nThe US is also the world's largest producer of coal, and China is the world's largest producer of gas.\nThe US is also the world's largest producer of gas, and China is the world's largest producer of gas.\nThe US is also the world's largest producer of gas, and China is the world's largest producer of", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nThe IEA says that the world is not ready for the impact of shale gas.\nThe IEA says that the world is not ready for the impact of shale gas.\nThe IEA says that the world is not ready for the impact of shale gas.\nThe IEA says that the world is not ready for the impact of shale gas.\nThe IEA says that the world is not ready for the impact of shale gas.\nThe IEA says", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe shale gas boom is a global phenomenon.\nThe shale gas boom is a victim of its own success.\nThe shale gas boom is a victim of its own success.\nThe shale gas boom is a victim of its own success.\nThe shale gas boom is a victim of its own success.\nThe shale gas boom is a victim of its own success.\nThe shale gas boom is a victim of its", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe IEA says that the world needs to invest $1 trillion a year in renewables to meet the challenge of climate change.\nThe IEA says that the world needs to invest $1 trillion a year in renewables to meet the challenge of climate change.\nThe IEA says that the world needs to invest $1 trillion a year in renewables to meet the challenge of climate change.\nThe IEA says that the world needs to invest $1", "decode_al_1_be_12_lay_2": "the IEA.\nThe IEA says that the world is not short of hydrocarbons, but it is short of hydrocarbon energy.\nThe IEA says that the world is not short of hydrocarbons, but it is short of hydrocarbon energy.\nThe IEA says that the world is not short of hydrocarbons, but it is short of hydrocarbon energy.\nThe IEA says that the world is not short of hydrocarb", "decode_al_15_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe shale gas boom is a global phenomenon.

In truth, had they scored 14 then Motherwell could scarcely have raised an objection.\nIf there was any doubt as to what kind of performance Celtic could find on Deila's last day then it was answered early and emphatically.\nEven before they opened the scoring midway through the first half, they created a long series of decent chances.\nRogic went close on three different occasions, Christie had two opportunities and Lustig one.\nFrom the get-go, Celtic had a dynamism about them that Motherwell couldn't even get close to living with.\nSure, it was a match with nothing at stake, but there was a tempo and an accuracy about their game that was exhilarating.\nIn the absence of midfielders Scott Brown and Nir Bitton, they had the brake off and they were relentless.\nThe rout was started by Tierney, a fitting flourish in a terrific breakthrough season for the teenage left-back. He cut in from the left and beat Conor Ripley at his near post.\nFive minutes later, Rogic made it two and this one had a lot to do with the excellent Armstrong, who, after playing a one-two with Christie, hit a post with his shot. Rogic was on hand to tap in the loose ball.\nThe home fans had barely retaken their seats when it was three. An Armstrong corner was missed by the flapping Ripley and was headed home at the back post by Lustig.\nMotherwell knew what was coming next - waves and waves of green and white. When they had the ball, they couldn't keep it. When they didn't have it, they didn't have a clue how to get it.\nThey were utterly bamboozled by Celtic's energy and should have been four behind before the break when Ripley tipped a Rogic shot into Christie's air-space. The former Inverness Caledonian Thistle youngster had to score but put it over, much to his embarrassment.\nNot that it mattered because Celtic continued the deconstruction just after the break, Armstrong teeing himself up with a nice first touch and an even nicer second one, a delicious hit into Ripley's top corner.\nCeltic Park lapped up this ruthless version of a team they have seen toil too often this season - a fast-moving, creative force that refused to ease Motherwell's torture.\nThe visitors were like sitting ducks. This was a feeble and mortifying end to their season.\nThe fifth came quickly, Armstrong's good work starting it and Roberts' curling finish ending it. Motherwell backed off him and duly got what they deserved.\nFour minutes later, the sixth arrived, Rogic playing Christie through and this time he made no mistake, drilling his shot past the hopelessly isolated, and totally befuddled, Ripley.\nThe great feel-good goal was the last one, though. Aitchison, born in 2000, slammed home his first shot on goal in senior football, a strike that will live forever in his memory no matter how many he goes on to score at this level.\nFor Deila, it was the perfect send-off. As the supporters of his soon-to-be former club celebrated the title into the night, the manager would be on a flight out of Glasgow, back to Norway, back to the life he had before he entered the mad world of Scottish football.\nAfter this rout, he would have left with a smile.

I was playing basketball and my ankle just went off like a firework.\nThat was very painful, but it wasn't close to what happened next. I got to the hospital and the last little bit of tendon that was attaching my calf muscle to my ankle popped, so my entire calf muscle rolled up behind my knee. No pain in this lifetime will compare. It was so severe that I actually passed out.\nWhat will happen to America after the election?\nOh my God. My grandfather was born in the 1930s and he says this is the worst election he's seen in his lifetime.\nI don't think either candidate is the devil. If you're voting experience, Hillary clearly wins because you get two presidents for the price of one - her and Bill. But then you have all the trust issues. Trump, I don't even have to go into detail on why that's scary.\nBut I'll say this: The future still looks good because of the checks and balances system we have. If Trump gets in, he's going to get stonewalled.\nWhat's the best thing about being a father?\nEverything is the best thing about being a father. When our youngest kid sees me, he lights up like a Christmas tree. It's love on another level. Rare is the person you would throw yourself in front of a moving car for, but kids bring that out in you.\nDo you have a recurring nightmare?\nI've had one since college. It's the last week of school, and I get a call from a professor saying, \"You didn't come to my class once this entire semester and I'm failing you, so you're not going to graduate\".\nYou know why I have that dream? Because that actually happened. I was enrolled on a physical education course, but I didn't know and I missed every lesson. The guy said the only way he'd pass me was if I came in the next three days in a row, and ran two miles, then three miles, then five miles. And I had to do each one in a certain time. The three-mile race I had to do in 22 minutes, so a seven-minute mile, and I almost died.\nAfter I did it, the guy looked at me and he shook his head, and he said, \"You're lucky you're in decent shape because I was ready to fail you\".\nYou grew up in Tulsa which is a big oil city. Are you for or against fossil fuels?\nWhen I first made money from Apologise and Bleeding Love, I wanted to buy a solar panel farm. I was immediately looking into that as an investment strategy. I've invested in Elon Musk's [solar panel company] SolarCity and Tesla. I refuse to believe we live on a planet that doesn't have 100% renewable resources.\nI don't like to invest in bonds and mutual funds, so you have to find something, whether it's a streaming service or a green technology service, or a cancer-fighting company, and invest early. I'll cold call them and be like, \"Hey, you're developing an early-detection cancer system, what would it take to invest in your company?\".\nIs it possible for a songwriter to improve with age?\nThat's a really interesting question. In Nashville, there's a much greater likelihood that you can continue to have hits in your 50s and 60s.\nThe only pop writer I can name in the whole world who has continued to have true hits is Billy Steinberg [Madonna's Like A Virgin, The Bangles' Eternal Flame]. He still understands the craft and melody. And the key is collaboration. You have to have youth injected into your sphere.\nSo I'd say it's possible, but unlikely.\nWhat was the key ingredient in the conception of this album?\nFriends. Ed Sheeran influenced a few songs in terms of how I approached the lyrics. Bono made me question everything, try and beat every lyric, be more brutal.\nBut I have a couple of guy friends who are in their early 30s and they don't care about pop music. Those guys give me the best feedback. Their response means more to me than anyone.\nHave you had your hands insured?\nI'm not Elton John, I've never thought of insuring my hands! But if we're in the middle of a tour I'm not really supposed to ski. Our tour insurance policy forbids it.\nWho is your most famous neighbour?\nI have two. On my left is Hedi Slimane, the fashion designer, and my other next-door neighbour is Mark Hoppus from Blink 182.\nOur other neighbours are the Clintons' doctors. So at least twice a year our entire cul-de-sac gets shut down. The Clintons will come over and you have to go through secret service to get to your own house.\nWhat's the first thing you do when you arrive in a new city?\nI look for the best coffee shop in the city. I get online the night before and I Google coffee shops and then I read reviews on Yelp. Then I'll go and look at photos of them - because I'm a total nerd. I do this in every city. And I mean every city: Belgrade, Bucharest, Auckland, Moscow.\nWill I write a book? Maybe. I have all the notes stored in my phone.\nIf your house burned down, what's the one thing you'd save, apart from your family?\nI would say the documents that I've collected. I have handwritten letters from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. I have one of the last remaining photographs of Lincoln before he died. I have a hand-drafted letter from Napoleon while he was at the peak of his power, with the seal of Italy. I've got a photo of the first flight taking off in Kitty Hawk, signed by Orville Wright. I have coins that were minted in 2 AD in Jerusalem, as Christ was literally walking through the streets.\nThey're all in the same area of my house and they're mostly wood and paper, so I'd be sprinting to those with a blanket, and I'd grab them and run out the door. The Grammys can burn.\nDo you read your own press?\nSometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It literally depends on the mood.\nMy issue with critics is\u2026 it's funny\u2026 I read a negative review of us a few years ago and I was like, \"I need to know more about this guy because he's speaking as though he wouldn't like us if we were the last band on earth\". So I go and look at who he likes, and he just went to a Black Sabbath concert, he loves Megadeth, he thinks Arcade Fire is \"too pop\".

We couldn't break up play in midfield, then the opposition counter-attacked and scored. We had chances in the first half, but we couldn't take them.\"\nTurkey coach Fatih Terim: \"If we advance, we can do what we did in Euro 2008, because our confidence is growing now. We still have some problems but now it's easier to find some solutions. We have a good side and now we have our team spirit back. Everybody was involved. If we advance, I think we will have a long way to go.\"\nTurkey forward Burak Yilmaz: \"Many things were written and said about us. We're the players, but we are not asked about our thoughts and feelings. People comment on us without knowing what's going on in the squad.

The Best There Was And The Best There Will Ever Be\".\nGerrard came out to warm up ahead of his team-mates, who allowed him to take the acclaim of The Kop - and in the moments before kick-off Anfield was united in tribute to the man many regard as Liverpool's finest.\nHe emerged with his daughters Lourdes, Lexie and Lilly-Ella through a guard of honour formed by both sides as thunderous roars swept around Anfield.\nThe kick-off actually dampened the atmosphere, Liverpool taking an undeserved lead after 26 minutes when Lallana was the beneficiary of Martin Kelly's poor ball, running on and beating Wayne Hennessey with an accomplished finish.\nPalace, however, continued to be the better side and were full value for the equaliser that came two minutes before half-time, Puncheon sending a 20-yard free-kick beyond Simon Mignolet after Emre Can fouled the dangerous Yannick Bolasie.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPardew decided to introduce Zaha to add to Palace's attacking threat - and it was a move that paid dividends as he slid in Bolasie's cross with his first touch after just 23 seconds on the pitch.\nAs Liverpool's defence rocked, the outstanding Bolasie almost extended their advantage when he cut inside the struggling Martin Skrtel, but struck his shot against the bar.\nThere was to be no final rescue act from Gerrard and substitute Murray secured Palace's win by putting in the rebound from his own penalty, which was initially saved by Mignolet.\nThe spot kick was awarded after Lucas fouled Zaha - although it looked as though the first contact was outside the box.\nIt was then time for Gerrard to take his leave - and for Liverpool to ponder how they can possibly fill the gap he leaves behind.\nMatch ends, Liverpool 1, Crystal Palace 3.\nSecond Half ends, Liverpool 1, Crystal Palace 3.\nCorner,  Liverpool.

By the latest estimate from the UK Space Agency's education specialists, at least one million pupils in British schools have been involved in his projects so far.\nAnd, because a detailed analysis has yet to be done, the total may in reality be far higher.\nSome 30 projects ranging from fitness challenges to computer coding to amateur radio hook-ups made up what ranks as the largest public engagement exercise for any Esa astronaut.\nTake the Rocket Science scheme: about 8,600 packets of seeds from rocket plants were sent to thousands of schools and other academic institutions reaching more than 600,000 children.\nHalf the packets contained seeds that had spent six months in space, the other half held seeds that had stayed on the ground - and in classrooms across the country pupils are cultivating the plants to see if there's a difference.\nLibby Jackson of the UK Space Agency says the exercise allows teachers to explain some key principles in research such as blind trials and randomisation, and to emphasise the importance of sustainability in food production.\n\"Add space as the context and it makes it all the more exciting,\" she says. \"The enthusiasm has been fantastic.\"\nThen there were live link-ups in which Tim, floating in front of an ISS camera, could speak directly to children themselves.\nThe Cosmic Classroom saw lucky kids gathered for an event in Liverpool but a further 400,000 watched a webcast, and all of them had a chance of posing questions.\nAt the same time, special exhibitions called Destination Space were staged at 20 science centres around the country and some 350,000 have attended so far to learn about Tim's mission.\nWill any of this make a difference to the number of children choosing to study the STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics?\nThe first test will come in September when schools see who confirms for those classes but it will take many years to get a genuinely reliable answer, particularly for a sense of how many then go on into STEM careers.\nIn the first research of its kind, a team from University of York will attempt to investigate this over the coming years - looking at whether there really will be a \"Tim Peake effect\" like the \"Apollo effect\" in which the Moon landings fired up a whole generation.\nLibby Jackson says the anecdotal evidence of a positive response is already clear, and she adds: \"I haven't met a teacher or parent who hasn't said it's all great - I think the numbers engaged in Tim's mission will be staggeringly high.\"\nAnd that engagement will not end with his return. While 650 primary schools used Peake-related materials in their teaching this year, the total next year will be 750 - and excitement will surely build as Tim tours the country on his return.\nSo what about Tim's involvement in the science on the space station?\nBy their very nature, the 250 experiments under way tend to be long-running so no single astronaut will ever have a pivotal role in them during their time on board, let alone be able to claim a 'eureka' discovery.\nBut Tim has done his bit in a wide range of projects, some relevant to people on Earth, others aimed at future space missions, including allowing his own body to be used in a range of medical experiments. A good question would be to ask how many blood samples he's taken.\nHe took part in an airway study in which his exhalations were monitored for nitric oxide which may be an indicator of internal inflammation - relevant to asthma sufferers on Earth and to future astronauts visiting the dusty environments of the Moon or Mars.\nHe worked on an investigation of metal alloys in which samples are heated to 2000C and levitated - a technique, impossible back here, which avoids any risk of contamination from the container holding the experiment.\nHe helped to study the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and degrade with ageing. These appear to grow differently in microgravity, so samples have been cultivated in a growth medium and will be analysed back on the ground.\nBy remote control, he steered a robotic rover in a simulated Martian terrain in Stevenage to test how future astronauts could guide robots and work in tandem with them.\nAnd packed beneath Tim's seat for the return trip are samples of bacteria which were positioned on the outside of the ISS, a project run by the Open University and Edinburgh University to explore the limits of where life can survive.\nProf Mike Cruise, who heads Esa's human spaceflight science advisory committee, told me that while \"you can't unpick the role of any individual person\", Tim had \"exceeded expectations\" and that his \"personal authority\" had helped to reach people who would not normally be interested in science.\nFinally, what has Tim Peake's mission done to highlight Britain's space industry, worth at least \u00c2\u00a310bn, but often operating without much public or political attention?\nAccording to Lord Willetts, a former science minister, Tim has been \"a brilliant ambassador\" and he says \"his flight has achieved more than we dared hope\".\nIt was David Willetts, at a crucial Esa meeting in 2012, who skilfully negotiated a relatively minor role for Britain in the agency's human spaceflight programme which helped secure Tim's mission.\n\"It's hard to measure, but I believe Tim has given Britain some real confidence that we are a serious player in space. People didn't recognise that we design satellites and instruments for Mars and beyond, that a Mars rover is being built in Britain.\"\nThe hope will be that further big industrial orders will follow, boosting the scale and ambition of the space projects undertaken here.\nFor decades, successive governments had shown no interest in sending people into space - the first Brit to make it, Helen Sharman, flew with the Russians after winning a competition.\nDavid Willetts is among those hoping that Tim's flight will not be the last. Like many, he's become an enthusiast, seeing the fervour whipped up among children and the value of having a glamorous standard-bearer for a potentially vast industry.\nAnd the excitement is infectious. A few weeks ago, walking along a corridor in the House of Lords, his mobile rang. It was a Houston number. Tim Peake, hurtling 250 miles above the planet, was calling for a chat.\nA British astronaut was ringing a peer in Parliament - without any formal Cabinet decision or public discussion, we have suddenly become a spacefaring nation.\nThe question is whether other missions will follow. And that depends on the strength of the Tim Peake effect, and whether it's enough to convince ministers to keep paying.\nTim Peake in space:\nSpecial report page: For the latest news, analysis and video\nGuide: A day in the life of an astronaut\nExplainer:  The journey into space and back\nTest yourself: Do you have what it takes to be an astronaut?\nTimeline: How Tim Peake became a British astronaut\nQuiz: How dangerous is life in space?\nHighlights: Scenes from the trip in video", "summary": "Tim Peake grabbed the headlines for blazing a trail as Britain's first government-funded astronaut but it's fair to ask what his six months in space have actually achieved.", "id": "36537646", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nTim Peake's mission to the International Space Station has been a huge success.\nThe British astronaut has been a brilliant ambassador for the UK and for science.\nHis mission has helped to highlight Britain's space industry, worth at least \u00c2\u00a310bn, but often operating without much public or political attention.\nTim Peake's mission to the International Space Station has been a huge success.

This was a message that did not get across amid the tedium of the first hour.\nThe build-up was, on too many occasions, slow motion, good positions were wasted too often and, while Harry Kane's confidence has clearly taken a hit, this top-class striker cannot live in splendid isolation at international level. He, like most strikers, needs support and service.\nSlovakia stood firm against England in Euro 2016 and they looked like doing it again here until Lallana's persistence and willingness to try a shot paid off in those last seconds.\nIn future, preferably swiftly and during the course of this qualifying campaign, Allardyce must uncover an X-factor to ensure frustrating nights like this are eradicated.\nEngland have attempted 49 shots, including blocks, in their past two matches against Slovakia and scored only once, in the dying moments of the second game.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDele Alli provided drive and danger when he came on, but the mind also wandered to what precocious Manchester United teenager Marcus Rashford might have offered.\nTrue, Rashford has not had an overload of first-team football at Old Trafford this season but he has looked at ease with England and has pace, a fearless attitude and an eye for goal. Food for thought for Allardyce?\nEverton's Ross Barkley, for now, is an outsider but is also a maverick talent that could be of use.\nHe was not given any game time by Roy Hodgson at Euro 2016 and was excluded from Allardyce's first squad - perhaps paying the price because his tactical discipline is still a work in progress.\nAllardyce's work has barely started but this was a performance that will have told him England need to find more unpredictability and threat to avoid being thwarted by the sort of organisation and resilience Slovakia showed here in Trnava.\nAllardyce has made no secret of the fact managing England would be the pinnacle of his career - so to see him savour this victory was to witness one of the game's most enduring figures fulfilling the first part of a dream.\nIt was also the first chance for him to get acquainted with the task in hand and see at close quarters what he must do to cast off the shadows hanging over this England team after their harrowing experiences in France.\nAllardyce has exuded confidence and comfort in his new footballing skin here in Slovakia. He has been relaxed, humorous, but also serious about the main business. This is a task he is relishing and is not daunted by - a tough evening will not alter that.\nThe 61-year-old must now transmit some of his own iron-clad confidence and self-belief to his new players who still, understandably perhaps, looked cautious, tentative and too risk averse to let their football flow.\nAllardyce is determined to break down the psychological barrier that has blocked England for so long and he will go beyond tricks such as bringing in comedians Bradley Walsh and Paddy McGuinness to give the squad a few laughs.\nThe most confident, self-assured man around England's camp is currently the manager. The quicker he can transfer that to those under his command, the quicker the Allardyce show will really hit the road.\nAllardyce is a man and manager who revels in the image of someone who is in charge, who calls the shots.\nYet his post-match comments about captain Wayne Rooney were almost deferential to the 30-year-old, who plans to retire from international football after the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\nThe hint before the game was the experiment of using Rooney as a midfielder, as Hodgson did at Euro 2016, was over and he would be operating in more attacking positions.\nBut Rooney, who became England's most capped outfield player ahead of David Beckham as he won his 116th cap, played in a deep-lying central midfield role in a 4-1-4-1 formation from the start, spraying passes around with mixed fortunes. He was involved, but mainly on the margins.\nIt was only when Alli came on that England had threat from a position behind the striker. Rooney's role was something of a movable feast as the game went on and it was surprising to hear Allardyce more or less admit he was powerless to control this free hand.\nHe insisted it was \"not for me to say where Wayne Rooney will play\" and added: \"Wayne played wherever he wanted to. I can't stop Wayne playing there.\n\"I think that he holds a lot more experience at international football than me as an international manager. Using his experience with a team, playing as a team member, it's not for me to say where he is going to play.\"\nExcept it is.\nRooney may be able to decide where he plays in an exhibition match but the idea he can simply do what he wants is not sustainable against opposition of the highest international quality.\nHis position in the England team is a constant narrative these days but Allardyce has firmly backed him by confirming him as captain.\nHe remains a very good footballer but not necessarily as a free spirit wandering around as some sort of player without portfolio, as the manager seemed to suggest.\nAlli's cameo complicated matters and Allardyce, over time perhaps, will surely have to work out precisely where Rooney can and cannot be utilised by England.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAllardyce is not England manager because everything is well in their world. He is there because they were once again brutally exposed at a major tournament.\nFor all the talk of a new era and Allardyce's own buoyant and confident approach, criticism of \"same old England\" was premature and unfair on the new manager.\nHe picked a team to get a result in Slovakia. It was a solid, unspectacular line-up set up in a manner designed to avoid the sort of calamity that befell England against Iceland in Nice.\nAllardyce will need time and patience to put his own stamp on the team. To suggest it would happen immediately is the stuff of fantasy but he will embrace the touch of luck that brought that 95th-minute winner.\nEngland were badly wounded and in need of repair after Euro 2016. Allardyce will be convinced he can oversee that process but even his detractors will admit it is a job that will need time.\nAnd a win, any sort of win, was just how he will have wanted to begin the task.", "summary": "Sam Allardyce's reign opened with the result he desired, if not the performance, as England beat Slovakia in their opening World Cup qualifier in Trnava.", "id": "37272602", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nAllardyce has exuded confidence and comfort in his new footballing skin here in Slovakia.

Four of the five goals were exceptional.\nThere was Lallana's chest control and strike followed by a 19-pass move finished off by Coutinho. Mane then capped off an impressive debut with a goal reminiscent of his strikes at Southampton - driving at the defence before a fierce finish.\nAnd substitute Oxlade-Chamberlain then produced a delightful cameo when he dazzled the Liverpool backline and then slotted past Simon Mignolet.\nChambers' header left Liverpool wondering whether a great win would become 'what could have been' - but they hung on.\nDuring the 2013-14 season, the Gunners capitulated horribly on three occasions in the league - conceding six against Manchester City and Chelsea and five against Liverpool.\nHome fans watching must have thought it was a case of history repeating when, from 1-0 up in the first half through Walcott's drilled effort, they were 4-1 down by the 63rd minute.\nThe difference between then and now is that Arsenal are a far more potent proposition in attack, which is why the Reds were left celebrating a narrow win rather than a mauling.\nIt is the issues at the back that appear to be a perennial problem. On Sunday they were without injured senior defenders Per Mertesacker and Gabriel, while Laurent Koscielny is still not match fit after his exploits at Euro 2016.\nThat meant manager Arsene Wenger was forced to play Rob Holding, 20, a \u00a32m summer signing from Bolton, alongside Calum Chambers, 21, in central defence.\nTheir inexperience was brutally exposed by Liverpool's attack in the second half. The question is whether Wenger dips into the transfer market or waits for his senior players to return. The fans will want the former.\nThe reaction on social media was damning and who knows what his manager Jurgen Klopp was thinking.\nLiverpool's full-back Moreno had a match to forget after twice making crucial mistakes. He should have been punished by Walcott for his first - a wild lunge on the England forward inside the area which resulted in the penalty. Simon Mignolet's save bailed him out.\nHis second error was arguably more inexplicable when he allowed Walcott acres of space on the right of the box - before the England winger drilled his angled effort past the Belgian keeper.\nDerided by his own fans last season, memorably for his performance in the Europa League final, the 24-year-old Spaniard's display is surely now giving Klopp food for thought with the transfer window shutting in two weeks.\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger:\n\"We lacked experience at the back and we were physically short. Liverpool did well and we were for 15 minutes completely shocked.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWe pushed players today like Aaron Ramsey. It is an impossible situation to get players back from the Euros and prepare.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"I played a big part in the excitement of the last half-hour, because it's not allowed to celebrate the fourth goal like this with 35 minutes to go.\n\"At this moment, we switched off the machines. The game was not over. Arsenal lost, but we gave them a path back into the game.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Nothing is sure until the final whistle. Over the whole of the 90 minutes it was a deserved win.\n\"We can always score goals and we can defend much better. It's the Premier League and nothing should be easy in this league.

But the dissatisfaction of the boxing purist looks unlikely to affect the mass audience, with the bout being screened in more than 220 countries.\nThat global reach could see the record of 4.6 million pay-per-view buys - set when Mayweather beat Manny Pacquiao in 2015 - beaten.\nWatching the fight costs a minimum of \u00a320 in the UK but around \u00a375 in the US. This, added to ticket sales, merchandise and sponsorship, makes for a healthy pot. Tickets are also on sale to watch in bars on the Las Vegas strip, while more than 400 cinemas across the US will broadcast the event.\nIt all means more than $600m (\u00a3466m) could be generated, with Pacquiao-Mayweather's reported haul of around $620m in sight. Mayweather is expected to make around $300m, McGregor $100m. Not bad for 36 minutes of work or less.\nThere have been reports 'Money Man' has not taken McGregor seriously. This week 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce said only a \"cocktail of age setting in and underestimation of his opponent\" could pose any danger to the favourite.\nMayweather's father, Floyd Sr, this week told media his son had lost \"a lot\" of his ability since retiring in 2015. But a 50th career win from 50 fights would carry his son past the late Rocky Marciano's perfect 49-fight record, rounding off a dominant professional career that began after he had won bronze at the 1996 Olympics.\nBetting markets have bemused those who give McGregor no hope as his price has shortened in recent weeks. At around 10-3, the boxing debutant is actually a shorter price than many of the fighters Mayweather dealt with before retiring in 2015.\nLas Vegas is expecting more than 1,300 private jets to land before for the weekend's action and the high rollers who hit the city's famous strip traditionally bet big on Mayweather in his home city.\n\"If we continue as we are, we will rival the $50m record staked in the state of Nevada, set when Mayweather beat Pacquiao,\" said Jay Rood, who runs the sportsbook at the MGM Grand.\n\"If we get a bad result, which for us is McGregor knocking Floyd out in the first four rounds, we could lose around $20m, by far the worst boxing result in the state's history.\"\nCloser to home, one Irish bookmaker claims an individual has placed \u00a3650,000 on McGregor in a bid to win \u00a32.8m. And while we are talking betting, Mayweather has said he will tweet a picture of his betting slip when he wagers on himself.\nPackie Collins - trainer and brother of former world champion Steve: \"I've been around the game for a long time, even based in America with my brother when Marvin Hagler was fighting. I've never seen anyone train or practise as hard as Conor McGregor. I give him a chance in there.\"\nChris Eubank - former two-weight world champion: \"Everyone is underestimating the Irish spirit. They have ghost-like spirit in warfare. I've felt it. I'm still wondering now how I got beat by Steve Collins in 1995. If McGregor pulls it off it is arguably the greatest upset in history. Everything can happen, that's why I've travelled. It is not a farce.\"\nJeff Mayweather - uncle of Floyd: \"Everyone knows what this fight is about. It's about money. Conor McGregor boxed at one point in his life but didn't master it. Floyd is a master at it.\"\nGet the biggest boxing news sent straight to your device.

But the only way he could possibly win would be if Floyd Mayweather gets careless or takes a few risks or anything like that - but Floyd never does that, does he? I don't think he'll get lucky; Floyd doesn't let you get lucky.\"\nAmir Khan - former light-welterweight world champion: \"It's not only a fight for McGregor and Mayweather, it's a fight between MMA and boxing. At the moment UFC is hitting huge pay-per-view numbers in the US. It's critical for boxing Mayweather wins. I think it could turn some UFC fans back to boxing.\"\nHall of fame referee Joe Cortez, who has helped McGregor adjust to boxing rules - \"He is one of the best learners I have seen. He picked up everything so quick. I've found him to be a gentleman behind the scenes. He's a class act with his girlfriend and baby - a gentleman.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFight has met film regularly when it comes to boxing, and a McGregor win might well one day inspire a Hollywood reimagining of Saturday's action.\nThe contrasting environments in which each man has trained hark back to Rocky IV, where Rocky trains in the Siberian mountains, chopping wood and resorting to old-school training methods, while Ivan Drago works out in a state-of-the art facility.\nMayweather is the traditionalist of this pair, working out from his renowned yet simple Mayweather Boxing Gym.

TUI has denied gross failure.\nJudge Loraine-Smith ruled the Tunisian police response was \"at best shambolic and at worst cowardly\".\nOn 26 June 2015, a gunman opened fire on holidaymakers staying in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui, just north of Sousse in Tunisia, killing 30 British tourists and eight others.\nSo-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack by Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui.\n\"The simple but tragic truth in this case is that a gunman armed with a gun and grenades went to that hotel intending to kill as many tourists as he could,\" the coroner said.\nWhat exactly happened on the day?\nHow Tunisia's security changed\nHeavy security and whitewashed walls as Sousse tries to move on\nBut Kylie Hutchison, a solicitor for 22 of the families, said it was crucial that the travel industry learned from what happened in Sousse.\nShe added: \"On behalf of our clients who lost members of their family and those who suffered injuries in this terrible incident, we will now be preparing to commence civil proceedings against TUI.\"\nTUI maintained it was \"wholly erroneous\" to claim it had been neglectful and there was insufficient evidence of any gross failure.\nOfficers near the scene ran in the opposite direction to get more guns while the Islamist gunman sprayed bullets at sunbathers on the beach and threw grenades, the inquest heard.\nHe then stormed into the hotel to kill more victims.\nIt was only after an hour-long killing spree that Seifeddine Rezgui was shot dead by police.\nTunisia attack: 'He sacrificed himself'\nOne survivor's recurring nightmare\nWho were the victims?\nThere were emotional scenes in the packed courtroom of London's Royal Courts of Justice as the coroner described how each of the victims came to their death, in alphabetical order.\nThe dead were aged between 19 and 80. Among them were three generations from one family - a young man, his uncle and his grandfather.\nFamilies had wanted the coroner to consider whether neglect by holiday firm TUI or the hotel owners was a factor in their relatives' deaths.\nBut he told them he could not because the law regarding neglect did not cover tourists who voluntarily agreed to go on holiday.\nHe added that he had not found a direct and causal link between the response of armed officers in the area and the deaths.\nHe said there were a lot of \"what ifs\" around the case, and better hotel security may simply have meant more people died on the beach.\nThe only factor that might have made a difference was if the hotel guards had been armed, he added.\n\"Having reviewed the legal advice on gun law in Tunisia, it's clear this was not a realistic option,\" he said.\nIn summing up at the end of a six-week hearing, the judge said holidaymakers had been \"reassured\" about safety before booking.\nOne man said his wife had raised the March 2015 attack at the Bardo museum in the capital Tunis with a travel agent, who told her it had been a \"one-off\" and the place was \"100% safe\".\nA Thomson travel agent said she would not say somewhere was completely safe, the inquest heard.\nBy Richard Galpin, BBC News correspondent\nThe families of those killed are bound to be disappointed by the coroner's ruling that he could not include neglect in his conclusions today.\nIf he had, it would have potentially bolstered their cases when they launch personal injury and fatal accident claims against the holiday company TUI sometime over the next year.\nAll thirty British tourists killed in the attack had booked their holidays through TUI's subsidiary, Thomson.\nThe inquest had heard earlier that TUI did not carry out any security checks at the hotel where they were staying, until after the attack.\nTUI denies the allegations of neglect saying security at hotels was not its responsibility.\nThe families may latch on to what the coroner then went on to say in his summary of the evidence.\nHe chose to highlight a document which he described as a crib sheet, circulated by TUI to its staff.\nIt told them how to respond to questions from customers about safety in Tunisia in the aftermath of an earlier attack in 2015 on foreign tourists in the capital Tunis in which more than twenty people were killed.\nThey were to tell customers that the overall level of the Foreign Office travel advice had not changed.\nIf asked what is the atmosphere like in beach resorts, the coroner said the TUI crib sheet said the answer was \"It's business as usual, customers continue to enjoy their holidays.\"\n\"It did not mention terrorism or a risk of terrorism.\"\nAlthough the Foreign Office had not advised against people travelling to Tunisia, it had warned on its website of a \"high threat from terrorism, saying \"attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners.\"\nAfter the ruling, 42-year-old Scott Chalkley's family said: \"What is perhaps the saddest is that Scott was taken when he had found true happiness with his partner Sue.\n\"We have been robbed of a future that held promise and laughter of a wonderful man so needlessly and heartlessly snatched from our lives.\"\nThe attack was the deadliest on Britons since the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nSurvivor Allen Pembroke told the BBC how he found people lying in pools of blood among sun loungers close to the water's edge.\nHe gave first aid to British holidaymaker Cheryl Mellor, who was still alive after being shot in the leg and arm, but drifting in and out of consciousness.\nHe said he was alone on the beach for 20 minutes checking on the dead and injured, with no help from anyone else.\n\"I saw no military or medical staff and it's only in recent reports that I found out that the police waited, they fainted, they hid.\n\"That's unforgivable, they need to be accountable for that,\" he said.\nThe Tunisian ambassador to the UK, Nabil Ammar, said his country had been unprepared for such an attack and it was unfair to blame police.\nOur nation is safe - Tunisia ambassador\nSince the attack, he said security in the country and in hotels had improved, and Tunisia should be shown the same solidarity as other countries which had experienced similar attacks.\nFollowing the inquest, Nick Longman, managing director of travel operator TUI, said: \"We have now heard the coroner's findings and his comments regarding the provision of security and visibility of travel advice.\n\"These are complex matters and we have already taken steps to raise awareness of the FCO's Travel Aware campaign.

At home, its political crackdown puts it increasingly at odds with British values.\nShould any of this matter? The UK already has a Chinese company, Huawei, running key parts of its telecommunications network.\nArguably nuclear energy is likewise a business relationship subject to similar national security safeguards.\nBut led by the United States, several other western countries have barred Huawei's involvement in key telecommunications networks on national security grounds.\nAnd no other major developed economy has invited Chinese involvement in a key nuclear energy project.\nTwo years ago the German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked her Australian counterpart what drove his country's policy on China, and he answered \"fear and greed\".\nIn the absence of political change in China, this blunt assessment sums up the calculus for many countries, though the exact proportions of each differ depending on circumstance.\nSome in the British political and security establishment felt that under the previous government's declared \"golden era\" with China, there was not enough fear in London and too much greed.\nOne such was the prime minister's joint chief of staff Nick Timothy.\nIn comments which have received enormous scrutiny since Thursday night's surprise announcement that the Hinkley Point deal would be delayed, Mr Timothy wrote last October on the eve of the Chinese president's state visit to the UK:\n\"Security experts - reportedly inside as well as outside government - are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will\u2026\n\"MI5 believes that 'the intelligence services of\u2026 China\u2026 continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad'.\"\nAccording to the former Business Secretary Vince Cable, the then home secretary did raise national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet.\nSir Vince described Mrs May as \"unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time\".\nInterestingly, Mrs May's less \"gung ho\" attitude on China was already evident in another dimension.\nAs home secretary, she intervened personally when it emerged that the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei had been granted only a 20-day visa to launch his exhibition at London's Royal Academy.\nMs May overturned that decision, ordered a six-month visa and apologised to Mr Ai.\nSo perhaps we will see a more nuanced policy to China under this new government.\nBut this, too, is hard to get right.\nSome in the business and political community will remind Mrs May that her predecessor learned early what it was to feel Beijing's wrath when he ignored Chinese protests and met the Dalai Lama in 2012.\nAs a result, no senior figure in the British government was invited to China for the following 18 months - and when Mr Cameron did finally visit, it was after George Osborne had wrested control of UK-China policy from the more cautious Foreign Office to launch what he called \"the next big step\", a very business-oriented relationship which culminated in President Xi's state visit to the UK last October.\nIt's worth remembering that the Hinkley Point deal was the centrepiece of that visit, the symbol of the \"golden era\" in relations that both governments hoped to launch.\nAnd Beijing has good reason for investing political capital in the nuclear energy relationship.\nChina has more than 30 nuclear power stations at home and nearly as many under construction.\nExporting its nuclear technology is now the priority, and although it has customers like Pakistan in the developing world, the UK's track record and internationally respected safety regime would make it a hugely valuable showcase.\nChina's embassy in London said on Saturday that Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point is a \"win-win\", and UK enthusiasts insists Chinese technology is cheap and safe and that China has too much at stake to want to \"shut down Britain's energy production at will\", as Mr Timothy put it.\nBut if at the end of her review, Mrs May does decide she's unsure about future Chinese intentions and wants to renegotiate, what will happen?\nCould she have Chinese investment for Hinkley Point without any strings attached about a Chinese-designed and built nuclear power station down the line?\nAt this point, we just don't know, but one answer may be no, and if she then walks away, she risks making China angry.\nNow that would cause problems for another stated government goal.\nMrs May is only prime minister because of the Brexit vote, and in a world where the UK stands outside the European Union, it may want to work harder at its economic relationship China.\nLast weekend, Chancellor Philip Hammond was in Beijing and raised the possibility of a free trade agreement.\nIf Chinese pique over a reverse on nuclear energy landed the British government back on what many in Whitehall called China's \"naughty step\", trade negotiations would go into the freezer and howls of protest would follow from those in the business community who were hoping to realise Mr Osborne's \"golden decade\" in economic relations.\nIt's possible that Mrs May won't get to this point in her reassessment, but if she does, she may reflect that if China is minded to exact a price for a change of heart on a business deal, the price for other differences of opinion might become unacceptably high if the same China was in control of a British nuclear power station.\nWhich then brings the prime minister to the question of how other world leaders manage difficulties in their relationship with China.\nSize and strategic dominance puts the United States in a different class, but there's an interesting model closer to home.\nThe German Chancellor Angela Merkel manages to have a close and profitable business relationship with Beijing at the same time as being much more robust in defence of German interests, and much more vocal on other issues like China's territorial assertiveness and its crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech.\nIn Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, Chinese leaders have grown used to British partners who kept most differences behind closed doors, whether on steel dumping, Hong Kong, locking up lawyers or the South China Sea.\nIt would be an ironic twist if one result of the Brexit vote was a reset of UK China policy which put that policy back in line with its more robust EU partners.\nA month ago, Brexit looked like one set of problems for China, mostly focused on economic fears. Now with her Hinkley Point pause, Ms May has delivered a wholly new set of problems.\nBut while Chinese leaders may not like the unpredictable and inconvenient U-turns in policy and style that come with messy democracies, they are increasingly adept at handling them.\nFrom the United States to Sri Lanka and Myanmar, Beijing plays a long and pragmatic game when it comes to new governments.\nSo China liked the Cameron-Osborne team and got used to the chancellor calling the tune on UK-China policy.\nBut with this signal that key decision making has moved from No 11 to No 10 Downing St, Beijing will be working hard to map the players in the May team, and when the prime minister finishes her assessment of the Hinkley Point deal and announces the outcome, you can be sure Beijing will be ready for her.", "summary": "In explaining its shock decision to delay the deal on Hinkley Point, the government said it needed time to consider all components of the deal, but speculation is growing that China questions may be at the heart of the reassessment.", "id": "36935342", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

People would hurry through.\n\"Now, they are taking their time. There are clothes shops, restaurants, bars - It is hard to keep up with the change.\"\nThat change has been driven by housing association Coastal, which since the mid-90s has invested about \u00a330m, half of which was public funding, in buying up the High Street's empty clothes shops, call centres and nightclubs.\nSome have been leased to artists at low rents. An old Iceland supermarket is now the home of the Volcano Theatre, as well as Mr Powell's Elysium Gallery and its 36 studios and library.\nOther High Street buildings have made way for Coastal's Urban Village development, which houses 133 flats, the South Wales Evening Post, independent businesses, Galerie Simpson, and more than 100 of Coastal Housing's Swansea staff.\nSwansea's TechHub has also set up shop there and provides space for 20 digital start-ups, employing up to 300 people.\n\"It was a strategic decision. It was about bringing people back to living in the city,\" Gareth Davies, Coastal's development director, explains.\nRather than just building houses, they wanted to create an \"economic and cultural vibrancy\".\nOne of the most tangible signs of change is the street art.\nIt is all part of the \u00a3400,000 From the Station to the Sea arts project run by Coastal and the Volcano - the front of which is now emblazoned with a large mural of Elizabeth Taylor.\n\"We have a wider interest in making sure that Swansea thrives,\" Mr Davies said.\n\"Clearly we have to be sustainable, but it's about having an eye on the future. Could the High Street look like Shoreditch or Brighton's Sydney Street?\"\nElysium also has studios in the old Barons nightclub, made famous in 1997's cult comedy film Twin Town.\nAbout 100 artists are now working in and around the High Street, making Elysium the biggest provider of artists' studios in Wales.\n\"I don't know how that happened,\" Mr Powell laughs. \"Without Coastal, I don't think it would have happened so quickly. It was always our vision to come back to the High Street.\n\"We are not funded. We pay our own way. And hopefully it will stay like this.\"\nHe said there used to be \"no reason\" for the artists of Swansea to stay and work in the city and believes artists are an important part of how a city should run.\n\"Just like a butcher or a baker, they need somewhere to sell their wares. This wasn't happening here in Swansea. But now that attitude has changed.\"\nWhere artists led the way, private developers are following.\nIcon 21, a \u00a350m, 700-flat student tower on the High Street will be finished by summer 2018 and it is hoped this development will help create a new gateway to the city centre.\nAbout 4,000 student apartments have been approved or are in the pipeline for Swansea; the High Street's Grade II-listed Castle cinema could be turned into flats.\nLast year, a huge \u00a3500m transformation of Swansea city centre was announced, complete with a 3,500-seat arena and \"city beach\" area with bars, restaurants, offices, and five-star hotels.\nBut does this privately-led redevelopment complement the High Street project - or work against it?\n\"Both,\" Mr Powell said. \"People get upset when buildings get knocked down. But it means there is always something new happening. Like the new painting on the Volcano Theatre - it's divided opinion. But we can always paint it over.\n\"Something new will take its place, eventually.\"\nFor some, the High Street is about testing \"new models\" of collaborative regeneration, led by the housing, art and digital sectors who all have a stake in the area.\n\"It's about change happening from the ground up,\" said Carrie Rhys-Davies of From the Station to the Sea.\nAs well as its street art, her project has installed a temporary artwork in the Urban Village and a sound sculpture in one of the High Street's disused alleyways.\nWorking with trader Buon Appetito, it is also reintroducing traditional style awnings.\nArts-led processes like this, Ms Rhys-Davies said, could be a \"brilliant way\" of helping communities realise what changes they want to see.\n\"Regeneration is not always necessarily the best term,\" she added.\nOthers say more mainstream developments will complement what the High Street has to offer.\nRobert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for regeneration, was born on the High Street.\nHe said the revamp of the area gave \"individuality\" to the city, and more footfall from flats meant more customers for artists.\n\"In a city of this size, you normally have around 30 - 40% of the city centre occupied. In Swansea that's just 19%.\n\"What we need is people living and working in the city centre.\"\nYet some have sounded caution about the type of housing being built - and say a truly healthy city centre needs more family accommodation.\nMr Davies agrees more can be done. He said Coastal hoped to focus on the delivery of family accommodation.\n\"Cities have quarters. It's about having everything for everybody.\"\nMeanwhile, the growth of the city continues to attract back those who had left.\nTechHub has capitalised on this. Founder Paul Harwood, a graduate of Newport's University of Wales, said the new space was \"pretty awesome\".\n\"Swansea is probably one of the best places in the world to start a business,\" he enthused.\n\"Low cost is the main factor. We've got great access to talent with the universities, and the community is really friendly.\"\nHe said the arts and technology were \"closely aligned\".\n\"We are often faced with the same challenges - and with very little money.\n\"A good arts sector attracts well-educated people and that is what tech start-ups need to help them grow.\"\nMr Francis-Davies said Swansea University aimed to build on the TechHub's success with city centre digital hubs and the council was working with BT on an ambitious project to develop the fastest broadband in Europe.\n\"We want to make sure that Swansea can compete with the rest of the world,\" he said. \"Swansea grew through invention; the world price of copper was set in the city.\n\"It is time for Swansea to reinvent itself through innovation.\"\nThe change is fragile. Low wages and austerity mean the city will not fulfil its potential overnight.\nYet Mr Powell is cautiously optimistic that \"ugly, lovely\" city recalled by Dylan Thomas is finally blossoming.\n\"The reopening of the Glynn Vivian art gallery has been the icing on the cake.\n\"It's slow. I change my mind from one day to the next. But then if you remember what it was like five years ago, the change is amazing.\n\"That is the key difference really - things are now growing.\"", "summary": "When gallery director Jonathan Powell first started working in Swansea's High Street in 2006 it was \"a bit like Beirut\", he said.", "id": "37776322", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe article is about the regeneration of Swansea, a city in Wales.\nThe article is about the regeneration of Swansea, a city in Wales.

MacDonald was booked and then sent the wrong way as Rooney swept in the spot kick.\nThe home supporters were incensed and further angered when Collum waved away a penalty claim involving Kris Boyd.\nThe Kilmarnock fans had planned a protest against former chairman and current company secretary Michael Johnston in the 18th and 69th minutes - 1869 the year the club was formed.\nSuch is Johnston's lack of popularity that the first disgruntled chants arrived after just six minutes when it became clear the object of their ire was absent.\nDespite all the acrimony, there was a generally vibrant atmosphere among the home ranks but this swiftly changed to gloom as the game went against them.\nConsidine cracked in a smart finish when the ball dropped at his his feet and Taylor was unchallenged at the back post for the Dons' third goal.\nWith Killie in disarray, Rooney scuffed a shot wide with just MacDonald to beat and crashed a shot against the crossbar but he made it third time lucky when Hayes released him and his shot squirmed past the keeper to complete the rout.\nKilmarnock manager Lee Clark: \"What's the point in having a go [about the penalty]? I will only lose a few quid. It was a strange one, that's all I'll say. I've seen the footage back as well. A strange decision to say the least.\n\"First goals are always important. Whether it's changed the game, in the fashion that it ended up, I don't particularly believe so.\n\"Second half we never performed at all. I take full responsibility for that. It's been men against boys in the last two games\n\"It became too easy in the end for Aberdeen. We are very, very disappointed.\"\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"The pitch being a bit narrower, shorter and drier, you have to fight and work hard to get space to operate. Kilmarnock are a very competitive team, they had only lost to Celtic in the past four games, so we knew we had to get on top of them.\n\"Your focus will probably be on some of the movement and brilliant goals, but I thought our tenacity to get after them from the first whistle, play the conditions and get them turned and work hard to get space to get Maddison and McGinn on the ball, overlapping full-backs, Shinnie and McLean up on the game, centre-halves dominating...

His father, a pawnbroker, drove a scooter all his life. In 2009, Mr Kumar, who runs a small automobile spare parts business, bought a Skoda, becoming the first person in his family to own a car.\nWhen Mr Kumar heard from friends that cars damaged in last year's deadly floods in the southern city of Chennai (Madras) were being auctioned, he drove down to the yard.\nThe car enthusiast is looking to pick up the Mercedes he has always dreamt of owning, and never had the money to buy. He has a budget of a million rupees ($14,677; \u00c2\u00a310197).\n\"My wife said if you go the auction, you must return with a Merc. So I am looking for a bargain. If he was alive, my father would have been proud of me,\" says Mr Kumar.\nAll around Mr Kumar and his fellow bidders - a gaggle of used car dealers, buyers and car rental operators - hundreds of cars are parked, end to end. There are hatchbacks, sedans and the much sought after luxury cars like Jaguars, BMWs and Audis.\nMany of the vehicles are still caked in dry mud, and their interiors are mildewed and frayed. Two months ago, a soup of sewage and rainwater filled their insides as Chennai drowned in the worst floods it had witnessed in a century. Many of the vehicles swam aimlessly in the muddy water and died at odd angles; others simply floated and gave up in garages.\nUnder the unforgiving sun in Chennai's non-existent winter, this graveyard of cars is spurring many dreams and aspirations.\nJyotiram Chougle, who owns an automobile repair workshop in the western city of Pune, some 1000km (621 miles) away, is a courier of such dreams.\nWhen three of his customers heard about the auction, they put Mr Chougle on a plane to Chennai. They had read in the papers that a flood-hit 2012 Porsche Cayenne had gone for an eye-popping 500,000 rupees ($7344; \u00c2\u00a35071) in one auction.\n\"I am hunting for luxury cars for my clients - Jaguar, Range Rover, Porsche are their preferred choices,\" he says.\nThere's no Porsche available at the yard this morning, so Mr Chougle takes pictures of a Jaguar and an Audi and sends them to his clients on WhatsApp.\n\"I am a bit confused. I have never been to this city. I have never been to an auction. But I have to get the cars for my clients\"\nBy one estimate, some 40,000 vehicles were damaged by the floods. Around 40% of them are what insurers call total-insurance loss, according to Abhishek Gautam of automobile portal cardekho. It also means, he says, that it is \"too expensive to repair these cars at company-owned workshops\".\nInsurance companies, hit by an avalanche of claims, have towed away the dead cars to resell them through a clutch of firms like Mr Gautam's. Reports say automobile insurance will form the bulk of more than 50,000 claims worth nearly $740m (\u00c2\u00a3480m) arising out of the deluge.\nMr Gautam says his company has received cars on behalf of 18 insurance companies and is looking to sell more than 1,500 flood-damaged vehicles. The firm has already auctioned 700 cars in the past 40 days across three yards they have rented in the city. More than 700 dealers from across India have signed up to bid.\nAt the auctions held by his firm, a 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-class went for as much as 4.4 million rupees, less than half its market price. At the other end, a hatchback went for as low as 20,000 rupees.\n\"It is all about aspiration,\" says Mr Gautam. \"Some buyers here are getting the deals of their lives.\" He loves telling the story of a bleary-eyed construction company manager who arrived at the yard one morning in his pyjamas and and got so excited that he ended up buying an Audi at a third of its market price.\nThe auctioneers insist that water mainly destroys an inundated car's electrical and electronic systems and not much else; the majority of the vehicles don't bear any signs of physical damage.\nThey say spending anything between 70,000 rupees and 200,000 rupees ($1,028-$3,000) will help replace and fix the electronic system and electrical circuitry. The majority of the dead cars, they believe, can be brought back to life in India's thriving cheap car workshops.\nBut automobile expert Hormazd Sorabjee is not very sure.\n\"Water is a car's worst enemy. You have to change a lot of things. Just fixing the electronics and electrical systems may not be enough,\" says Mr Sorabjee, who is the editor of Autocar India magazine.\n\"Water damage can reduce the life of mechanical components of cars, like drive shafts, bearing and suspension components, not to mention the havoc it wreaks on electrical systems.\"\n\"I would say buying a flood-damaged car is a risky gamble\".\nBut tell that to M Prem Kumar, a prolific buyer at the salvage yard, and he smiles.\nArmed with 15 mechanics and 50 electricians, Mr Kumar, 29, is picking up dead cars by the dozen.\nHe makes a living selling cars confiscated from loan defaulters. These days, he's changed gears and is hoping to make a killing by buying dead cars, repairing them and selling them to used car dealers.\nHe has already bought more than 50 flood-damaged cars in the past month, piled them up for repairs in a rented three-acre yard and and claims to have sold 20 of them already.\nMr Kumar shows me the 2015 Jaguar he scooped up at the auction for 1.7 million rupees. A steal, he says, at a sixth of the original price. He's also bought a 2011 Mercedes for 780,000 rupees which, if alive, would sell in the market for 3.8 million rupees. He bought a 2014 Jaguar diesel for 1.5 million rupees.\n\"I have been in this business since I was 16. I know what I am doing,\" he says.\nThe auction is beginning now. There are more than 70 cars up for grabs.\nRising above the din, stock market investor Arun tells me he is looking for a deal to make some money.\n\"The stock market is volatile, and business is dull so I came here to buy a few cars, repair them at the local workshop, sell them and make some money, try out my luck,\" he says. He has already picked up a 2011 Volkswagen Polo for 235,000 rupees, less than half the market price.\nAcross the yard, Naseem, who runs a small rental company, is looking for a bargain basement price for a Toyota SUV to add to his modest fleet at a third of a new car's price.\nAnd what if the car doesn't work after repairs?\n\"Life is a gamble.

That sector, in which Grangemouth has been dominant, was worth \u00a33.7bn last year.\nIf much of that is thrown into reverse, with imports required instead of exports earnings, it will have a significant impact on the cost of sourcing materials from elsewhere, and potentially on the UK's trade figures.\nAmong other big questions that arise: what, if anything, is the government doing about security of refining supply?\nAbout 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors.\nThe dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action.\nThis was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a \"survival plan\", which was rejected by union members.\nWorkers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was \"shocking\".\nOne member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been \"smiling\" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation.\nAnother worker, who did not want to be named, said: \"I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves.\"\nThe worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave.\nHe went on: \"There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas.\"\nIneos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week.\nIneos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well.\nThe refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: \"The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change.\n\"The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split.\n\"Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it.\nBy James CookScotland Correspondent, BBC News\nHundreds of workers at Scotland's largest industrial complex filed in to hear their fate in near silence.\nWhen they emerged after a short meeting on the grounds of the Grangemouth plant some seemed stunned and were reluctant to speak.\nOthers were much more vocal, accusing Ineos of betrayal.\nA few workers in bright orange dirt-stained overalls even seemed close to tears: tough men facing a difficult future, dreading the call to tell their families.\nBut this isn't just a disaster for the workers. According to the Scottish government, the complex as a whole contributes around a billion pounds a year to the economy.\nMinisters in Edinburgh and London are now working furiously to find an alternative future for the petrochemicals plant.\nIf they can't it will be a long hard winter for many workers here in Grangemouth.\n\"The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote.\n\"Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business.\"\nUnite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement \"has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along\".\nHe added: \"Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism.\n\"Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses.\"\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the \"outcome that matches our worst fears\".\nMr Salmond spoke again to management and unions to try and seek further resolution. He also convened an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers to discuss the on-going situation.\nAfterwards he said there was still room for negotiation between both parties, particularly since Unite had put forward fresh proposals to the company.\nMr Salmond said: \"We should give time for the proper consideration of this offer, especially given that we know an agreement between both sides was very close last week, and the prize is a viable future for Grangemouth.\n\"However, given that the current position is the one we always feared possible given the stalemate between the sides, if an agreement between Ineos and Unite is not possible then we will continue to pursue our contingency options of finding a buyer for the site.\"\nMinisters - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision.\nMr Davey said he was \"saddened\" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community.\nHe added: \"Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen.\"\nMr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies.\nHe added: \"I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them.\"\nHowever, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute.\nWorkers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions.\nUnite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts.\nThe company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing \u00a310m a month.\nThe petrochemical plant is said to be losing \u00a350m a year.\nIneos had said it was ready to invest \u00a3300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions.", "summary": "The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced.", "id": "24631342", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe petrochemical plant is said to be losing \u00a350m a year.

In 2017, he has looked unstoppable.\nThere is no question Nadal has rediscovered his mojo on the clay, but opinion is divided over whether he is back to his very best.\nHis new coach believes he's not far away.\n\"I think he's really close to 100%,\" said Moya. \"He's played some matches this year when his level was really good.\n\"It's hard to compare with the old Rafa, but I think if he's not at the same level, he's close to that.\"\nNadal might be the king of clay but his game looks increasingly like hard-court tennis on the red dirt.\nSuccessful in a stunning 76% of points behind second serves, and 69% of first serves, Nadal is then winning 62% of his points in under four shots, as opposed to just 15% in rallies of more than nine strokes.\nAnd it is his most famous shot that once again dominates Roland Garros.\n\"The wheelhouse of the Nadal renaissance has been his forehand,\" says Craig O'Shannessy, strategy expert for Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the ATP World Tour.\n\"He has hit 61 forehand groundstroke winners to the semi-final, with the majority hit straight down the line.\"\nThe image of Nadal might be of long, grinding rallies from deep behind the baseline, but the reality in 2017 is that plan A is stepping in, opening up the court early, running around his backhand and cracking a forehand winner.\nNadal has missed five Grand Slams through injury, and was forced out of last year's French Open with a wrist problem which saw him also miss Wimbledon and curtail his season after the US Open.\nThe punishing nature of his baseline game led many to speculate from the early years that his would be a much shorter career than those of his rivals.\nHowever, rested and rehabilitated, he returned at the start of 2017 to reach his first Grand Slam final since 2014 in Australia, before once again dominating the clay-court season.\n\"I think everybody is a little bit surprised by his performances again, but when he recovers physically 100%, he gets the confidence to fight,\" said former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero.\n\"I think being physically fit is the key to his performances right now.\n\"He had no injuries in the last six months and I think it's very important for him to feel like this.\n\"He's also recovering balls the same as before, impossible points that in the last year maybe we didn't see from him, because he couldn't move as well.\"\nOne of the great coach-athlete relationships in sporting history will end this year when Toni Nadal - 'Uncle Toni' - steps away from life on the tour.\nThe 56-year-old, who made the decision to change a natural right-hander to play left-handed, will return to the family's home of Majorca to concentrate on running his nephew's tennis academy.\nHis departure lends an extra dimension to Nadal's quest for another title at Roland Garros, the place where he and Toni began an extraordinary story 12 years ago.\n\"He always says one of the biggest things for him is to have his family very close,\" said Ferrero.\n\"So to have his uncle as somebody who is there all the time in important moments, bad times, injuries, everything - of course Toni is one of the important people he'll always have in his life.\"\nThe succession plan is well under way, however, with former French Open champion Moya brought on board in December.\n\"It makes me very proud,\" said Moya. \"I know who I am with, how big in the history of this sport he is, so I try to make the most of every day I have with him.\n\"It's been a learning experience for me.\"\nThere were widespread calls for a change in the Nadal team when he went through his prolonged slump, and Ferrero believes Moya's introduction will bring a new dimension to the coaching set-up.\n\"To have someone on the team like Carlos, who knows all the time what is going on in the match because he played on the tour, I think it's very important to have someone who can then go to the locker room and talk about the match,\" added Ferrero.\n\"Rafa can talk with Toni as well but Carlos went through all the matches like he did, so it's something Rafa didn't have before.\"\nYou might think that nine titles and a 77-2 career record would make Nadal stride through the gates of Roland Garros with at least a hint of a swagger.\n\"I won here nine times,\" said the Spaniard, \"and every year that I won I was unbelievably happy, but every year that I came back, I was unbelievably nervous.\"\nIf Nadal carries that feeling with him as a matter of course, the looming prospect of making almost unfathomable tennis history must be an added burden.\nVictory in Sunday's final would make him the first player to win any of the Grand Slam titles 10 times in the open era, and only the second ever after Margaret Court's 11 Australian Open wins.\n\"La Decima? No, no, no,\" said Moya, when asked if it was a subject of discussion in Team Nadal.\n\"You know that it's there but it's coming more from the press and the people and the fans, than from Rafa and his team.\n\"We know it's there but we believe also it can add some extra pressure, so we don't talk about that.\n\"He probably does feel more pressure at this time of year, especially here.\n\"Every year he's coming, he's defending champion most of the time, or if not he knows it's the tournament he has the biggest chances to win, so there's always some extra pressure here.\"\nThere have been plenty of people keen to re-anoint Nadal as the king of clay based on his resurgence this season, but the real tests still lie ahead.\nThe average rank of his opponents so far at Roland Garros has been 39, with Roberto Bautista Agut the highest at 18 in the world.\nNow comes a step up against Thiem, the young Austrian who inflicted Nadal's only clay-court defeat of 2017 with a stunning performance in Rome.\nGet through that, and he faces a final against world number one Andy Murray or former champion Stan Wawrinka.\nSo is a Nadal victory inevitable?\n\"It's difficult to say,\" said seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe.\n\"That's why I wanted to see him and Novak play in the semis - we could see is he really playing better than ever?\n\"Certainly he's intimidating, there's no doubt, and he's the guy to beat.

It found:\nDame Janet Smith report: Key sections\nLiz Dux, a specialist abuse lawyer who represents 168 of Savile's victims, said the report was \"disappointing\", and many victims would feel it was \"nothing more than an expensive whitewash\".\nShe said Dame Janet did not have the power to compel people to give evidence and her clients \"will always be left with that feeling - is everything known about? Do we know the full picture?\".\nMeanwhile, Lord Hall said DJ Tony Blackburn had \"parted company\" with the BBC after failing to fully co-operate with the inquiry.\nMr Blackburn, 73, denies the allegation and says he was cleared of any wrongdoing. In a statement, he accused the BBC of making him a \"scapegoat\" and threatened to sue the corporation.\nAt a news conference to announce the details of the findings into the abuse of Savile and Hall, the director general apologised to their victims and said: \"A serial rapist and a predatory sexual abuser both hid in plain sight at the BBC for decades.\n\"What this terrible episode teaches us is that fame is power, a very strong form of power and like any form of power it must be held to account... and it wasn't.\"\nBBC Trust chairwoman Rona Fairhead said the corporation had \"turned a blind eye, where it should have shone a light\".\nHouse of Commons leader Chris Grayling said it was \"inexplicable\" that BBC staff had missed opportunities to stop the abuse.\nReferring to Savile and Hall, Dame Janet said: \"Both of these men used their fame and positions as BBC celebrities to abuse the vulnerable.\n\"They must be condemned for their monstrous behaviour.\"\nDame Janet's report highlights a number of people who either knew about Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall's abuse, suspected it, or should have known, but failed to take action. In the report, she said:\nTed Beston, Savile's Radio 1 producer, acted as a \"provider\" of young women for Savile at least once, and \"must have realised\" some of the girls were under-age - although he denies this - and should have reported it.\nCanon Colin Semper, who worked with Savile as a producer and on his book God'll Fix It, was praised as \"a completely honest man\"  - and the failure to stop Savile's behaviour had weighed heavily on his mind. However, he \"clearly\" had suspicions about Savile, and should have raised them with his superiors, the report said. He said on Thursday he felt \"utter, utter sadness\" that he had been \"so angled towards the programme\" that he had not seen through Savile.\nDouglas Muggeridge, late controller of Radio 1 and 2 in 1973, launched two investigations into Savile in 1973 but the inquiries were more concerned with \"risk of damage to the BBC's reputation\" than the welfare of the girls who might be involved with Savile.\nRaymond Colley, regional television manager at BBC Manchester from 1970 to 1986, spoke to Stuart Hall about his conduct but failed to check up on the star's behaviour - which could have stopped further abuse. He said he never knew anything about specific incidents, and if he had he would have taken action.\nTom German, late BBC Manchester editor in the 1970s, was \"probably aware\" Hall was having sex on BBC premises and should have shared concerns with Mr Colley, but had not known any underage girls were involved.\nDame Janet Smith report: Key sections\nDame Janet said there had been a \"culture of separation, competition and even hostility between different parts of the BBC, so that concerns arising in one part would not be discussed with others\".\n\"Staff were reluctant to speak out to their managers because they felt it was not their place to do so,\" she said.\nShe said celebrities had been \"treated with kid gloves and were virtually untouchable\".\nSavile exploited his celebrity status to abuse hundreds of adults and children across the country, assaulting or raping them in television dressing rooms, hospitals, schools, children's homes and his caravan.\nThe abuse is thought to have begun in the mid-1940s, when he was in his late teens or early 20s, and lasted until 2009.\nIn his lifetime, millions knew Jimmy Savile as an eccentric TV personality.\nHe was one of Britain's biggest stars, a larger-than-life character who was known for tea time TV favourites such as Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It, as well as stints on BBC Radio 1.\nHe was also, to some, Saint Jimmy, a diligent fundraiser who raised \u00c2\u00a340m for charity.\nBut, a year after his death in 2011, allegations of abuse surfaced.\nIt transpired that he was, in fact, one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators.\nHe had been exploiting his status to prey on hundreds of people - girls and boys, men and women, but mostly vulnerable young females.\nIn 2015, reports on Savile's links with hospitals and children's homes revealed the late DJ abused patients, staff and visitors at institutions over many years.\nProfile: The Jekyll and Hyde TV presenter", "summary": "The BBC missed

A hearty 62% of British consumers say they are likely to be affected by positive online reviews - with negative ones, that soars to 89%.\nOnce upon a time, we kept our stiff upper lips, and we kept online opinions stoically to ourselves.\nThen along popped Amazon and eBay in 1994 and 1995, and with them our habit of scrawling online our joy or chagrin with each latest acquisition.\nWe now measure ourselves and businesses against an economy of likes, follows, and stars.\nOne in sixteen of the people online across the world visited TripAdvisor last July. The website gains 139 reviews each minute.\nTrustpilot's partnership with Google means it provides many of the ratings provided with the search engine's results.\nAnd Yelp's 77 million reviews pulled in 142 million visitors in the first three months of 2015.\nRestaurants which increase their ranking on the platform by one star raise revenue by 5-9%, according to Harvard Business School assistant professor Michael Luca.\nLikes mean lucre.\n\"Negative reviews are the most useful because they continue to challenge our methods, and teach us more about what our customers want,\" says Charlo Carabott, managing director of Mazuma Mobile, a Watford mobile phone recycling company.\nHe says his company engaged with an early spate of negative reviewers, publicly answering their complaints, and now boasts a 9.8 out of 10 TrustScore on Trustpilot, with 100,000 reviews.\nBut for every business like Mr Carabott's, there's another with a more negative reaction. Some will even turn around and sue their critic. Others pen fake reviews, then slate their competition.\nLondon-based Pimlico Plumbers sued Yelp in 2014 for \"defamatory and disgusting\" reviews.\nThey were ultimately taken down as part of a settlement, says Vince Sollitto, Yelp's senior vice president.\nHe says anonymous speech is better protected in America than in England and Wales, where websites can be required to hand over a reviewer's identity under the Defamation Act of 2013.\n\"It never makes sense to sue your customers.\"\nA quarter of companies have taken legal action over online reviews. In nine-tenths of cases where a review is removed, it is because of a threatening legal letter, says Canadian home-improvement ratings site HomeStars.\nA feast for crows if you're a lawyer. HomeStars has introduced a bully warning for businesses that have sent it or reviewers legal letters.\nAnd New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced in September 2013 that 19 companies had agreed to cease posting fake reviews and pay penalties from $2,500 to $100,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,600-\u00c2\u00a364,000, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2,225-88,990 ).\nThe companies ranged from a dentist, a cosmetic surgery, an adult entertainment chain, and the charter-coach giant US Coachways.\n\"It would seem 10-30% of online reviews are fake, based on what I've seen,\" said a veteran of this investigation in the New York Attorney General's office, who did not wish to be named.\nThe typical business leaving fake positive reviews - known as boosting - has either few reviews or a recent crop of negative reviews. Companies also write fake negative reviews - vandalising - attacking the competition.\n\"At the moment, we will have around 3% of the reviews that are flagged, that's either proactively by users or by ourselves,\" says Trustpilot's James Westlake. By context, he adds, the website has one new review every five seconds.\nIndependent businesses are more likely to post fake positive reviews than chains.\n\"The reason is quite simple. When was the last time you checked a review of Burger King or McDonald's? Nobody does that,\" says Dr Georgios Zervas, assistant professor at Boston University, who studies internet markets.\nHe says the number of reviews rejected as suspicious by Yelp, 16%, at present, has increased yearly.\nThere are several telltale signs of fake reviews. They are often shorter, and more extreme, clustered at either end of the scale.\nToo many reviews, or from the same IP address, at the same time is another sign, says Jenny Sussin, an analyst with technology research firm Gartner.\nSo are too many superlatives. And too many adverbs.\nTripAdvisor uses \"approximately 50 filters\", applied by automated systems, says Adam Medros, who heads its product development.\nBorderline cases go to human analysts, of whom there are about 300.\n\"You have interconnectedness of attributes between people, devices, and locations that aren't normal, and they stand out against backdrop of normal behaviour,\" he says.\nFirms suspected of doctoring reviews receive a scarlet letter, a red badge alerting readers that reviews submitted for that business have raised suspicions.\nIt's a cat and mouse game, says Mr Medros, which he confesses he finds geekily intriguing.\n\"There's always going to be an arms race, a little bit, around the tech different people are using, and the ways we use to detect them,\" he says.\n\"They're getting better, we're seeing this in past years,\" says Trustpilot's Mr Westlake.\n\"We identify fraudulent activity and it morphs, like a cold virus.\"\nMany scammers are recent computer science graduates from developing countries such as Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines.\nIn the short term, it is easy for them to fake an IP address, but harder to manage this at scale without tripping alarms.\nWebsites like Yelp have also engaged in more cloak-and-dagger ways to tease out illicit behaviour, posing as scammers, or businesses searching to hire them.\nIf those caught cooperate, it is another source of intelligence into the other side's dark arts.\n\"It turned out we were able to get people to admit they were fake,\" says the specialist from the New York Attorney General's office.\n\"It was a combination of people coming clean, and the occasional email providing enough of a gotcha,\" he says.\nSo why are companies engaging in this behaviour?\nPart of the reason, suggests Yelp's Mr Sollitto, could be local small businesses are the last part of the business world to be brought online.\nMost still spend nearly all their advertising budget in traditional ways, even as studies show consumers searching for and finding them online.\n\"Partly, they get to control the message, the copy, the one-way advertising, even though the reality is that no longer works,\" he says.\nIt will take some time for the small business market to come to accept \"all these old-fashioned methods are worthless\".\n\"What really matters is online, and online you can't control a message.

I want to be one of those icon legends - but seen as an amazing songwriter.\nI'd say you're a more relatable sort of pop star than Beyonce.\nYeah, she's up there. That's why, when I want to be remembered as a legend, I want the songwriting to be first. I want them to say: \"She wrote about things I dealt with. Every age I was in, I related to that.\"\nDo you have a role model for that?\nCarole King. She wrote the same way.\nHow so?\nWhen I write songs, I'll pick a topic but I don't get too specific. I don't say \"he\" or \"she\". I don't say \"you\" or \"me\". I avoid all that stuff so I can relate to everyone.\nSo I have a song, Thank You, that's to my fans. But I make sure that when you hear that, you can also be like, \"I want to say thank you to my parents\". That's a very hard thing for a songwriter to do.\nYou were signed as a writer before you became a performer. Did that feel like an endorsement of your skills?\nI should have taken it like that. But I thought, \"no-one sees me as the face of the song\" and I was kind of sad about that.\nBut now, looking back, I can't believe I was in high school and these people wanted to pay me to write music. That's such an honour.\nHow do you start a song, with the melody or the lyrics?\nMelodies are very easy for me. I can get that done in minutes. But the words, I had to learn how to craft them perfectly, and All About That Bass was the first time I was like, \"every part of this is genius and I love it.\"\nIs it true that the label released the demo of that song?\nYes! There's never been another version. There's no background vocals, no auto-tune. They were like, \"put a stamp on it, it's good to go.\" It's very raw, very real. I think that's why it had its own lane on the radio.\nDid you try to maintain that rawness on the new album?\nWell, at first I started writing doo-wop again. I was like, \"I've got this figured out, let's go!\" and they were like, \"No, Meghan, you're just doing what everyone expects you to do.\"\nSo I thought, what do I miss from the radio? And it was *NSync and Destiny's Child.\nDid you have N*Sync posters in your bedroom?\nI wasn't allowed to have a lot of posters because they kept ruining the paint. But I did have Hilary Duff on my wall. I loved Lizzie McGuire, that show.\nThe video for No is like a classic Britney clip - with a big dance number in a cavernous warehouse. Did you have fun making it?\nYeah! A lot of the treatments had me playing basketball, which didn't make any sense, so I started Googling old videos like [Janet Jackson's] Rhythm Nation and I was like, \"I need something like this.\"\nWas the choreography hard to learn?\nWell, a lot of those dance moves are just me messing around. I'm not a professional dancer but my choreographer Charm [La'Donna] will go, \"can you just freestyle for me?\" And I'm like, \"Oh my God, I hate this.\" And then we turn it into a routine.\nYou had to have surgery on your vocal cords last year. How is your voice now?\nBefore the surgery, you have to sign papers that say, \"if you can't sing again it's not our fault.\" But my voice came back stronger. It's like starting from scratch. You get a clean slate. You get beautiful cords. So I was singing my butt off. I was doing riffs I've never done before. And you can hear from the last album to this one how much my voice improved.\nLet's talk about the rest of the album\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 You've recorded a duet with your mum?\nYeah! I was brushing my teeth one day and I thought I had a million-dollar idea: \"I need a mother's day card song.\" You know, when you open up the card and there's a cute little jingle? I was like, \"Easy! How do I do that?\" And I was brushing my teeth and I wrote the chorus.\nBut we didn't have a bridge and I said, \"Yo, let's call my mom!\"\nSo they put the microphone in front of me and I called her and put her on speaker. And I was like, \"I love you. I miss you so much!\" She instantly knew something was up. She was like, \"Ooooh?! I love you too, honey... Are you ok?\" Totally suspicious.\nBut they turned it into the most beautiful bridge. They made it sound like a movie scene.\nIt sounds like you're a very close family\nThey're really involved in everything I do. We'll even sit down and watch and critique my music videos. Right now, my dad's mad at me because this one ballad's not on the album. I'm like, \"Dad, I have three ballads on the album. I can't just have slow songs.\"\nWhat's the song?\nIt's called Remind Myself and it's a very soulful, beautiful song about remembering everything is good when I'm upset. Which is something I had to learn, because I've always been a worrier.\nI played it for a woman in a hair salon who recently went through breast cancer and had to have a mastectomy, and she was just bawling. She said: \"This is what I needed to hear.\"\nI'd never met her before but this song related to her so personally that it showed me I can affect a lot of people I've never met before.

However, only three of his summer signings have been first team regulars - goalkeeper Joe Lewis, defender Anthony O'Connor and James Maddison, who is due to return to Norwich with his loan spell now over, though McInnes says will be staying until the end of the season.\nHowever, a strong, ball-winning midfielder is likely to be at the top of his shopping list and it would be no surprise if Caley Thistle's Greg Tansey is once again targeted, 12 months on from a failed bid for the Scouser.\nThe Dons could also do with competition for Shay Logan at right-back, with captain Ryan Jack the current deputy for that position. Jack and Niall McGinn are two that McInnes will want to keep beyond this season, though that is far from certain.\nHow do you improve the team that is infinitely better than the rest? Well Brendan Rodgers will use the winter window to prepare for next summer's tilt at Champions League qualifying.\nDespite some promising performances in the competition this season, it was clear that Rodgers will require more quality if they are to take the next step and reach the last 16 or, at least, finish third and drop into the Europa League after Christmas.\nPlayers will surely leave Celtic this month, with the likes of Nadir Ciftci, Kris Commons - on loan at Hibernian - Eoghan O'Connell and Dedryck Boyata barely getting a look in.\nIt is well documented that Dundee's season has been hamstrung by Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings' summer departures and their replacements are yet to make an impression.\nPaul Hartley has been proactive in trying to replace his former star pair but Marcus Haber, Faissal El Bakhtaoui and Rory Loy do not appear to be capable of scoring the 15 to 20 goals that Stewart and Hemmings were.\nHartley has been forced to change the way he wants his team to play. They are now more direct and a target man may be at the forefront of his thoughts this window.\nMartin Canning may be more concerned with the vultures circling New Douglas Park with clubs ready to test their determination to keep midfielder Ali Crawford at Accies.\nLike Dundee, they don't have that player who is going to get into double figures with goals, Alex D'Acol and Rakish Bingham have both been used as the main striker, but Crawford is their top scorer with a lot of his strikes coming from set-plays.\nEamonn Brophy is a talent but isn't yet chipping in with enough goals.\nThese teams are working within a similar budget and are looking for a similar player - one that will score the goals to keep them away from the relegation places - if indeed he is out there.\nThis will be an interesting window at Tynecastle, Ian Cathro's first as manager there.\nThe big question mark would have been over Callum Paterson, who was expected to leave for a seven-figure sum before he was ruled out for up to 10 months with injury.\nThe dip in form since the managerial change will have alarmed many at Tynecastle and they desperately need someone to do the job Adam Rooney does so well for Aberdeen. Conor Sammon and Tony Watt have flopped, to the extent they could both be gone by the end of the month.\nRichie Foran's men have conceded more than anyone else in the division - surprising given the normally reliable Josh Meekings and Gary Warren are at the heart of their defence.\nForan has to look for another defender to give those two some competition though they are surely still two of the best centre-backs in the league.\nWhilst scoring hasn't been their biggest problem this season, another striker who can make the impact Miles Storey made last season when he arrived on loan would be beneficial to a relegation battle. Could they be tempted to ask Aberdeen if Storey is available again given he has started just twice for the Dons? They also need more creativity from the midfield.\nKillie look adequately covered in the forward areas with Kris Boyd and Souleymane Coulibaly supported by Nathan Tyson and Flo Bojaj, albeit Boyd hasn't been at his prolific best this season and Tyson and Bojaj are yet to prove themselves at Rugby Park. Centrally they are also quite strong.\nDefensively, however, they need tighten up if they are to avoid the spectre of relegation and Lee Clark will likely line up a new centre-half having already tried that in the summer with Scott Boyd and Will Boyle brought in. Miles Addison's injury problems haven't helped.\nKillie could also be doing with a creative midfielder behind the strikers in the 'number 10' role. But tightening up his leaky defence is Clark's priority.\nMark McGhee's team is absolutely fine the further up the pitch you go,  they have coped with the loss of Marvin Johnson by using youngsters Chris Cadden and Ross MacLean on the wings recently and clubs like Hearts, Aberdeen or Rangers wouldn't say no to Louis Moult and Scott McDonald.\nIf there is a weakness, it could be the pace - or lack of - in their defence. Steven Hammell and Stephen McManus are terrific players but that side of the Well defence could do with an injection of pace.\nThere can not be a team in the league who has missed more opportunities this season than Partick Thistle, with Ade Azeez the most guilty of all. Kris Doolan is a regular goal-scorer, but they really need to stop being so profligate if they are to avoid the drop.\nThey should have beaten both Rangers and Hearts in recent times and another striker will be considered by Alan Archibald.\nAt the back they look decent and Adam Barton has been a great signing, complimenting Liam Lindsay well at the heart of their defence. However, the knee problem suffered by midfielder Stuart Bannigan has been an issue in central midfield. His return would be like a new a signing.\nIt sounds ridiculous to say that new defenders are required by Mark Warburton given they've only conceded six goals at home and of the 15 they've let in on the road, five of those were scored by a rampant Celtic.\nHowever, the centre-back pairing of Rob Kiernan and Danny Wilson has seldom convinced and the signing of Phillipe Senderos has not worked. Clint Hill has been decent, but is he the long-term answer? No.\nThey could also be doing with an out-and-out winger. Barrie McKay has flirted with good form this season but the rest are either central players or want to be a striker.\nFor the last two or three seasons, the Staggies have used this window to strengthen their squad. This time around it could be quieter, however, as they are picking up good results regularly.\nTwo months ago that may have been a different story, but Jim McIntyre's squad looks strong and in Liam Boyce they have the league's top scorer, so they will hope there are no bids for the Northern Irishman. If anything, a centre midfielder may be on his mind as they are fine in the wide areas.\nIt could be that Roy Macgregor's purse-strings do not require as much loosening this window.\nTommy Wright tends to only sign players who can make an immediate impression on the first team and it could be a quiet window for the Perth club.\nJoe Gormley's lack of impact before quitting the professional game means there is scope for Saints to bring in another forward and a proven goal-scorer is probably the one area they could be doing with sorting out.\nHowever, their squad is almost certainly strong enough to maintain their now regular berth in the Premiership with their settled back four proving, generally, to be stubborn opposition.\nHolding onto star man Danny Swanson will also be key.", "summary": "The January transfer window is now open and several Scottish Premiership sides will be looking to add new faces to their squads over the next month.", "id": "38483287", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"Derek McInnes bolstered his squad in the summer and may be limited in what he can do in this window.

But then so were his beginnings.\nDeep within his 5ft 6in frame the American carries memories of seeing parents take drugs, recollections of scrapping for food, thoughts of foster care, and anguish for the friends lost to Baltimore's gang wars.\nAt 22 he has seen too much darkness. Yet on Saturday he will step out in London's bright lights as a world champion, alongside arguably boxing's most recognisable global face - a man who says Davis is \"like my son\".\nFloyd 'Money' Mayweather has banked on a talent he calls the \"future of boxing\". But can Davis fully cut ties with a brutal past and run towards expectation where once there was hopelessness?\nEnglishman Liam Walsh - one of three professional-boxing brothers from Norfolk - provides IBF super-featherweight title defence number one for Davis at London's Copper Box Arena.\nIt is a long way from Pennsylvania Avenue in west Baltimore, a city where there was almost a murder a day in the year before Davis was born and one where he was left exposed and vulnerable to gang culture.\nMayweather claims Davis and his two brothers lived in a single room as children, sometimes going days without food until authorities stepped in.\n\"I was taken from my mother and father aged four or five\", says Davis - nicknamed 'Tank' because of a perceived large head when he was little.\n\"Seeing my mother and father do drugs... I've been through a lot so there's nothing the next person can do to hurt me.\"\nA dulling of pain and the hunger junior scars had left turned Davis into a formidable, if misguided, fighter. He displayed a vicious anger in school but when an uncle spotted him fighting on the streets, he took him to the gym to focus a destructive nature.\nTrainer Calvin Ford - a man who took up boxing during 10 years in prison after being convicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges - began to channel the attributes worth saving. The character Cutty from acclaimed HBO drama The Wire was based on Ford. He says he and Davis \"saved each other\" and, while life at home saw the fighter move from foster care to a grandmother's house, the gym led him to national titles - and a taste of what could be.\n\"I would definitely be in jail or dead but I stayed in the gym and years later I'm signed to one of the best fighters ever,\" added Davis.\nLife in Baltimore has shaped Davis for 'The Doghouse', the name given to brutal sparring sessions at Mayweather's Las Vegas gym.\nHe signed with Mayweather Promotions in 2015, ushering in a new level of scrutiny as suddenly expectation was on him, rather than simply fuelling a personal battle against the odds.\nAnd the tutoring runs deep. Mayweather sits and studies his protege on the heavy bag, joins him on late-night runs and speaks of a commitment \"to keep him on the right path\".\nBut that goal is complex. Davis' mother is now clean, and training under the reformed Ford in Baltimore offers comfort, so much so he reportedly frustrated Mayweather last year by refusing to move to Las Vegas full-time, insisting he wants to offer people in Baltimore \"hope\".\n\"The first thing, when we signed him, I said 'we have to move your mother',\" added 40-year-old American Mayweather, who won world titles in five weight divisions before retiring unbeaten in 2015.\n\"People kicked in his mother's door when they knew he'd signed for us.\n\"He's like my son. I love him and we've been through a lot in the short period of time we've been together. He's made some decisions I've not been too fond of.\n\"When his career is over I want him to have something. Early on I want him buying real estate and making smart investments. Boxing is short term, if you're a businessman it lasts forever.\n\"Even though he's quiet, he can surround himself with the wrong individuals. He wants to be in the inner city as that's where he comes from but I tell him we have to leave that alone and look to bigger and better things for the future.\"\nBoxing has too many world champions, but of them all only Japan's 21-year-old WBO flyweight king Kosei Tanaka is younger than Davis.\nAs Mayweather tells the media just how good his man is, 'Tank' smiles cheekily, seemingly more than happy to hand the hype job over to a master. The level of praise is striking -  arguably none of the other 30 or so fighters under the Mayweather banner are showered with such projections of greatness.\nThe backing, added to Davis' fan-friendly nature, will tick all the boxes outside of the ring. He has an element of showman about him, though posting videos of himself back-somersaulting from the top rope before landing punches in the gym may not be the safest of ways to attract social media followers.\nHe has admitted to being briefly swayed by the cars and jewellery that come with success, but vowed to go back to basics. They certainly have not softened him. In the ring he is nasty, focused and punishing, traits which will go a long way if he is to avoid becoming one of boxing's many wasted talents.\nA southpaw, Davis' stance makes him tricky and he has been dubbed a 'mini Mike Tyson' by some observers for his stocky, come-forward style. A haul of 16 knockouts from 17 fights also fits the 'Iron Mike' mould.\nIn taking the IBF title last time out he showcased an ability to step up in class, and after some taunting of the champion, inflicted a first career defeat on Puerto Rican Jose Pedraza with a comprehensive knockout.\n\"Dynamite in both hands. Extremely fast. His fight game says he's cocky and arrogant - he doesn't have to say it with his mouth,\" Mayweather told BBC Sport.\n\"When he fought Pedraza I was nervous. It was a big step for him. But he handled it and to do what he did, I thought 'we have a star on our hands here'. This is just the start.\"\nA win over Walsh - unbeaten in 21 fights - would answer more questions and stretch the Davis brand that little bit further.\nBut Davis can expect to meet a stubborn fighter. Walsh is respected in the British fight game for his grit and humility. At 31, he has longed for this chance having suffered injury in a car accident before a postponed meeting with Scotland's Ricky Burns for the WBO lightweight title in 2012.\nThe Cromer-based fighter contrasts all that is Team Mayweather. His gym is devoid of a shower, he speaks of money with no real desire and backs it up by sharing his earnings with his twin Ryan and brother Michael - both featherweights.\nPromoter Frank Warren says his man is \"underestimated\" with a will to \"go to the trenches\" which may break Davis, who he feels has a \"silver spoon in his mouth\".\n\"Floyd is constantly telling him how good he is,\" said Warren. \"In Davis' mind, he is there already. Once that bell goes and the fight starts, he will be looking to the guys in his corner thinking 'you didn't tell me it was going to be like this'.\"\nWarren may well be right. Davis, after all, has never fought professionally outside of the United States. But surely, after all he has seen and come through, fighting on foreign soil hardly seems a road block?\nWalsh would be foolish to think hostility will tame this product of Baltimore's streets. Davis has walked a path of much resistance to reach spectacular heights.", "summary": "\"I would definitely be in jail or dead.\"", "id": "39965423", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"He has an element of showman about him, though posting videos of himself back-somersaulting from the top rope before landing punches in the gym may not be the safest of ways to attract social media followers.\"\n\"He has an element of showman about him, though posting videos of himself back-somersaulting from the top rope before landing punches in the gym may not be the safest of ways to attract social media", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nDavis' father, a former boxer, was shot dead in 2007.

He later made it 3-0 with a well-placed header to cap a memorable night.\nAfter the final whistle, the supporters known as the Green and White Army refused to leave the ground, singing in celebration as the realisation that so many years of hurt were over, began to sink in.\nThey were rewarded with an encore as their players came back out for a lap of honour.\nPredictably, manager O'Neill got a special ovation as he was joined on the pitch by his two daughters and also lifted up by this players.\nFew would have given Northern Ireland much hope of reaching the expanded Euro finals, coming after a dismal qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup in which O'Neill's men lost to Luxembourg and could not beat Azerbaijan.\nEven going into Thursday's match, there were doubts as Northern Ireland were without four key players in suspended Lafferty, Chris Baird and Conor McLaughlin and injured Jonny Evans.\nBut it all went right on the night at the partly-rebuilt Windsor Park, and O'Neill's men are top on 20 points and have scored most goals in the group.\nNow 12 December has been put in the diary as that is when the draw for next year's finals takes place in Paris.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNorthern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill: \"Tonight we were without four of our top players and yet we can come and win the game and win the game so well in such a tense occasion.\n\"We look forward to the draw now, it gives everyone something to look forward to.

With the loss of six seats, they will be forming a minority administration, having enjoyed a majority for the last five years.\nThis note of disgruntlement comes down to two factors....\nSince the 2014 independence referendum the SNP has been an absolute juggernaut. Its membership has swelled to more than 116,000, the party's conferences and even manifesto launches are more like rock concerts than sober discussions of public policy.\nIt smashed its rivals in the 2015 general election, coming near to sweeping the entire country, and every poll predicted a second outright majority at Holyrood on Thursday. As we now know, this was not to be.\nIn truth, the position the SNP occupied prior to polls opening was already unprecedented. Holyrood isn't meant to have a single party commanding an outright majority - the way the electoral system is set up works very effectively against this.\nSo if the 2016 results might seem like a relative disappointment for the SNP, it is because whether by force or fluke, they broke the system in 2011.\nHolyrood's Additional Member System strives for a model of proportional representation. While the Westminster model of first past the post is geared towards strong governments toting stonking majorities, Holyrood's system seeks balance and fairness between parties.\nAnd in this regard, it appears to have worked to perfection; on Thursday, the SNP won just under half of the votes cast, and will head back to Holyrood with just under half of the MSPs.\nThere's an obvious contrast with the 2015 general election; there, the SNP won 50% of the vote in Scotland, and were rewarded with 95% of the seats on offer. Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems netted a solitary MP each, despite their wildly differing performances on the night of 24%, 15% and 7.5% respectively.\nThese are the kind of quirks the complex calculation at the heart of Holyrood's system - the D'Hondt method, named for the Belgian mathematician who created it - is designed to iron out.\nIn simple terms (avoiding entirely any talk of \"quant = V / s+1\"), the more seats a party wins in the 'first past the post' constituency races, the less they are likely to collect some in the regional list.\nAn example is Glasgow - the SNP swept all eight constituency seats, thumping Labour in what was once their back yard. This meant they were already handsomely represented in the area, leaving Labour, the Tories and the Greens to share out the list seats according to their share of that vote.\nIt would have been almost impossible for the SNP to add to their tally in Glasgow - hence some supporters of other pro-independence parties, such as Rise, Solidarity, and the Greens, campaigning hard for list-vote support from SNP constituency-voters.\nHowever, the SNP didn't want to run any risks with their campaign. Because if somehow Labour had held one or two of the Glasgow constituencies, they would want to have a strong chance at picking those seats up again on the list. Hence \"both votes SNP\" came to be plastered across every bit of their campaign material.\nNow, in the Holyrood election just past, it was widely expected that the SNP would win enough seats from the 73 constituencies up for grabs to form a majority outright, without having to rely on the allocation of MSPs from the regional lists.\nThey did not. And when it came down to it, even with a strong showing in the list vote, it simply wasn't possible for the formula to spit out enough Nationalist MSPs for a majority.\nIn 2011, the stars aligned in just the right way for the SNP. They were able to bring home 16 list MSPs on top of the 53 they won from constituencies.\nViktor D'Hondt himself may have struggled to explain it, but in basic terms the placing of their constituency wins balanced out perfectly with enormous support on the lists to return relatively large numbers from both ballots.\nThat election \"broke\" the system; the SNP made off with a majority of seats (53.49% to be precise) despite only winning 45.39% of constituency votes and 44% of the regional list ones.\nThis time round, a slightly reduced 41.7% of the vote only translated into four list MSPs - although (and indeed because) the 59 constituency seats won with 46.5% of the vote is itself a Holyrood record.\nThe list system will take some flak from the \"both votes SNP\" crowd, but at the end of the day the party's failure to sew up the constituency vote proved equally decisive.\nThe SNP took a good number of seats, annihilating Labour in Glasgow in particular. But they also lost some - and in key areas.\nWillie Rennie and his Lib Dems frustrated them, swatting away challengers in Orkney and Shetland with ease despite the controversy of the Alistair Carmichael affair, before actually seizing SNP seats in North East Fife and Edinburgh Western.\nThe Tories too mounted successful raids, with Ruth Davidson pinching Edinburgh Central and Alexander Burnett toppling Dennis Robertson in Aberdeenshire West - both surprising results.\nMs Davidson's party also took seats from Labour which the SNP considered themselves strongly in the hunt for, in Dumfriesshire and Eastwood.\nThe placing of these seats, nestled among great blocs painted SNP yellow, meant the nationalists had relatively little hope of gaining them back on the list vote.\nThe only region of the country where the SNP didn't win the majority of constituency seats was South Scotland - and there they picked up three list seats. This swung the equation against them when it came to dishing out list MSPs.\nLooking at exactly where the six SNP seats from 2011 were lost, Lothian was the key area.\nHere, the SNP lost constituency seats to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems, but were unable to win any of them back on the list.\nThe fact the party won five of the eight constituency seats meant they faced little hope of gaining any of the three lost back through the list, and this was extinguished by an 11.3% surge in the Tory vote and a 3% jump in the Green one, with both of those parties gaining.\nIn Highlands and Islands, no constituency seats changed hands, with the Lib Dems holding two and the SNP six, But the SNP's support on the regional list fell by 7.8%, while the Tory and Green votes again jumped, meaning each of those parties picked off an SNP list seat.\nIn Mid Scotland and Fife, the SNP lost North East Fife to the Lib Dems but gained Cowdenbeath from Labour. But on the list their vote dropped by 3.9%, while the Tories gained by 11% and the Greens by 1.9%, meaning the single SNP list MSP was lost.\nThe same pattern was repeated in North East Scotland, where the SNP lost a single constituency seat to the Tories and another on the list, thanks to a 13.9% jump in the Tory list vote.\nSo the double-digit increase in the Tory list vote, partnered with a gentle decline in the SNP's support and a small uptick in backing for the Greens, meant the list vote could not make up for the losses of constituency seats in these key areas.", "summary":

Marcus Rashford and Danny Welbeck were reduced to cameo appearances. Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge were unused substitutes. And wildcard possibilities like Andy Carroll or Jermain Defoe were injured and off-form respectively.\nNot even the likes of Dele Alli, Adam Lallana or Theo Walcott got on the scoresheet, meaning no English player had scored this weekend before Sunday's late game between Swansea and Leicester.\nBut it wasn't Foxes striker Jamie Vardy who finally broke the duck, as Swans centre-back Alfie Mawson produced a stunning volley to become the only English goalscorer in all nine of this weekend's fixtures.\nThough perhaps Mawson, 23, should not be considered an unlikely scorer, having struck three times in his past six Premier League games, of which Swansea have won four.\nIndeed, no defender has scored more Premier League goals in 2017 than Mawson, with Chelsea' Marcos Alonso also scoring three times.\nMawson is not the only symbol of Swansea's improvement under boss Paul Clement, as they possess - by one measure - the best midfielder in the Premier League this season.\nAfter his pass set up Martin Olsson for Swansea's second against Leicester, Gylfi Sigurdsson has now been directly involved in 16 goals this season, more than any other midfielder, in an even split of eight goals and eight assists.\nThe Iceland international has scored three goals and assisted three others in Swansea's six games since Clement's appointment on 2 January, putting him ahead of perhaps more lauded names on the list.\nLiverpool duo Sadio Mane and Lallana are close behind with 15 and 14 respectively, while the talents of Spurs pair Alli and Christian Eriksen, Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne are all tied on 13.\nIn victory over Watford at Old Trafford on Saturday, Manchester United became the first team to win 2,000 points in the Premier League.\nIt's no surprise the Red Devils got there first, given they have won 13 out of the 24 total Premier League titles to date but here is how they did it...\nIt is no shock either that the top six are the only six clubs to have played in ever Premier League season so far but Arsenal, in second for many years, may want to be wary of Chelsea bearing down on them before long.\nManchester United have a fairly lengthy wait until they try for win 600, with Jose Mourinho's side not back in Premier League action until 4 March against Bournemouth.\nMost sides tend to prefer their home comforts - a vocal crowd, a familiar pitch, that ideal spot in the dressing room - but Burnley are taking that preference to remarkable levels at Turf Moor this season.\nA battling draw with runaway leaders Chelsea on Sunday is the 29th point Sean Dyche's side have claimed at home this campaign, as many as Arsenal have taken at the Emirates, and putting them fourth in the Premier League home table.\nTheir home form has seen 12th-placed Burnley punch above their weight and all but secure their Premier League status, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.\nEvery yin must have its yang though and Burnley's away record is in startling contrast to their home form, having taken only one point in 11 games so far before a run of four consecutive matches on the road.\nTravel sickness is a large factor in Leicester's alarming decline too - Sunday's defeat to Swansea meaning they are still yet to win away this season, with only three draws in 13 away games.\nIndeed, at the moment the Foxes do not look like picking up another point anywhere in 2017 as they are now the first reigning top-flight champions to fail to score in six consecutive league matches, having gone over 10 hours without a goal.\nNo side in the top four tiers has won fewer points than Claudio Ranieri's side this calendar year - a draw against Middlesbrough in January giving the Foxes a solitary point, level with Aston Villa, Coventry City and Leyton Orient.\nYet if there is to be solace for Leicester it is probable that, like Burnley, it will come at home.\nBoth Leicester and Burnley are currently two of only six sides in Premier League history to have won more than 80% of their total points at home in a single season.\nOn current trend, with a remarkable 96.7% of points (29 out of 30) at Turf Moor this season, Burnley could be set to smash their 2009-10 record of 86.7% (26 out of 30). Fortunately for Dyche, his team have already equalled that 2009-10 side's final tally of 30 points.\nDespite arriving at the Riverside with a free-scoring Romelu Lukaku and on a fine run, Everton's match with Middlesbrough was perhaps destined to end in a goalless draw.\nBoro have easily the meanest defence of the current bottom six, having conceded only 27 goals in 25 games - the same amount as seventh-placed Everton - despite being only two points above the relegation zone.\nIf Aitor Karanka's side keep conceding at the rate of 1.08 goals per game, they will end the season with 41 goals against their name - and should they fail to beat the drop that would be comfortably the fewest number of goals conceded by a relegated Premier League side.\nThat is of course only half the story with Middlesbrough, as they are also the most miserly team in attack this season, with only 19 goals.\nAt a rate of 0.76 goals per game, they are on course to finish the campaign with just 29 goals - but there is precedent for staying up with such a sterile strike force.\nIn the 1996-97 season, Leeds United finished 11th, six points clear of relegation, despite scoring 28 goals in 38 games.\nAn ageing Ian Rush failed to fire after signing from Liverpool, while Brian Deane and Lee Sharpe were top scorers with just five strikes.\nYet manager George Graham's defensive nous saw them cough up just 38 goals (six fewer than champions Manchester United) as they eased to safety. Can Karanka do the same?\nIn finance, the 'dead cat bounce' is a small, short-lived recovery as the price of a stock declines.\nFootball has its own theory - the new manager bounce, where a team's form improves after hiring a new boss and Sam Allardyce was once one of its finest proponents.\nThough just as the dead cat bounce gives way to further decline, perhaps we've seen the peak of Big Sam's survival skills.\nDefeat to Stoke on Saturday means Allardyce's side have taken just four points from eight Premier League games since he replaced the sacked Alan Pardew.\nAllardyce has previously always won more than a point per game in his first eight in charge when taking over a Premier League side mid-season, in spells with Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and Sunderland.\nWhether or not his typical dead cat bounce is simply delayed, 19th-placed Palace find themselves in a relegation dogfight.", "summary": "An unlikely sole English goalscorer, Burnley find home comforts again and is this the end of the Big Sam bounce?", "id": "38951101", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Premier League's top scorer is not a striker, but a midfielder.\nThe Premier League's top scorer is not a striker, but a midfielder.

Released on Friday, Walls has gained the band their best reviews since 2008's Only By The Night, which included the global hits Sex On Fire and Use Somebody.\n\"They sound more focused and alive than they have for a while,\" wrote the NME, while Entertainment Weekly called the album \"their richest, most textured effort yet\".\n\"Everyone seems to be liking it, so we're excited to get the train rolling and get to touring this bad boy,\" says drummer Nathan Followill, speaking to the BBC from the band's base in Nashville.\nHello, Nathan. It's early morning over in Nashville. What have you been up to at this time?\nI just dropped my baby girl off at school, then I'm gonna hit the gym and go to rehearsal.\nDoes your daughter still cling on to you at the school gates?\nNah, she's good. She didn't even look back at me when I was saying, \"Have a good day today\". I was a little depressed on the ride home, I'm not going to lie.\nFive years ago, it looked like Kings of Leon were over. Caleb walked out of a gig, a tour was cancelled and you went on hiatus, then your comeback album stalled. Do you feel you've regained your underdog status?\nDefinitely. We were the underdogs right out of the gate. Our whole career, we were that guys that watched the bands we'd played with blow up. And we were all sitting back thinking, \"We're playing 200 shows a year, we're putting in the work, but we're not reaping the benefits\".\nAfter the hiatus, there was an urgency to get another record out there and I think we went a little too quick. But that's the nature of the beast. You know, the labels want records and as a band you want records.\nWe had kind of settled into a comfort zone. We could have kept making records the same way, and I'm sure our diehard fans would have continued to buy them - but this record, we just wanted to throw everything out the window.\nYou've said Markus Dravs really shook things up in the studio. Were you nervous about working with him?\nThe first day of a record, you're always nervous and excited - but with a new producer, especially. So we were a little timid.\nAnd in his defence, walking in with just a regular band can be intimidating, but when everyone in the band is related and has an opinion, I think that can be even scarier.\nAnd was he really that bad?\nI think there was a time early on where we realised it was going to be a lot of hard work - but once we all got on the same page, it was pretty much instant magic.\nSo what was his approach?\nIt could be something as simple as taking a song we were playing slow, and saying \"OK, now how would the Sex Pistols play it?\"\nWe were like, \"You're out of your mind. We've been playing this slow for six months\", and he said, \"Just humour me\". So we'd play it his way and listen back and go, \"Damn, he's right. Again\".\nBut, man, we hardly got to listen back to the music during the recording. He did not let us listen to it at all. He was like, \"Just trust me, I've got the record in my head' and we were like, \"Hopefully we'll get to hear it one day!\"\nStill friends?\nI talk to Markus every week. Listen, we put the guy in hospital. He got pneumonia the first week, and was in hospital for a couple of days. So the fact that he rode it out and stuck with us, that meant a lot.\nThe single, Around The World, is such an obvious radio hit. Do you deliberately seek out songs like that?\nWe definitely knew that had the potential to be a fun song for festivals. We play so many festivals that, when we make records, we kind of have that in the back of our minds.\nObviously, we were all smiling very big the day we recorded that one.  All kinds of crazy things happened to get the sounds that are on that song. Some of the percussion is someone hitting a beer bottle with their wedding band.\nNow, you say beer - but I read an interview with Caleb where he said it was a Perrier bottle. Who's telling the truth here?\nOh well, one man's Perrier is another man's beer!\nTalking of percussion, the drums on Over are very intricate...\nIt's one of the hardest songs I've had ever to play!  Most of those parts are just me goofing off, and then I'm like, \"Oh crap, I'm going to have to play this every night for the next God knows how long\".\nDo you play to a click track [metronome] on stage?\nNo, never. I find that click tracks restrain me more than anything else. As long as you're speeding up together and slowing down together, nobody really notices.\nThere's a danger you'll sap the performance of energy...\nI think it takes the emotion out of the song. We are all self-taught, so it's better for us to flow together. I've got buddies that play to a click every night and they're phenomenal, but it always seems to be missing that live magic, where anything can happen.\nBut I will say that we recorded one song on the album straight through, with no click track, and it came in at three minutes and 19 seconds. We played it one more time and it was identical: Three minutes and 19 seconds. Identical. So we're pretty good at locking it in.\nThat's in the studio. Live, with 100,000 people screaming, it's kind of impossible not to get the blood going, and you tend to speed everything up. It's a good problem to have.\nIt's been eight years since you headlined Glastonbury. Would you do it again?\nMost definitely. We love Glastonbury. I think that was the first festival we ever played in Europe. Do they still do it where it's on one year, off one year to let the grass grow?\nThere's a break every couple of years. So it's on next year, but off in 2018.\nOK, then we'll have to get on it in 2017. I'll have to text Mr Eavis.\nNow that you're back as a band, have you taken steps to prevent a fall-out happening again?\nOh yeah. Anyone who has a brother - or a sister for that matter - you're going to have times where you argue and fight. But we're older now, we're more mature and we have families who rely on us. That's a good motivating factor.\nI think that the Dallas gig was something that was probably going to happen. I would have preferred for it to happen behind closed doors and not in the middle of a show - but it had to happen for us to continue on. It was never as bad as it was put out there in the press. There was never any talk of us breaking up. Within a few weeks, we had already talked about getting together and jamming.\nI'm glad it happened because it enabled us to take a step back and look at what was important to us musically, and what we want our legacy to be. I think this record is our redemption record.

The worry is the lack of form from Christian Eriksen, who hasn't scored in the league since October. They are over-reliant on Harry Kane. If he gets injured they'll be in trouble.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri told BBC Match of the Day: \"We wanted to win but we knew it was a difficult match. Tottenham started very well and put us under pressure but we didn't lose our confidence or shape and it was difficult for them.\n\"In the second half it was an open match.

But if you want to call me a bitch, that's not accurate. Because it's just not in my nature.\"\nAside from politics, the 23-year-old has a deep connection with her audience, exchanging long, heartfelt messages to counsel fans through hard times; and sending cookies and cocoa to teenagers who queued to see her in the depths of winter.\nThe intensity of that bond was evident in her response to the terrorist attack at her concert on Monday, which claimed the lives of 22 fans.\nWriting on Twitter, she simply said she was \"broken\".\nAriana Grande-Butera was born in Boca Raton, Florida on June 26, 1993.\nThe singer is of Italian descent and her name is believed to have been inspired by Princess Oriana from the cartoon series Felix the Cat.\nBlessed with a four-octave vocal range, she took her first steps on stage at the age of eight; starring in local theatre productions of Annie and The Wizard of Oz, while studying the French horn and writing songs inspired by DIY indie artist Imogen Heap.\nSpeaking to Billboard magazine in 2014, Grande called herself a \"very weird little girl\" who didn't always fit in with her peers.\n\"Dark and deranged. I always wanted to have skeleton face paint on or be wearing a Freddy Krueger mask, and I would carry a hockey stick around. I was like a mini-Helena Bonham Carter,\" she said.\nIn 2008, when she was 15 years old, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13: The Musical and that led to a role as the adorably dimwitted Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon sitcom Victorious and its spin-off, Sam & Cat.\nThe latter only lasted one season, with rumours of bad blood between Grande and her co-star Jennette McCurdy. But by the time it finished, she was already on her way to becoming an international pop star under the guidance of Justin Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun.\nHer debut single, Put Your Hearts Up, was released in 2011. A fairly nondescript teen pop record, it failed to chart and Grande subsequently disowned it.\n\"It was geared toward kids and felt so inauthentic and fake,\" she told Rolling Stone.\n\"That was the worst moment of my life. For the video, they gave me a bad spray tan and put me in a princess dress and had me frolic around the street. The whole thing was straight out of hell. I still have nightmares about it, and I made them hide it on my [YouTube] page.\"\nHer debut album was better, especially the breathy, flirtatious single The Way; but Grande's career didn't really take off until she released Problem in 2014.\nThat single flipped pop wisdom on its head, with the singer belting out the verses in full-force diva mode before whispering the chorus - \"I got one less problem without you\" - over a skittish saxophone riff.\nIt caught fire instantly, rocketing to the top of the iTunes chart in 37 minutes, before the song had even been played on radio.\nGrande followed it with a series of high-profile collaborations, with Zedd (Break Free), Jessie J and Nicki Minaj (Bang Bang) and The Weeknd (Love Me Harder), cementing her position as the breakthrough artist of 2014.\nThe singer stood out not just for her vocal chops, but her image. While Miley Cyrus was swinging around on her wrecking ball, Grande dressed like a 50s teen idol, her hair scraped back into a pony tail, and topped with a pair of cat ears.\n\"I don't feel confident in my sexuality or in my fashion,\" she told the New York Daily News. \"I think of music first. I want people to listen instead of look and judge.\"\nBut look and judge they did; and Grande bristled when the media trained a spotlight on her relationships. Beneath those cat's ears, it turned out, were the claws to match.\n\"I'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy,\" she told The Sun in 2015. \"I'm not Big Sean's ex, I'm not Niall [Horan]'s new possible girl. I'm Ariana Grande.\"\nShe followed that up with a longer essay on feminism, in which she said: \"I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to / having sex with (or not) ... but by their value as an individual\".\nThen, when two hapless radio hosts asked her to choose between her make-up and her phone, she replied: \"Is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between? Is this men assuming that's what girls would have to choose between?  You need a little brushing up on equality.\"\nBut her public image took a knock when, two years ago, she was caught on surveillance tape with her boyfriend in a California doughnut shop, where the size of the produce led her to proclaim, \"I hate America\" before, bizarrely, licking a doughnut that remained on sale after she left the shop.\nGrande quickly took to social media to apologise, explaining that the target of her comments was America's lackadaisical attitude towards childhood obesity - but it was a public relations disaster, portraying her as a selfish, entitled diva.\nThe star turned the tables, though, when she hosted Saturday Night Live in 2016, putting her transgression in harsh perspective.\n\"It can be tough growing up in showbusiness, you know?\" she said in her monologue. \"A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught looking at a doughnut they didn't pay for.\"\n\"Which, yes, was childish and stupid... [but] I think I'm in a place where I'm ready to be caught in a real adult scandal,\" she continued, before launching into a jazzy showtune called \"What will my scandal be?\"\nHer stint on the show was a very public rehabilitation, and one which made a virtue of her talent for impersonating other musicians (Celine Dion said she \"peed herself\" watching Grande mimic her on television).\nIt also helped launch the star's third album, Dangerous Woman - a mature, confident record which the singer's confidence grow to match her vocals, particularly on the dusky, slow-burning title track.\nLyrically, she addressed her transgressions, not only apologising for, but owning her mistakes.\n\"I've been doing stupid things, wilder than I've ever been,\" she sang on Bad Decisions, before adding the caveat: \"Ain't you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch?\"\nDangerous Woman went platinum in the US and gold in the UK, assisted by a trio of top 10 hits and a Grammy nomination for best pop album.\nIt also spawned her biggest tour to date - one which looks likely to be suspended after the tragic events of Monday night.\nWriting on Twitter in the aftermath of the explosion, Grande said: \"From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry.\"\n\"I don't have words.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

His father was a Greek Cypriot restaurateur who had come to the UK in the 1950s, while his mother was an English dancer.\nIt was not altogether a happy childhood. Michael later recalled that his parents worked constantly to improve their financial status leaving little room for affectionate moments. \"I was never praised, never held. So it wasn't exactly the Little House on the Prairie.\"\nHe moved with his family to Hertfordshire while in his teens and met Andrew Ridgeley, a fellow pupil at a local school. The two discovered they had a shared interest in music and, together with a group of friends, formed a ska band which had a short lived existence.\nIn 1981 Michael and Ridgeley formed Wham! Their first release, Wham Rap! failed to trouble the charts but the follow up, Young Guns (Go For It) established the group after they were asked at the last minute, to perform it on Top of the Pops complete with dancers. The record quickly rose to No 3 in the UK charts.\nGeorge Michael: A life in pictures\nHow the world reacted\nThe duo initially adopted a leather-clad rebellious image with songs such as Bad Boys, but moved to a more pop-oriented approach with the world-wide hit, Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, while the band members swapped their leathers for more fashionable attire.\nWith Michael very much the front man, it was almost inevitable that he would eventually strike out on his own. The 1984 single, Careless Whisper, while co-written by Ridgeley, was to all intents and purposes a George Michael solo effort. Indeed it was credited to Wham! featuring George Michael in the US.\nWham! finally split up in 1986 and in the spring of the following year Michael released I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me) a duet with one of his musical icons, Aretha Franklin.\nHe was also beginning to experience doubts about his sexuality. In an interview with The Independent he blamed his depression after the Wham! breakup on the dawning realisation that he was not bisexual but gay.\nMichael spent most of 1987 writing and recording his first solo album, Faith, which was released in the autumn of that year. It went to the top of both the UK and US charts going on to sell more than 25 million copies and winning a Grammy in 1989.\nThe first single from the album, I Want Your Sex, caused some controversy, particularly on US radio stations. Many refused to play it at all while others played a version substituting the word love for sex. In any event the single reached the top three on both sides of the Atlantic.\nA 1988 world tour cemented Michael's status as a pop superstar although the constant touring and the adulation of thousands of screaming teenage girls left him feeling exhausted and only exacerbated the periods of depression that he was now beginning to experience on a regular basis.\nIndeed he refused to promote his second album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 and no videos were made to back up the single releases. A much more introspective work than Faith, the album was aimed at a more adult audience.\nWhen China woke up to Wham!\nHave more famous people died in 2016?\nIt failed to achieve the success of his previous work in the US although there were contrasting fortunes in the UK where it actually outsold Faith.\nWhile playing a concert in Rio on his Cover to Cover tour in 1991 he met Anselmo Feleppa, the man who would become his partner, although Michael still did not publicly state that he was gay. Their relationship was to be short-lived as Feleppa died of a brain haemorrhage in 1993.\nPlans for Listen Without Prejudice Vol 2 were scrapped amidst a legal dispute with his record company, Sony. In what proved to be  a long and costly battle Michael finally severed his relationship with Sony.\nIn 1996, Michael released the single, Jesus to a Child, a tribute to his dead lover, Feleppa. It went straight to No 1 in the UK. The single featured on the Older album, which had been three years in the making when it was released in 1996.\nA dark and sometimes melancholy work, Older contained a number of references to his sexuality and his change of image saw the long hair and beard replaced by a cropped haircut and leather clothes.\nThe album was a big success in the UK and Europe but achieved disappointing sales in the US, where audiences still seemed to hanker after Michael the pop superstar rather than the more serious artist that he had aspired to become.\nHe was voted Best British Male at the Brit Awards and won the title Songwriter of the Year for the third time at the Ivor Novello awards.\nThe death of his mother from cancer saw him spiral into another round of depression. He told GQ magazine that he had contemplated suicide and had only been dissuaded by the support of his new partner, Kenny Goss.\nIn April 1998 he was arrested in a Beverley Hills public toilet by an undercover police officer and charged with engaging in a lewd act. He was fined and sentenced to 80 hours of community service.\nThe incident finally persuaded him to go public about his sexuality and his relationship with Kenny Goss, a Dallas based businessman.\nHe continued to record, releasing an album of cover tracks in 1999 entitled Songs from the Last Century, before spending two years writing and recording the album, Patience, which was released in 2004.\nIt was seen as something of a comeback, achieving instant success in the UK and even reaching No. 12 in the US, a market that seemed to have rejected him.\nFollowing the release of Patience, he told the BBC that he would no longer make albums for sale to the public, preferring to produce free downloads of his music and ask fans to contribute money to charity.\nIn 2006 he set off on his first live tour for 15 years and became the first artist to perform at the newly reopened Wembley Stadium.\nHis private life continued to dominate the headlines. In February 2006 he was arrested and charged with possession of class C drugs and in July of that year the News of the World printed allegations that he had been engaging in sexual activity on London's Hampstead Heath.\nMichael threatened to sue photographers for harassment but admitted that he often went out at night seeking what he called \"anonymous and no-strings sex.\"\nIn August 2010 he was sentenced to eight weeks' imprisonment after pleading guilty to driving while under the influence of drugs. He was released after serving half his sentence.\nJust before the start of a concert in Prague in 2011 he announced that he had split from his partner Kenny Goss two years previously, blaming Goss's addiction to alcohol and his own battles with drugs.\nGeorge Michael was a man whose talent made him a global star but he was never comfortable in that role. He once admitted that, in his younger days,  the figure adored by thousands of screaming fans was just a kind of alter-ego he sent out on stage to do a job.\nHe fought hard to be accepted as a serious singer-songwriter and record producer, and successfully adapted his style to suit a more mature audience, all while struggling with depression and doubts over his sexuality.\nHe will be remembered as one of the more enduring musicians of the 80s generation.", "summary": "His talents as a singer, songwriter and music producer made George Michael one of the world's biggest-selling artists.", "id": "15925376", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nGeorge Michael was a man whose talent made him a global star but he was never comfortable in that role.

For instance, on asylum, the UK has international obligations to provide refuge to people who have fled persecution. The most complicated part of the system is the broad criteria around economic migration.\nHow are economic migrants dealt with?\nThe rules for economic migration, which includes students, broadly divide migrants into two groups.\nIf a migrant is a citizen from one of the European Union's member states (or one of the other counties in the European Economic Area - EEA), then they are free to compete for jobs in the UK. They are not subject to immigration controls.\nThis is because the UK is part of the European free market under which goods, services and labour can freely move across borders. The rules mean that British workers can equally seek work and settle across the rest of the EU.\nAnd what about if you come from elsewhere?\nIf you come from anywhere else, including Commonwealth nations, a migrant has to apply under one of the \"tiers\" that make up the Points Based System (PBS). Students are also covered by the PBS.\nIn short, the system awards points to migrants based on their skills, qualifications and experience. Putting it very simplistically, a young applicant with a doctorate and proof of high earnings will earn more points than someone who is less skilled - and therefore find it's easier for them to come to the UK.\nThe PBS has five \"tiers\". Tiers one and two cover highly skilled and skilled migrants respectively. Tier three was designed for unskilled workers but has never been implemented. Tier four covers students and the final tier covers a host of temporary workers and special categories. This graphic shows the categories of migrants from outside Europe:\nSo is the coalition scrapping this system?\nNo. But they are reforming it to meet their long-term goal. They want to reduce net immigration to \"tens of thousands each year, not hundreds of thousands\" over the lifetime of the Parliament.\nNet immigration is the difference between those arriving and those leaving.\nThe government want to introduce an immigration cap to help achieve that goal and the first one is due to come into force in April 2011. This was a Conservative election pledge that was opposed by their coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.\nAnd how high is net immigration at the moment?\nThe latest official figures show that 196,000 more people came to the UK than left in 2009. That figure includes British citizens returning from living abroad and people from inside the EEA. In all, more than half a million people migrated to the UK in 2008 - and the figure has been rising over the long-term, in line with the experiences of many industrialised nations.\nWhat were immigration levels like in the 1980s?\nIt is difficult to compare official figures for immigration from the 1980s to more recent numbers because the method for calculating them has changed. Since 1991, there has been an attempt to take account of people applying for asylum or those extending their short-term visa to stay more permanently.\nAccording to the figures available, at the beginning of the 1980s the UK continued to see a net loss of migrants, as it had in the 1970s, with British citizens choosing to leave the UK. This wave of emigration peaked in 1981 when 108,000 British and EU citizens decided to leave and only 28,000 people arrived to settle in the UK.\nBut by 1983 more people were coming to live in the UK than were leaving. This reached a peak of 58,000 migrants in 1985, and the flow of people into the UK continued for every year for the rest of the decade, except 1988, setting a pattern that would continue into the 1990s.\nSo how will the government achieve its target?\nExperts say that if the government is to hit its target of reducing net migration, it has to pull levers that will slow long-term immigration while, at the same time, take steps to increase the rate of emigration.\nThe only problem is that there are not that many levers that can be pulled. Some 15% of people moving into the UK are returning British citizens, so their movements cannot be affected - but they are counted in the statistics.\nThe government cannot block EEA nationals who make up about a third of all arrivals.\nThe remaining half - about 280,000 people - are long-term arrivals from the rest of the world. These are the people whose movements can be influenced by policy changes.\nSo what does the cap involve - and how does it work?\nThe immigration cap for non-EEA workers for the year from April 2011 is 21,700 - about 6,300 lower than in 2009.\nOf those, 20,700 are tier two skilled migrants entering graduate occupations with a job offer and sponsorship.\nThe other 1,000 are people allowed in under a new \"exceptional talent\" route - people like scientists, academics and artists. The former tier one general route - open to highly skilled migrants without a job offer - will be closed.\nHowever, these limits do not apply to a category of workers who come to the UK in an \"intra-company transfer\" with their multinational employer. In other words, there will be other people coming in over and above the 21,700 limit.\nThere will be a new minimum salary of \u00a340,000 for firms using intra-company transfers (ICTs) for more than a year - but staff earning at least \u00a324,000 would still be able to come for up to 12 months.\nImmigration restrictions are being lifted for people earning more than \u00a3150,000 a year, while scientists will be given a \"significant advantage\" in their attempts to come to the UK to work.\nSo what else can the government do?\nAccording to Professor David Metcalf, chairman of the government's Migration Advisory Committee, students from outside the EEA make up 60% of the migrants whose movements can be restricted. He said in his recent report that the government cannot meet its target by restricting workers alone.\nThe following graph shows how highly skilled and skilled workers from outside the EEA make up a small part of the number of people applying for visas - although bear in mind that not all of those counted below are permanent or long-term immigrants:\nHome Secretary Theresa May says she is looking at how to cut their numbers - but it's not clear who will be targeted and whether the Liberal Democrats will accept restrictions.\nShe says her forthcoming consultation on students will focus on allowing in students who are studying for degrees or those joining \"highly trusted\" colleges. This is a controversial area. Languages colleges are big legitimate businesses - but it's widely accepted that there is also abuse where people use student visas as a means of coming to work in the UK. Another route that the home secretary will target is a mechanism that allows some students to take jobs at the end of their course.\nWhat about family reunion?\nFamilies make up the final 20% of migrants from outside the EEA - but curtailing their right to arrive will be difficult to achieve because of human rights law.\nHowever, the government is also looking at measures to boost the numbers leaving the UK by restricting rights to settle or to extend a work visa. Mrs May says she wants to end the link between temporary migration for work - and permanent settlement.\nWhat effect would a cap have?\nIt's very difficult to know before it has happened. A large number of businesses have complained that it could damage the economy - and Professor Metcalf has warned that there could be \"serious long-term consequences for investment and job generation\" if the restrictions on work visas were too tight.", "summary": "The coalition government has placed an annual limit on the number of immigrants allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.", "id": "10436228", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe coalition government has pledged to reduce net immigration to \"tens of thousands\" a year.\nThe government wants to reduce net immigration to \"tens of thousands\" a year.\nThe government wants to reduce net immigration to \"tens of thousands\" a year.\nThe government wants to reduce net immigration to \"tens of thousands\" a year.\nThe government wants to reduce net immigration to \"tens of thousands\" a year.", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe government has said that it is looking at how to cut their numbers -

You can't have one without the other.\"\nTraci Liebisch, who is responsible for inspecting the road bridge on a daily basis, says the bridge is a \"grand old lady\".\nShe says: \"I personally think she is quite an historic monument and Scotland should be proud of having a bridge like this.\n\"I think she's done not bad in her 50 years. I'm proud to work on a structure like this, that is known world-wide.\"\nBefore the road bridge opened on 4 September 1964, cars could only get across the Forth on a ferry.\nFour ferries criss-crossed the river, with services running every 15 minutes at its peak.\nEach ferry took about 30 cars, but they could also carry lorries and buses, caravans and passengers.\nStephen Reid, who was one of the ferry skippers, says that in the early 1950s the ferry could sit at the pier for 15 minutes and leave empty because nobody had cars.\n\"Then all of a sudden everybody had cars and we just could not cope,\" he says.\nConstruction of the bridge began in 1958.\nAt the time, the longest suspension bridge in the world was San Francisco's Golden Gate, and the bridge across the Forth was based on its distinctive design.\nBarry Colford, who is the current bridge master and chief engineer, says: \"All the traffic, all the load of the bridge, is suspended in mid-air. It is very simple.\n\"It is just like a rope bridge over the Andes, except it is made of steel.\"\nThe three large suspension bridges that had been built before the Forth had all been in more \"benign\" climates and there were worries about the stormy Scottish weather.\nHistorian Lillian King says: \"The thing they were afraid of was a repeat of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in America that shook itself to bits in gales not half the strength of the ones that hit the Forth.\"\nBarry Colford says: \"The Forth bridge had a stiffening girder because of the lessons learned at Tacoma in 1940.\"\nBy the time construction started in September 1958, the estimated cost of the bridge and its approach roads was \u00c2\u00a316.2m.\nNo company in the UK was large enough to take on the job alone so a consortium, the ACD bridge company, was formed.\nThe first job saw divers helping to build the dams that would allow water to be pumped out so the towers could be sunk into the river bed.\nOnce the newly-assembled steel towers were in place wire-mesh catwalks were installed high above the water to give the bridge workers access.\nJimmy Lafferty, the steel-erecting foreman, was officially acknowledged as the first man to walk across the river on foot using the catwalk.\nBut two young engineers had in fact made it across before the walkways were finished.\nHector Woodhouse, an assistant engineer on the bridge, says: \"They had not quite finished the mesh but we were not going to stopped.\"\nHis pal Alan MacDonald, a section engineer, adds: \"We did a tightrope act down the cables so that we could become the first people to cross the bridge.\"\nThe pair stepped off together to both claim to be first.\nThe antics of Hector and Alan confirm Lillian King's assertion that health and safety was nothing like as rigorous as it is today.\nShe says: \"Seven men died in the making of the bridge but only four men died on the bridge itself.\"\nOn 22 June 1962 the single worst accident of the whole bridge project was when Masterton viaduct, a large section of one of the approach roads, collapsed, trapping four men beneath it. Only one survived.\nOnce the towers and walkway were in place the next job was to spin the cables that would hold the bridge in place.\nThe main cable is made up of more than 11,000 high tensile steel wires and the process of \"spinning\" involved each individual wire being carried across the Forth on a large pulley system.\nThe work went on 24 hours a day. At either side of the river the wires were encased in concrete anchorages.\nThe spinning of the cable took nine months, with some 30,000 miles of wire being carried back and forth across the water.\nBy 1963, the towers and the cables were in place and the \"Meccano set\" work of erecting the deck could begin. It was built from the towers outwards\nMs King says: \"This is a precision piece of work. You see it come out bit by bit. It is like building a tunnel, you wonder if it is going to match up when you get to the middle point.\"\nOn the 20 December 1963, the north and south sections of the bridge were joined in the middle, forming the basis of the fourth longest suspended span of steel roadway in the world.\nCurrent bridge master Barry Colford says: \"The people who built the bridge and the engineers who designed it without computers, with seven-figure log tables, it is quite incredible how well it is built when you look at the tools they had to do it with.\"\nThe Forth Road Bridge was finally ready for its grand opening on 4 September 1964, a day so foggy the bridge could not be seen from the riverside.\nThe Queen officially opened the bridge and as her car drove across at 11am the fog started to lift.\nGeorge Barnett was a tea boy and handyman during the bridge's construction.\nHe was chosen for the honour of unfurling a flag before the Queen crossed the bridge.\nHe said: \"I was 18 when I hoisted the flag for the Queen. It was a great feeling.\n\"Three weeks after it we got paid off. That was the bridge finished. We all shook hands and went our different ways.\"\nDuring the six years it took to construct, amateur film-maker Jim Hendry was given special access to the bridge and the men who were building it.\nFifty years on, the men who built the bridge were invited to watch Mr Hendry's film and were still proud of what they achieved.\nHector Woodhouse says: \"Look at it. It is mathematics in action isn't it?\"\nAssistant engineer Douglas Strachan says: \"It was three-and-a-half years of my life and I can drive over it in one-and-a-half minutes, but there is satisfaction. I can see something as an end product to my civil engineering career.\"", "summary": "It is 50 years since the Forth Road Bridge opened to traffic, easing the crossing between Edinburgh and Fife and transforming the journey from north to south.", "id": "29010834", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Forth Road Bridge was opened in 1964.\nThe bridge was built in 50 years.\nThe bridge was built in 50 years ago.\nThe bridge was built in 1964.\nThe bridge was built in 1964.

And very slightly unnerved, too.\nWhat this means, in the brave new world of robotics, is that I have entered what scientists call the \"uncanny valley\", a state of uncertainty and discomfort about the nature of the entity I am talking to.\nAs the technology and software come closer to achieving some kind of human mimicry, understanding this strange mental zone is crucial to making robots more acceptable.\nAnd that is something advocates of robotics are determined to do - partly because huge new markets for robots have opened up and partly because there are all kinds of tasks that machines can do more safely than us.\nThe most obvious examples are robots that can be used as explorers of space or the deep ocean, or as scouts or even workers in the most radioactive parts of nuclear power stations.\nBut we are now on the brink of a new era as machines are developed to enter more sensitive areas of our lives - everything from hospital surgeries to our homes to care for the elderly.\nOne of the directors of the Edinburgh centre, Prof David Lane, says there is now \"a global race to be the country that develops the best smart robots\".\nIn the 1970s, Germany, Japan and South Korea quickly dominated the market for robots designed to work in factories.\n\"We want to be at the front of the race if we can,\" he says. \"We don't want to lose out the way we did with the first generation of industrial robots.\"\nSo how we interact with the new machines - and whether we like them - has become one of the most critical issues.\nAnd for many years, robots have played such a well-defined role in science fiction that we have come to assume that they should look and behave in certain ways, and to take for granted that they are fictitious.\nIn the Star Wars films, robots were friendly and comical. In the thriller Blade Runner, they were powerful and malevolent.\nSo, on meeting a robot, our minds struggle to process a combination of long-held expectations and startling new impressions.\nAmong those exploring the fascinating twilight realm of the interface between human and machine is Prof Ruth Aylett of Heriot-Watt University, which is part of the Edinburgh robotics centre along with Edinburgh University.\n\"You might think people would look at a robot and say, 'that's a lump of metal'. But research has shown that if it's responsive and has expressive behaviour, people will treat it as what we call a 'social actor' - in other words, as if it was a person, much the way we look at things in cartoons.\n\"We know that they are not real but we treat them as if they are real characters, as if they really had dreams and hopes like us - in other words, we suspend our disbelief.\n\"People do that with robots that have good interactive behaviour - we can't help ourselves.\"\nOvercoming the uncanny valley might seem impossible but it has already been achieved with one kind of robot, specifically designed to seem friendly and to serve as a tool to help dementia patients.\nKnown as Paro, this Japanese machine is modelled on a baby seal with adorably large eyes, soft white fur, a plaintive cry for attention and enough intelligence to be responsive to voices and touching.\nIn a country like Japan, with an ageing population increasingly at risk of being left alone, the idea of a robotic companion has a strong appeal.\nSome 3,500 Paro seals have been sold around the world, with several of these in use in the UK - and the experience seems to be generally positive.\nRon Abbott, an 85-year-old dementia sufferer, was among the first to encounter the robot in Britain, and a charming video shows him interacting with it, and laughing out loud as it responds.\nI held one of the Paro robots myself - it was surprisingly soft and heavy - and could not help warming to the way the robot flapped its fins, opened its eyes and uttered little cries to hold my gaze.\nTo me, it obviously wasn't real but it did feel more alive than a toy.\nFor Claire Jepson, who helps to manage the robots at the Grenoside Grange Hospital in Sheffield, nearly all her patients find some benefit in spending time with them, possibly because they are drawn to the machines' apparent vulnerability.\n\"Our patients experience a lot of distress when they come to us. Paro provides comfort, people begin to focus on this thing; the tactile stimulation calms them.\n\"They seem to be reassured by offering the seal reassurance; it's crying out, it's wanting to be looked after, as a lot of patients do.\"\nShe says the robots are an addition to patient care, not a substitute for it, but some critics have questioned whether the arrival of automated assistants will lead to a cut in staff numbers.\nThe advent of robots in care homes has also triggered a debate about the ethics of using machines for something as sensitive as supporting the elderly.\nProf Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield, who has led studies into robotics, declares himself to be fan of the technology. But he also warns that the implications of intelligent, mobile devices have not been thought through.\n\"Robots could help nurses lift an old person or be used to protect you from cutting yourself with a knife or leaving your cooker on,\" he says, before going on to outline some risks.\n\"We need to look at privacy. Imagine an old lady living at home: she's in the bathroom, and there's one of these robots patrolling round looking for her, and you don't know who's looking through the camera.\n\"It comes into the bathroom and she's standing there naked. Well, who's at the other side of that? Is there somebody smirking and giggling? So there should be some way of knocking, a design that allows you to have your privacy and your dignity.\"\nAwareness of the potentially negative impacts of robots has led designers to concentrate on ensuring that, for a start, they are safe.\nProf Sethu Vijayakumar, a director of the Edinburgh centre, shows me a project where a robot is being taught to avoid touching a human - whenever one of the researchers reaches towards the robot, the machine twists its arm out of the way.\nFor him, the research focus is on what is called \"shared autonomy\" - where humans remain in control while delegating certain tasks to robots.\nThat allows people to retain oversight but at the same time to exploit the strength and precision of the machines. Full autonomy lies in the much more distant future.\nAnd what if a robot went rogue? I ask, eyeing a robotic hand strapped to his left arm and occasionally twitching.\n\"At this stage, there's very little risk of that,\" Prof Vijayakumar says.\n\"We still have significant control of the electronics, the Artificial Intelligence - and there's a kill button.\"\nAlong with \"uncanny valley and \"shared autonomy\", \"kill button\" is a crucial phrase in the robotics field.\nAs long as people remain nervous of the machines malfunctioning or becoming too powerful, an off-switch - a last-ditch of human control - will always be needed.", "summary": "The robot's eyes flick towards me, and its head turns, eyebrows raised, lips forming a smile, as if we are about to meet and start a conversation.", "id": "32028539", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe article is about the uncanny valley and the \"kill button\" in robotics.\nThe uncanny valley is a psychological phenomenon in which a robot or other artificial entity is perceived as unsettling or creepy because it looks almost human, but not quite.\nThe kill button is a last-ditch of human control that will always be needed.\nThe article is about the uncanny valley and the \"kill button\" in robotics.", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\n\"The robots are not going to take over the world.

Bin).\nThe possibility that the next Labour leader will be the old stalwart of the Islington left, Jeremy Corbyn.\nMy course was in \"hostile environments\" and one of the things you learn is the danger of minefields - stick to the well-trodden middle path, don't go into the areas either side marked with red flags, for there death lurks.\nThis is Labour's sin in the eyes of the commentariat: that they are being lured, by the vision of a man with a beard, into the explosive land of red flags.\n\"You can only win on the centre ground!\" is the complacent chorus.\nNo-one can doubt elections are won in the centre. Just ask Alexis Tsipras. Or Marine Le Pen.\nThe commentators are not exactly wrong. It's just they are right for all the wrong reasons, misunderstanding, unwittingly or for ideological purpose, the meaning of the centre.\nBut before we eviscerate the middle ground let us lie the swooning Labour party down on the sofa, usher out the maiden aunts, and urge everyone to take a pace back.\nComplacency is never wise, but perhaps a bit of perspective is valuable.\nWe may be at a critical break point, but we may not. Democratic politics tends to go in cycles.\nAfter a longish time in government, which ends in defeat and disappointment, it takes a while for the electorate to trust that party again.\nIt always feels terminal at the time. After Obama's victory in 2008 there were magazine headlines \"the death of the Republican Party\", without even a cautious question mark.\nTwo years after that they won the House, then in 2014 the Senate. Along the way they have collected a clutch of governorships.\nThey are not in the White House, they have serious problems, but dead, they ain't.\nOr ask William Hague about baseball caps, saving the pound and what it was like to be Conservative leader of the opposition in 1997.\nLabour are perhaps simply having their William Hague moment.\nThe grim news for them is that they still have to endure their equivalent of IDS and Michael Howard before finding a Cameron analogue.\nThe Conservatives' slow crawl back to electability was straight from the Tony Blair playbook, so it is hardly surprising that people have drawn the lesson that wooing your own hardliners fails, and moving to the middle works.\nBut times change.\nI am not playing down the fact that a Corbyn victory would be a moment of extreme trauma for Labour, would leave them branded unelectable by friend and foe alike and would raise ghosts from those who lived through the Bennite civil war and the formation of the breakaway SDP.\nBut that inevitability says something about the narrowness of debate, and the dangerous lure of the centre ground.\nCorbyn after all, appears to be calling for a higher tax rate for the better-off, not the nationalisation of the commanding heights of the economy.\nIt is hardly surprising that Westminster journalists crave the ideologically soft centre.\nNone is on the minimum wage, let alone tax credits, nor are any, to my knowledge, owners of third homes on the Cayman Islands, or running big corporations.\nThey are nearly all university educated and live in London or the South East of England (Yes, all that goes for me, too).\nThere is group-think in the muddled middle, a fear of thinking outside a comfortable box.\nThey, like the politicians they write about, may dwell too much on the mechanics of winning, maintaining and exercising power, rather than why they want it in the first place.\nThis rather mechanistic approach excludes the real reason why most people get involved in politics - it also explains, why, increasingly these days, they don't bother.\nIt underscores why Jeremy Corbyn appeals to many Labour members.\nHe, like they, wants to change things.\nYou may label these ideas old-fashioned, or unworkable, but they are passionately held.\nTo them principle is important.\nFruitlessly opposing what they see as attacks on the poorest seems more noble than cunningly shadowing the Conservatives, in the apparent hope that no-one will spot the difference between the two parties.\nNot long before I left the US, I was talking at a Tea Party convention to a couple of activists about who they wanted as the next Republican candidate.\nOne said, echoing the Buckley rule: \"I want the most conservative guy who's electable.\"\n\"That's where I'm different,\" chimed in his friend. \"I want the most conservative. Period.\"\nThere will be Labour Party members who echo the sentiment, if not the political direction.\nTo them it looks as if becoming a leading Labour politician has become about how many of your core beliefs you are willing to jettison to get into power.\nThis suspicion, from activists, creates uncomfortable echoes in the wider electorate.\nThere is a sizeable proportion of voters who don't like any of the main parties very much, and don't trust politicians.\nWhat they don't like is the idea that politicians are in it for themselves, don't tell the truth, and will say anything to get elected.\nA Labour leader who gives the impression that they are getting rid of most of the distinctively Labour bits of their policy, perhaps with the intention of smuggling them back in again at a later date, starts out doing the splits over the authenticity gap.\nSocial Democrats once had the luxury of rather impatiently accusing old-style socialists of clinging to the wreckage of the past.\nNow social democrats themselves are holding tight to levers that are no longer attached to anything.\nAll but the most rarefied politicians must have noticed that real, walking, breathing voting human beings have a luxury they don't - to believe several contradictory things at the same time.\nThe world outside Westminster is a confusing place.\nIs it really true that many people who voted Liberal Democrat in 2010 voted UKIP this year? Well, yes it is.\nConstructing centre-ground politics to attract these wayward souls is more complex than pick-and-mix.\nIt is axiomatic that elections are won on the centre ground - it is obvious that to win you have to shift people from one party to another.\nIf you like, that is the centre ground. But it is where metaphor can be misleading.\nThe Venn diagram does not only consist of circles marked left and right.\nPeople may be divided almost equally between preferring Marmite or marmalade on their morning toast, but it isn't a winning formula to mix the two spreads.\nI'd suggest the centre is something more profound - shared desires that go way beyond ideology.\nThe centre ground of Tsipras (who ironically does now govern from the centre, but that's another story) was hope and a rejection of despair.\nFor Le Pen, it is perhaps a fear of change and a frustration with a grim economic future.\nCameron won the centre ground of competence - Ed Miliband was seen as extreme, but not because of the mansion tax.\nHe was seen as extremely unlikely to be a good prime minister.\nElections are won in the centre ground - but that means shared perceptions of competence and charisma, hopes and fears, not a nauseating mixture of Marmite and marmalade.", "summary": "I've been off on a course for a week or so and feel rather detached from the news of the day.", "id": "33687369", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe centre ground is not a place where you can mix and match.\nIt is a place where you have to be true to yourself.\nIf you are not, you will be found out.\nThe centre ground is not a place where you can mix and match.

And there's tremendous room to grow.\nIn the US, there are 40,000 movie screens, or one for every 8,000 people, according to EntGroup. There are 20,000 screens in China, but that works out as one for every 70,000 people. And with nearly 100 new screens being built every week, Chinese movie goers are poised to take over as the biggest market in the world.\nIt's no wonder that big Hollywood movies are catering to the Chinese audience. Iron Man 3 included a special scene with Chinese A-list actors that was only seen in China.\nBut does it mean that it's another golden age for Chinese cinema?\nAfter all, Hollywood films make up half of the top 10 highest grossing movies in China. The most popular movie is the latest Transformers flick.\nThe Chinese government certainly wants to renew its film industry to challenge Hollywood. And when they want to show that something matters, they go big and they've built the world's largest film museum.\nChinese cinema has been around for over a century.  That's about as old as Hollywood.  The very first movie in China was made in 1905.  It was the Peking opera-themed flick, Ding Jing Mountain.\nThe late 1920s and 1930s was when Chinese films flourished. The industry was centred in Shanghai, which was the most cosmopolitan city in Asia at the time. Foreigners mingled with Chinese filmmakers. That was when the first Chinese movie stars were launched.  And that era is known as the Golden Age of Chinese cinema.\nIt came to an end when the Communist Party came to power in 1949. Films were seen as tools for propaganda and filmmakers lost their creative freedom.\nThe worst period for Chinese cinema was unsurprisingly during the Cultural Revolution.  Bourgeois pursuits like filmmaking were prohibited.  In fact, there were no feature films made between 1966 and 1973. Needless to say, it decimated the industry.\nAs normal life resumed and China opened up in 1978, film was slowly revived. Movies such as Farewell My Concubine won the top prize at the Cannes film festival in 1993. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero seemed to usher in a new era for film.\nBut most Chinese movies have yet to breakthrough globally. And no Chinese film has ever won an Oscar for Best Picture.\nBut it's changing. I met Lu Chuan, one of China's most promising young directors, who is taking on his first big commercial film. He has brought in CGI experts from Hollywood who had worked on World War Z, and created a rare international team to crew a Chinese sci-fi, action movie.\nThat's all possible because of the fast-growing box office. Where there's appetite, there's money for films. Plus, the Chinese government protects the industry by imposing a quota on the number of foreign films that can be shown each year. Does this create a perfect storm to launch another golden age for Chinese movies?\nLu Chuan says it's the best of times but also the worst of times. Chasing money at the box office plus censorship means that comedies are favoured and there are subjects that aren't touched by filmmakers.\nIt has taken him 18 months to get a script approved. He told me that he misses the days when he was a student at the Beijing Film Academy and made films based on dreams.\nGradually, films like Lu Chuan's are beginning to tell a universal story. Could this be the next generation of movies to rival Hollywood?\nYou can't have a new golden age without the superstars whose influence extends beyond the big screen, and China already has some very popular movie stars.\nI met Yao Chen, who may be the most influential star with over 70 million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter. She's also the first Chinese goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Her aspiration, she told me isn't to go to Hollywood but to be in a Chinese film that wins the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.\nBut could China soon produce a truly global hit? Even Chinese box office winners don't do well globally. The record-breaking comedy Lost in Thailand generated nearly $200m in China but only $60,000 in the US.\nUnsurprisingly, censorship is an issue.\nEarlier this year, the police shut down the 11th Beijing Independent Film Festival and confiscated footage from more than 70 filmmakers.\nAfter being released from police detention, organiser Li Xianting told me: \"I don't know what the government is worried about. I have wondered all these years.\n\"The authorities have always been scared of filmmakers and artists and our discussions during the screening event. I don't understand that. If the government wants to create a golden age for film, they should provide a more open and liberal environment for us.\"\nThere's also the long-standing issue of piracy. An estimated nine out of 10 DVDs in China are fake. With $6bn in sales, that's more than the annual box office take.\nDemand for pirated DVDs is falling as more people want the actual experience of going to the cinema, but it's still a challenge for the industry that typically relies on DVDs, online streaming, and associated merchandise to generate revenues beyond the box office.\nThere is another source of revenue that the Chinese film industry has already jumped on. Hengdian is the world's largest outdoor movie lot. It's larger than the two biggest US movie studios, Paramount and Universal, put together. There's even an exact, full-size replica of the Forbidden City in Beijing.\nAnd they're even rebuilding the Old Summer Palace, burned down by Western troops during the Qing Dynasty, not in Beijing but in Zhejiang province. No wonder Hengdian is known as China's Hollywood and was the sixth most visited tourist destination in China last year.\nAmerican studios are also getting into the market. Universal Studios is building a theme park in Beijing and a Disneyland that is four times larger than the one in Hong Kong is planned for Shanghai.\nBut China's Hollywood may soon be supplanted by a new domestic project in Qingdao. Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin plans to build the world's biggest movie studio there and launched his effort with an A-list Hollywood cast, including Nicole Kidman and Harvey Weinstein among others.\nWang Jianlin has also bought AMC theatres in the US. It's all part of Chinese firms going global, and the film industry is certainly taking advantage of the push.\nWhen I met Dan Mintz, boss of the Chinese studio that co-produced Iron Man III, he told me that the next stage is to have a Chinese studio produce a global, Hollywood film. That would upset the century-long dominance of Hollywood by six American studios.\nHow a film does in China is already part of the \"green light\" process for big Hollywood franchises. If the next stage is that films are not just sold but created in China then it would be another step forward in the re-emergence of China.\nAnother golden age where Chinese films have the same cultural pull as Hollywood would say a great deal about China's ability to innovate and be creative. Those are the very traits that have cemented US dominance beyond its economic might.\nIf one day we all wanted to be part of Chinese cinematic magic, then China would truly rival the US.\nFor more, watch a special Talking Business with Linda Yueh, part of the Designed in China season.

Decide in an instant, live with the repercussions for an age. Stick or twist? Red or black? Kick or corner?\"\nBut South Africa were making their few chances count. Lambie made it 6-9 after referee Nigel Owens spotted hands in the ruck, and Tom Youngs was penalised for a crooked line-out to cost his side further momentum.\nBetter was to come. A slicing break from Alex Goode after a frantic spell on halfway brought the crowd to full voice; Flood tried a grubber into space for Manu Tuilagi to run on to but over-cooked it.\nTurnover deep in home territory opened a possible overlap that Ben Youngs - perhaps conscious of his over-adventure last week - chose to kick deep instead, and full-back Zane Kirchner did well to cover and kick clear.\nIf South Africa were a touch fortunate to lead at the break, there was a significant slice of luck about the try that followed soon after the interval.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nA rebound from an attempted kick through gave them territory, and when Juandre Kruger dropped the ball five yards out Youngs' hack clear hit JP Pietersen, eluded Ben Morgan and fell into the grateful grasp of a surprised Alberts a yard out as he flopped over the line.\nLambie added the conversion for 6-16, and as the rain fell the outlook darkened for the men in white.\nOnly when Manu Tuilagi burst away on an intercept from his own 22 did the atmosphere lift. The centre found Chris Ashton on his inside as he ran out of gas, but the winger's pass to Brown outside him was poor and the opening was gone.\nEngland's struggles at the line-out were intensifying. A fourth loss off their own throw brought a grimace from hooker Youngs, and there was a lack of precision when the ball was put through hands.\nFarrell brought it back to 9-16 with 18 minutes left on the clock after Springbok hands in the ruck, but there was a distinct absence of composure and the kicking from hand was poor.\nProlonged pressure and territory failed to yield points. Farrell was struggling to fire the attack; the difficult conditions led to handling errors, and stout defence - with Eben Etzebeth outstanding - snuffed out the rest.\nReplacement prop Mako Vunipola  spilt the ball when looking to rumble, yet a Springbok error on their own scrum and forwards going off their feet at subsequent ruck gave Farrell an easy penalty for 12-16.\n\"Let's not forget South Africa are the second best team in the world and England will be absolutely devastated they couldn't go on and win it. I think we must remember Chris Robshaw is a relatively inexperienced player and doing a great job, but kicking for the corner was the right option at the end. I was a little bit surprised at the decision to turn down a penalty on the halfway line before that which would have given them the opportunity in the last five minutes to go on and win the game. I do think England did a lot better today and played the conditions very well. They  will count themselves unlucky and rue a fortuitous South Africa try, which kind of dealt them a hammer blow, and some of those Toby Flood missed penalties in the first half, as well as those key decisions in the second half.\"\nAt last the capacity 81,000 crowd began to believe. A scrum penalty on halfway was kicked to touch to set up an attacking line-out on the Springbok 22, and the forwards took it up until replacement hooker David Paice knocked on to howls of dismay.\nThe seconds ticked away, England battering against a green wall and making minimal inroads.\nWith two minutes left, a lifeline. South Africa were penalised again, but rather than kicking to touch, Farrell was instructed by Robshaw to take the three points that made it 15-16.\nIt was a calculated gamble greeted with boos from many in the crowd and when the Springboks took control from the restart it was one that failed.\nA game that was winnable had slipped away, and England's weary players sank to their knees as the final whistle sounded.\nEngland: Goode, Ashton, Tuilagi, Barritt, Brown, Flood, B.

And Arsenal were ahead on the hour when a penalty-box rebound struck Marco Verratti and flew in.\nPSG were always dangerous and Lucas' header, which took a touch off Alex Iwobi, gave them a fully-deserved equaliser 13 minutes from time.\nCavani then missed two good chances and although Arsenal and PSG are level on points, the French champions have the advantage on head-to-head away goals with one round of games left after a 1-1 draw between the teams in Paris earlier in the group.\nArsenal's inability to top their Champions League group has cost them dearly as they have failed to get past the last 16 in the past six years - and they now face the same fate again.\nThe odds now seem stacked in favour of Unai Emery's side, but the side that finishes top could yet end up facing the likes of Real Madrid or Bayern Munich.\nPSG face Ludogorets at home in their final game, the team Arsenal beat 6-0 at Emirates Stadium, while Wenger's side travel to Basel.\nThere is still an opportunity for late twists but it is starting to look like second again after this enthralling draw.\nThey will be entering familiar territory after reaching the last 16 every season in the Champions League's current format, which has been in existence since 2003-04.\nArsenal have suffered in finishing second. Those exits at the last-16 stage in the past six seasons have included two losses to Barcelona, two to Bayern Munich and one each to AC Milan and Monaco.\nArsenal may not have been at their best here but they once again showed the resilience that manager Arsene Wenger believes is starting to become their trademark.\nWenger hinted at this new-found strength in his programme notes, written after they grabbed a late point at Manchester United in the Premier League.\nHe said: \"We were resilient, we came back and we've done that many times this season. I believe we have the quality and the spirit on the bench now and that combination makes us remarkably resilient until the last minute.\"\nArsenal were outplayed until they got a penalty in first-half injury time and while they hardly sparkled in the second half they at least dug deep to earn a point that could yet prove vital.\nCavani has forged a reputation as one of the world's most formidable strikers - and he was on target here again when he slid in to turn home Matuidi's cross to put PSG ahead after 18 minutes.\nThe Uruguayan's runs into space are magical but he could have made Arsenal's plight much worse with two glaring second half misses, one when he broke clear and went for a Hollywood chipped finish that David Ospina saved, and a point-blank header he directed wide from Lucas' cross.\nCavani has the record of a quality player - but he let Arsenal off the hook.\nArsenal return to Premier League action on Sunday when they host Bournemouth at Emirates Stadium in a match that starts at 14:15 GMT.\nMatch ends, Arsenal 2, Paris Saint Germain 2.\nSecond Half ends, Arsenal 2, Paris Saint Germain 2.\nCorner,  Paris Saint Germain.

Jags put his head down a little bit,\" Delaney said afterwards.\nPalace also questioned why Delaney's second-half header from Ward's clipped pass was ruled out for offside.\nDelaney was in an onside position when the cross came in but television replays showed team-mate James McArthur had strayed offside and was perhaps blocking Maarten Stekelenburg's view when the defender headed the ball into the net.\nBut there was still confusion after the match. Delaney said he been told by the officials that McArthur had been penalised, while Eagles manager Alan Pardew claimed assistant referee Simon Bennett told him Delaney was offside.\n\"I gather the TV replays show Damien wasn't offside,\" said Pardew. \"If that's what the assistant referee's call was then we can feel a bit hard done by on that one.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEverton and Palace rely on burly Belgians to spearhead their attacks, so it was no surprise to see both Lukaku and Benteke on the scoresheet.\nThe pair are battling for Belgium's number nine shirt and there was little to choose between them at Goodison Park.\nWhile Koeman has told Lukaku that he must press opposing defences more, his finishing is clinical - and he again demonstrated his ability by bending in his fifth goal in three Premier League matches.\nBut former Liverpool striker Benteke was not to be outdone.\nThe \u00a327m summer signing has provided a much-needed physical presence up front for Palace, and used his aerial ability to pull his side level.\nHe showed intelligence to peel off Jagielka and move to the far post, where he rose above Seamus Coleman to direct a wonderful header into the opposite corner.\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman:\n\"It's a good point in the end. We defended set plays and second balls well against a difficult team.\n\"The team performance was outstanding, although we'd like to create more opportunities.\n\"We've had a good start to the season. The position in the table is not everything at the moment and we need to improve, but we're doing a good job.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew:\n\"I thought we played very well and showed our quality and resilience by coming back from behind again.\n\"Everton had a couple of spells early on where you could see their quality.

It is 17 straight league wins since then for the champions.\nCeltic were missing some amount of firepower, with Moussa Dembele ruled out because of a knee injury and Leigh Griffiths missing with a sore calf. Stuart Armstrong didn't make it either, even though he was named in the starting line-up. The midfielder suffered a recurrence of a calf problem in the warm-up and was replaced by McGregor.\nHe was not a bad deputy as it turned out. It was McGregor's goal, after half an hour, that sent Celtic on their way to a record.\nThe goal was clinical, with Celtic taking advantage of the softness in the Hearts defence. Sinclair had begun as an emergency centre-forward but soon moved to his usual spot wide on the left - and it was from there that he created it. He cut through a gap with ease and then picked out the on-rushing McGregor, who beat Jack Hamilton with a shot that went in off the inside of his left-hand post.\nIn the absence of Arnaud Djoum, Faycal Rherras - at the Africa Cup of Nations - and the injured Callum Paterson, Ian Cathro is throwing new players into his team on a weekly basis.\nMohammed Choulay was the latest to make a debut, off the bench, and there are more players to follow, it seems. They are needed - in all areas.\nHearts did not raise much of a gallop in the opening half. The only time they created a frisson of excitement for their supporters was when Celtic gifted them possession, which happened a number of times. Craig Gordon, a much-talked about goalkeeper, was guilty twice and had Hearts had any composure they might have made the Chelsea target suffer. They didn't.\nThey looked vulnerable at the back - John Souttar had a poor day, which got worse as he was carried off on a stretcher a few minutes from the end with what appeared to be a serious Achilles injury. They had little presence in the middle of the park and nothing to speak of up front. Having sold Igor Rossi and Alim Ozturk, they will wait anxiously for news of Souttar's injury.\nCeltic could have made it two but James Forrest was denied by a fine covering tackle by Liam Smith. Hearts then, finally, found something when Martin forced a save from Gordon. That was it for them. They were over-run from that point on.\nRodgers' team were unimpressive for the first hour, operating in third gear, which was still good enough to control the game. They raised their tempo later on, not long after that minor scare from Martin.\nAnd it was Tierney who took hold of things, pinging in a low cross form the left which Aaron Hughes failed badly to deal with. Sinclair slid in to score the second. Minutes later, from a clever Liam Henderson ball, Tierney cut it back to Roberts for the third.\nWhen Lennard Sowah took down substitute Jack Aitchison in the dying minutes, Sinclair made it four from the penalty spot. Even without their two principal attackers, and not hitting their straps the way we know they can, Celtic swatted Hearts aside. That's two wins in eight for Cathro now.

The majority, 53%, were released - raising the question as to why they'd been incarcerated at all.\nThat sense of grievance about being locked up appears to fuel the anger of detainees and undoubtedly contributes to their distress.\nStephen Shaw, a former prison and probation ombudsman, says it is an area he is focusing on in his review of the health and wellbeing of detainees at institutions across the immigration estate, which was commissioned in February by Theresa May, the Home Secretary.\n\"One of the issues I'm looking at is the impact of the fact of detention, the length of detention and the indeterminacy of detention on physical and mental health,\" says Mr Shaw.\n\"There's significant evidence that we've been given which indicates that detention affects physical and mental health in a damaging way.\"\nShaw's report won't be completed until September, but it's understood he's already been struck by the very high numbers of women in detention who have health problems.\nA separate inquiry is looking specifically at Yarl's Wood.\nThe private firm Serco, which has been awarded an eight-year, \u00c2\u00a370m contract to continue running the centre, established the review in March when allegations against its staff emerged following the secret Chanel 4 filming.\nIn a statement at the time, the company said: \"Serco works hard to ensure that the highest standards are maintained at Yarl's Wood.\n\"We recognise that the public needs to be confident that Yarl's Wood is undertaking its difficult role with professionalism, care and humanity.\n\"This is why we have asked the highly respected former barrister, Kate Lampard CBE, to conduct an independent review of our work at Yarl's Wood.\"\nLampard's review is also likely to be finalised towards the end of the year, by which time Nick Hardwick will have published his latest Yarl's Wood inspection report.\nThe findings are keenly awaited, particularly whether his previous recommendation that more female staff be recruited has been acted upon.\nSeptember 2003: Inspector of prisons found provision was \"not safe\".\nMarch 2004:  Prisons and probation ombudsman found evidence of a number of racist incidents.\nOctober 2004: Prisons and probation ombudsman found use of sprinklers could have prevented fire damage that resulted from a disturbance among detainees in 2002.\nFebruary 2006: Chief inspector of prisons found substantial gaps in services.\n2006: Legal Action for Women found that 70% of women had reported rape, nearly half had been detained for more than three months, 57% had no legal representation, and 20% had lawyers who demanded payment in advance.\nApril 2009: Children's commissioner for England found children held in the detention centre are denied urgent medical treatment, handled violently and left at risk of serious harm.\nApril 2014: UN's special rapporteur on violence against women, Rashida Manjoo, was barred from Yarl's Wood by the Home Office when she tried to investigate complaints as part of her fact-finding mission into violence against women in the UK.\nIn 2013, when 58% of custody officers at the mainly female Yarl's Wood were male, Hardwick said the issue needed addressing as a \"matter of urgency\".\nIn the meantime, a campaign to close Yarl's Wood is gathering momentum.\nLast weekend, several hundred protestors, most of them women, staged a noisy rally outside the centre, tearing down outer fencing, waving placards and shouting: \"Shut it down.\"\nThe move has high-profile backing - from Lady Helena Kennedy QC; Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty; Natalie Bennett, leader of the Greens - as well as from Conservative MP Richard Fuller, who represents Bedford and Kempston.\nBut the campaign has broader aims - to improve the overall treatment in Britain of asylum seekers and immigrants: Yarl's Wood has become a symbol for it, which is not what government ministers can have envisaged when we were shown around the gleaming new building back in 2001.", "summary": "Fourteen years ago, the Home Office invited me, along with other reporters, to see its brand new immigration removal centre, Yarl's Wood, in Bedfordshire.", "id": "33043395", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Home Office has said it is \"committed to ensuring that the detention of migrants is used only as a last resort and for the shortest possible time\".\nBut the government has also said it wants to increase the number of people detained, and the number of days they are held.\nThe Home Office says it is \"committed to ensuring that the detention of migrants is used only as a last resort and for the shortest possible time\".\nBut", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Home Office has said it is \"committed to improving the experience of those detained at Yarl's Wood\" and that it is \"committed to improving the experience of those detained at Yarl's Wood\".\nThe Home Office has said it is \"committed to improving the experience of those detained at Yarl's Wood\" and that it is \"committed to improving the experience of those detained at Yarl", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe campaign to close Yarl's Wood has been gathering momentum.\nThe campaign to close Yarl's Wood has been gathering momentum.\nThe campaign to close Yarl's Wood has been gathering momentum.\nThe campaign to close Yarl's Wood has been gathering momentum.\nThe campaign to close Yarl's Wood has been gathering momentum.\nThe campaign to close Yarl's Wood has been gathering", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yarl's Wood.\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yarl's Wood.\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yarl's Wood.\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yarl's Wood.\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yarl's Wood.\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yarl's Wood.\nThe campaign to improve the situation in Yar", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\n1.

For example, if Zlatan Ibrahimovic signs for another year at Manchester United and they come in for Lukaku, then he would be thinking: why would I go there now when I won't be playing every week?\nWhichever club you name, if Lukaku joins them for next season and plays 45 games, scores 25 goals and wins a trophy, then he will have made the right choice. If he doesn't, then the argument will be that he should have stayed at Everton for another year, where he will definitely play and his stock could rise even higher.\nIt is a case of seeing who wants him, having that conversation with them about what his role would be and making a decision. As a player it is hard to know what the right choice is sometimes, but it is not a bad situation for him to be in, really.\nLukaku is the Premier League's leading scorer with 21 goals but his hold-up play still gets criticised when people question how good he is.\nI actually think his touch is OK - yes it could be better, but there are not many top-flight strikers who are brilliant at link-up play. Costa can also be a bit sloppy at times, and Tottenham's Harry Kane is probably the best at it.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn any case, it is something that Lukaku can work on, along with his awareness. He will have to - the bigger the team you play for, the more packed defences you face and the less space you have to operate in.\nBut he is still young - he turns 24 next month - and those are the parts of your game that you can improve.\nIt is not just something that comes with age either. That development comes with playing with better players, who give you better quality balls from closer range.\nHis main asset as a striker, though, is his ability to score goals - with his right foot, left foot and his head.\nThat is a gift, and he does it so well that I really don't think the other parts of his game are a weakness, or would be a worry for any club buying him.\nAnother claim I hear about Lukaku is that he does not perform against the big teams, and it is true that most of his goals this season have come against lesser sides.\nBut that is true for most Premier League strikers, and there is a logical reason why.\nWhen Everton play the top teams they do not have as much possession or create as many chances, and Lukaku is up against better defenders too.\nHe scored against Tottenham last month, but he is not going to go White Hart Lane and cause Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld as many problems as he does when he faces Sunderland's defence at the Stadium of Light, playing two centre-halves who are low on confidence and with Everton seeing loads of the ball.\nThe time when questions come is when you are a striker playing in a top team and you are not scoring against the other top teams.\nBut it is hard to judge Lukaku like that because he has not played against many big teams while being on an equal footing.\nThat is the opportunity a move to, say, Chelsea would provide him with - the step-up to play for a team that is going to give you more chances in every game, whoever the opposition.\nThere is nothing wrong with having that ambition. In fact, it is completely normal.\nLukaku's refusal to sign a new Everton contract has been well publicised, and it means that when he plays people are looking for evidence that he is not happy, or does not care.\nI don't think that is the case, and I don't agree with the claims he did not try hard enough in Tuesday's draw with Manchester United.\nThe on-pitch argument that Lukaku had with Ashley Williams seemed to start with Williams asking him to chase the ball more - my understanding from watching it was that he wanted Lukaku to get across the pitch when a couple of clearances went on the opposite side to where he was standing.\nWhat I would say in Lukaku's defence was that he was very isolated and he could not really win, especially because many of the balls up to him were generally pretty poor - there is only so much pressing you can do when you are outnumbered.\nI certainly didn't see a Lukaku who wasn't trying for his team.\nYes, he lost the ball too easily sometimes, and of course that means you are going to get a volley off the players behind you, because they want a rest. \"Get hold of it, man\" is the kind of thing they would be shouting.\nBut in terms of his work ethic and his running, then it looked to me like he was giving the same physical output as I've seen from him in games where he has played well and scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLukaku's fall-out with Williams at Old Trafford was a mountain out of a mole-hill as far as I am concerned, because that sort of thing happens all the time.\nYes, Lukaku shushing him was a little bit condescending, but I have been shushed before and I have probably shushed people myself. It is not the end of the world.\nIt does not mean there is a serious rift between the pair of them. Quite the opposite, probably.\nAs a player, I had loads of rows with my team-mates during games and you quickly forget about it. When you have calmed down you have a handshake and a hug and everything is fine.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI remember one with Steven Gerrard when I was at Liverpool in a game against Leeds. He was my room-mate at the time and we were best buddies, but I had messed up in midfield and lost the ball after dwelling on it, and he had a right good go at me.\nIt was along the lines of \"sort yourself out and get yourself going quickly\" but not in those exact words, and I responded, very defensively, along similar lines without registering that he was actually right.\nEven though the way I acted was poor, the volley he gave me actually did get me going, and I realised that after the game.\nI apologised for coming back at him the way I did, and told him he was right but he just said don't worry, it is done with now - and that was that.\nThat is the way it should be, and I would be shocked if Williams and Lukaku had not sorted things out in the dressing room after the match or, at the very latest, in training the next day.\nIt didn't really matter who was right, and who was wrong, but I actually saw Lukaku's reaction as a positive. He cares, and wants to do well for the team.\nThat sort of passion is part of the game and it would be more of a worry for Everton - or any prospective buyers - if he didn't show any.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "Everton striker Romelu Lukaku could have a big decision to make in the summer.", "id": "39521532", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nLukaku is a fantastic athlete who scores lots of goals but he is still learning the game and, under the right coach and around better players, he is going to get better - the question is, where?\nEverton are an ambitious club and a fantastic platform for Lukaku to continue his development but if a Champions League side come in for him and tell him he is going to be first choice, there is not much of an argument for him to", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI think it is a shame that Lukaku is not going to be at Everton next season.\nI think he is a fantastic player and I think he will be a fantastic player for someone else.\nI think he is a fantastic player and I think he will be a fantastic player for someone else.\nI think he is a fantastic player and I think he will be a fantastic player for someone else", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nI think it is a shame that people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.\nI think it is a shame that people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.\nI think it is a shame that people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.\nI think it is a shame that people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.\nI think it is a shame that people are trying to make a mountain out", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nI think it is important to remember that Lukaku is a good player, and that he is a good guy.\nI think he is a good player, and I think he is a good guy.\nI think he is a good player, and I think he is a good guy.\nI think he is a good player, and I think he is a good guy.\nI think he is a good player, and I think he is a good gu", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nLukaku's fall-out with Williams at Old Trafford was a mountain out of a mole-hill as far as I am concerned, because that sort of thing happens all the time.\nYes, Lukaku shushing him was a little bit condescending, but I have been shushed before and I have probably shushed people myself.

They pressed and harried much closer to the Celtic goal and the home side never found their usual fluency and rhythm.\nWith Amoo capable of troubling Miller, and Azeez aggressive enough to discomfort the two Celtic centre-backs, there was promise for the visitors to build on. The best of their play, though, came through the creative figure of Edwards.\nThe Australian was quick and nimble enough to make a mark on the game despite opposing Celtic captain Scott Brown.\nOne burst past Brown led to Edwards feeding Azeez and the striker's awkward finish was brushed wide by Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon.\nThe visitors' lack of composure in the final third was a feature - Azeez had another low drive pushed wide by Gordon, while Ziggy Gordon's finish lacked conviction after the full-back galloped into the penalty area - but they kept Celtic on their heels at times.\nWhen Chris Erskine mis-hit the ball from a cross, it bounced to Sean Welsh, but he shot tamely straight at Gordon.\nMatch ends, Celtic 1, Partick Thistle 0.\nSecond Half ends, Celtic 1, Partick Thistle 0.\nAttempt missed.

Eriksen, arguably the best player on the pitch, delivered a teasing cross from the left that Wes Brown tried to clear only to see it ricochet in off Adebayor.\nKane scored his first Premier League goal after the break. Eriksen was again the supply line, finding the 20-year-old Englishman with an in-swinging ball that was tucked away from close range.\nThe Dane was pulling the strings in attack and moments later demonstrated his own ability in front of goal with well-placed sidefoot effort past Mannone.\nSunderland were then caught out again in defence, when Brown's attempt to head the ball clear found Kane, whose shot was saved by the Sunderland keeper only for Adebayor to touch in.\nAnd deep into injury time, substitute Sigurdsson extended the advantage with a thumping finish.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThis huge win will temper the pre-match speculation surrounding Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood's future.\nA run of three defeats in the last four league games, reports strongly linking Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal to the job and a club statement released earlier in the day helped intensify that speculation.\nBut Sherwood dismissed the hullabaloo, stating he was focused on the first of his \"six cup finals\".

So did Moussa Dembele - one from the penalty spot.\nScott Sinclair got his second goal on his first start for his new club. This was Celtic at their ruthless best.\nFor Motherwell boss Mark McGhee, the only blessing was the scoreline wasn't even uglier. Only keeper Craig Samson's excellence prevented double figures.\nThey conceded seven the last time they visited Celtic Park in May. Their survivors from that team would have had flashbacks.\nCeltic were inspired, principally, by the wonderful Sinclair and Rogic. Those two were relentless all night and rendered redundant Leigh Griffiths' absence through suspension.\nSinclair was a dervish and Rogic a classy menace. The pair of them were nightmarish handfuls for Motherwell. The Australian played in behind Dembele and the whole thing clicked from the get-go. James Forrest had his moments up there as well.\nMotherwell played five at the back, but they might have played 15 back there and it wouldn't have made much difference.\nThey were behind after 20 minutes. Sinclair had already gone close, but when Callum McGregor dinked a chip over the Motherwell defence and into Rogic, you knew what was coming next.\nRogic had time and space to take it down, turn and rifle his shot past Samson.\nCeltic kicked on from there. Sinclair sparked a counter-attack, Rogic had a shot saved by Samson, then Dembele smacked the rebound off the crossbar before Rogic followed up to force another save from Samson.\nThe Motherwell goalkeeper was outstanding but was helpless when Dembele doubled the lead from the spot after Sinclair was taken down in the box by Richard Tait.\nSamson was at it again soon after, making another double save from Sinclair and Rogic.\nSinclair should have scored early in the second half. So, too, Dembele, who curled a shot over after terrific build-up play by Rogic and Sinclair.\nThere were only occasional signs of a threat from Motherwell, quickly snuffed out by another torrent of Celtic goals.\nSinclair cut inside from the left and pinged his shot into Samson's top corner for the third, then Dembele got his second from close-range with the help of a slight deflection.\nRogic wrapped it up after Forrest drove in from the left and fired at Samson, who could only parry it into the Australian's path.\nIn the closing stages, Brendan Rodgers brought on some of his youth to add more feel-good for the home fans - 17-year-old Anthony Ralston and 19-year-old Jamie McCart entering what was long since a rout.\nCeltic boss Brendan Rodgers: \"In the first half some of our attacking game at speed was excellent and in the second half we counter-pressed very well, which allowed us to create more chances.\n\"All round from the first minute to the end it was fantastic. The level of performance at this stage of the season was very good.\n\"Scott Sinclair will make other players better.  We are very fortunate to have him. He is a Premier League player down south. He is so fast and dynamic, and gets you off your feet. He had a wonderful first game here.\"\nMotherwell boss Mark McGhee:  \"We were totally outclassed.  Celtic were flying, [Tom] Rogic and their wide players were brilliant at times, but we weren't as good as we can be.\n\"There was a lot of energy expended just chasing them and whenever we did win the ball back, we weren't able to keep it for long because we were fatigued.\n\"We have to move on quickly.

A post-mortem will be undertaken in due course. \"\nHome village mourns George Michael\nA small heart wreath and a rose are among the tributes left outside the front door of Michael's home, a detached property by the River Thames.\nMichael, who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in north London, sold more than 100 million albums throughout a career spanning almost four decades.\nHe first found fame with schoolfriend Ridgeley in duo Wham! - reaching number one in the UK singles charts on four occasions. One of the band's most enduring songs Last Christmas, is currently number 16 in the UK singles chart.\nThe song was originally released in 1984 and is the biggest selling single not to reach number one.\nIt was kept off the chart's top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas, which actually featured Michael.\nSolo albums followed, including the multi-million selling Faith in 1987.\nThe follow-up Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 outsold Faith in the UK but led to Michael losing a court case with record label Sony over his frustration at how the album has been marketed.\nHis talents as a singer, songwriter and music producer made George Michael one of the world's biggest-selling artists.\nBlessed with good looks and a fine singing voice, his stage presence made him a favourite on the live concert circuit as he matured from teen idol to long term stardom.\nBut there were times when his battle with drugs and encounters with the police made lurid headlines that threatened to eclipse his musical talents.\nRead more in George Michael's obituary\nAs a solo artist, Michael scored a further seven number one singles in the UK with songs including Careless Whisper and Fastlove, collaborated with the likes of Aretha Franklin and Elton John, and won three Brit Awards and two Grammys.\nThe Grammy organisers said Michael's \"extraordinary talent had a profound impact on countless entertainers worldwide, and his creative contributions will live on forever\".\nMichael later began facing headlines for reasons other than his music.\nAfter years of refusing to be drawn on speculation about his sexuality, Michael disclosed he was gay in 1998 after being arrested in a public toilet in Beverly Hills, California, for engaging in a lewd act.\nThe music video for the single that followed, Outside, featured a men's bathroom transformed into a disco and policemen kissing.\nIn October 2006 he pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drugs, and in 2008 was cautioned for possession of class A drugs, including crack cocaine.\nIn September 2010, Michael received an eight-week prison sentence following an incident in which he crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London. He admitted driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis.\nPop stars from Michael's heyday were joined by contemporary names in paying tribute on Twitter.\nABC's Martin Fry said: \"Absolutely devastated to hear of the loss of @GeorgeMichael Truly brilliant talent #sad #sad #sad.\"\nDuran Duran referred to the the so-called curse of 2016 - following the deaths of David Bowie, Prince and Rick Parfitt - posting on their official Twitter account: \"2016 - loss of another talented soul. All our love and sympathy to @GeorgeMichael's family.\"\nThe band included a picture of Michael with its frontman Simon Le Bon, Sting and Bob Geldof.\nMadonna posted a video from 1989 on Twitter and Instagram of herself presenting Michael with an award, and wrote: \"Another Great Artist leaves us\".\nRobbie Williams, whose first solo single was a cover of Michael's song Freedom, wrote: \"Oh God no \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I love you George \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Rest In Peace x\".\nDJ Tony Blackburn said: \"Unbelievable, George Michael has died at the age of 53. RIP. This dreadful year goes on and on. So sad, a real talent.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC, Paul Young recalled an impromptu duet with Michael at a Prince's Trust event in 1986. He said his voice \"cuts straight through your heart\".\nBoy George wrote: \"He was so loved and I hope he knew it because the sadness today is beyond words. Devastating.\n\"What a beautiful voice he had and his music will live on as a testament to his talent. I can't believe he is gone. I hope the Buddha will hold him in his arms.\"\nSee more reaction to Michael's death\nHow I featured on a George Michael song\nIn 2011, Michael postponed a series of concerts after being taken to hospital for treatment for pneumonia.\nAfter treatment in a Vienna hospital, he made a tearful appearance outside his London home and said it had been \"touch and go\" whether he lived.\nThe experience inspired the single White Light which was his last Top 40 hit in 2012 and which he performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.\nEarlier this month it was announced that producer and songwriter Naughty Boy was working with Michael on a new album.\nMichael had also recently been working on a documentary chronicling his rise to fame with Wham! and made a direct appeal on Twitter to his fans, asking them to send in their own videos and photographs dating from 1988 to 1996.\nThe documentary film entitled Freedom was originally expected to be released this year but was recently delayed until next March.\nIn 2011, George Michael joined James Corden for a Comic Relief sketch on BBC One which went on to inspire the hugely successful Carpool Karaoke segments on Corden's Late Late Show on CBS.\nThe feature is now a staple of the American chat show, with stars such as Madonna and Michelle Obama having appeared, and attracts huge online audiences.\nThe original sketch began with Corden poking fun at Michael and ended with the pair singing along to Wham!'s I'm Your Man.\nCorden said: \"I've loved George Michael for as long as I can remember.

However, they have yet to start.\nNiger's security forces are receiving training, logistics and intelligence support from both the US and France.\nMost of the border between Niger and Nigeria is naturally drawn by the Komadougou Yobe River.\nOn either side of it, people have enjoyed strong links for centuries, sharing ethnicity, culture and living off the cross-border trade.\nAt the Bosso border point, many people cross on foot through water knee-high as the river is at its lowest level in the hottest month of the year.\nIt allows motorbikes and cars to drive through easily too.\nMost cars showing Nigerian plates come from Borno State bearing the slogan \"Home of peace\".\nBut this seems a reality long gone for the north-eastern state where Boko Haram was born and has its bases.\nWho are Boko Haram?\nProfile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau\nWhy Nigeria has not defeated Boko Haram\nThe UN refugee agency says more than 50,000 people have now crossed into Niger, fleeing the relentless violence.\nHuman rights groups estimate that more 1,500 people have been killed in the north-east of Nigeria since the start of the year alone.\nIn the small Niger village of Guessere - a 45-minute drive from Diffa - we found half the population of Gashagar, a Nigerian village located only 3km (2 miles) over the river.\nAbdou Dotia says people decided it was time to leave after the Islamist militants attacked Gashagar for the fourth time, in January.\nEight people were killed and dozens of shops and cars were burnt down.\nAs he points his finger towards Nigeria, Mr Dotia explains that the border should keep them safe for now.\nOn Lake Chad, the south-eastern tip of Niger, Nigerians are also fleeing by boat.\nThe UN estimates 500 cross into Niger every week.\nThe many lake islands are now home to thousands, and a lot of people, like Mourtalla Souleymane, have made it to the trading post of Krikri on Niger's shore.\nHe arrived last month with his two wives and six children and works on the huge wooden canoes that traders use to cross between the two countries.\n\"I was going to bed when we heard the first gun shots,\" Mr Souleymane says, recalling the time they were forced to flee.\n\"When we ran to escape, a little girl was shot as she fled her burning house.\"\nHe says he counted 50 dead in the streets and recalls a group of wounded soldiers, three of whom had had their hands amputated.\nNiger has a growing refugee crisis but without camps, which the authorities are reluctant to allow, fearing they could become new targets, or worse, recruitment centres for Boko Haram.\nBut how many more people can one of the poorest countries in the world take in? Borno state has a population of five million - 10 times more than Niger's Diffa region.\nThe UN refugee agency says it will try to build new homes and expand existing neighbourhoods rather than setting up camps.\nDrought and hunger have made communities in Niger vulnerable; coups and rebellions have made the country unstable.\nThis fragile state is now threatened by an insurgency next door that is fuelled by extreme poverty and neglect, conditions which both exist here.\n\"There is no reason why it wouldn't spill over the border,\" says a Western diplomat, who declined to be named.\n\"But in Niger, at least, there isn't this dynamic where security forces drive populations into Boko Haram's arms.\"\nThe heavy-handed and often indiscriminate response of the Nigerian security forces to the Islamist insurgency has long been criticised.\nThe Diffa government politician believes that the emergency rule in place in north-eastern states of Nigeria has not changed anything over the last year.\n\"It has radicalised Boko Haram more than anything else and generated other gangs and groups of bandits,\" Mr Saouna says.\nThe young gang members we met in Diffa showed us a stash of machetes, knives, knuckle-dusters and traditional axes. They also claimed to have firearms and grenades but refused to show them.\nIn a report published this month, the Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group noted that Boko Haram has \"resorted to forced conscription and recruiting criminals and thugs, paying them for attacks\".\nBoko Haram has shown that it can hit the Nigerian state in different ways: Bombs, village raids, school attacks and child abductions.\nFor now, Nigeria's neighbours are only dealing with the consequences of this violence.\nBut the prospect of the same violence spilling over is becoming more of a question of \"not if but when\".\n\"If they tell you to set off a bomb and it succeeds, if it kills a lot of people, they will pay you a lot of money,\" one of the gang members said.\n\"We are ready for that.\"", "summary": "A member of a gang in Niger says Boko Haram Islamist militants from Nigeria regularly come across the border, looking for recruits.", "id": "27111884", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nBoko Haram is a terrorist group that has been fighting for an Islamic state in Nigeria.\nThe group has been fighting for an Islamic state in Nigeria.\nThe group has been fighting for an Islamic state in", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Nigerian government has been accused of not doing enough to stop the violence.\nThe Nigerian government has been accused of not doing enough to stop the violence\nThe Nigerian government has been accused of not doing enough to stop the violence.

We've had our grant cut from Cheshire East Council, but more importantly we've got some exciting plans to redevelop the town centre, which will go out to consultation.\n\"If we decide not to go ahead, we will give the money back again.\"\nOne parish council chairman said the threat of a referendum would be bad for democracy.\nWinchfield Parish Council in Hampshire, which has 260 homes, increased its council tax bills by \u00a367.16 for Band D properties last year, raising them from \u00a319.98 to \u00a387.13.  It was the largest rise in cash terms in England. The parish council's share is on top of a further \u00a31,408 split between Hampshire County Council, the fire and rescue authority, police and crime commissioner and Hart District Council.\nThe council said it did so in order to fund planning consultants to help it challenge Hart District Council's plan for 5,000 new homes.\nWe've basically taken everything out of the piggy bank\nChairman and Conservative councillor Andrew Renshaw said: \"Parish councils are the closest of all authorities to their community and are responsive to how their electors feel.  If they feel we should be spending this sort of money, we should have the right to do so and it would be bad for democracy to take that right away.\"\nCouncillor Ken Browse, the chairman of the National Association of Local Councils, said parishes had increased their charges to pay for services, which had been withdrawn by larger authorities.\nHe said: \"Local (parish and town) councils have been stepping up to the plate to take on a range of discretionary services which principal councils simply cannot afford to run any more - important local services and facilities such as libraries, toilets, youth work, community buildings and economic development activity.\n\"Add this to an already extensive range of visible services - like bus shelters, maintaining commons and open spaces, crime and community safety measures, running events and festivals, providing leisure and sports facilities - the average local council costs just \u00a350 a year, less than a pound a week.\"\nDCLG figures reveal out of 8,752 parish councils who had a share of council tax this year and last, 3,535 reduced or froze Band D bills.\nSome parishes are also planning further rises from April, after taking on services previously run by district or county councils.\nNewquay Town Council will put its council tax precept up 90%, adding \u00a3100 to a typical annual bill.\nFrodsham Town Council in Cheshire is increasing its precept by 50%, equivalent to about \u00a320 a year more for a Band D house.\nIts chairman, Michael Pusey, said a referendum or a cap would put it out of business.\n\"We've basically taken everything out of the piggy bank, he said.\n\"If something went wrong, like a play area got vandalised, anything like that, we would not be able to do it. We need reserves to be able to do these things.\"\nAt first glance, the largest percentage rise in parish council tax precepts is an eye-watering one at almost 1,200%.\nThistleton in Rutland, which serves a community of 46 homes, actually asked for just \u00a321.41 per Band D home, spread over the year.\nIt was a very large rise compared with the modest \u00a31.65 residents were asked for in 2014-15.\nThe increase was imposed following a request to set up a \"school bus escort\".\nThe money paid for another adult, besides the driver, to be on the bus that passes through neighbouring villages, making sure the children were safe and well-behaved on their journey to school.\nBut it was not without controversy and the rise in the precept is being reduced again from April.\nHelen Crisostomo, clerk of Thistleton Parish Council, said: \"I gather the service was well-received but the decision went through without full attendance by parishioners and it's being reversed for the next year. The increase was a lot of money for older people who live alone.\"\nAnother large percentage increase was in Clarendon Park in Wiltshire, a parish of 250 people, where a 521% rise took the bill from \u00a35.24 for a Band D home to \u00a332.53.\nHowever, parish clerk Dawn Jacobs said bills would reduce in the next financial year.\nShe said: \"We requested a precept of \u00a3600 last year which went up to \u00a33,600 this year.\n\"The reason for that was we needed to purchase new notice boards for the area and we also had a bus shelter that had been vandalised. They cost about \u00a33,000 to replace. Our request for 2016-17 will be \u00a3200.\"\nUnder the Coalition government, councils and other local authorities were stopped from increasing council tax by 2% or more without first holding a referendum, but the rules do not apply to parish councils.\nThe first such referendum took place in May 2015 and was triggered when Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins imposed a 15.8% increase in his force's share of council tax to pay for more officers.

I expect this encounter to be very competitive as well, because they are both well matched.\n\"Although some of Germany's games at this tournament have been close, they have been the better team in every game they have played.\"\nLawro's prediction: France 0-2 Germany\nBrazil v Colombia (21:00 BST)\nLawrenson: \"The pressure is off Brazil a little bit because they so nearly went out, and that should have given a lot of their fans with high expectations a bit of a reality check.\n\"I look at Colombia and think, against a tougher team and under a lot more pressure, will their top players still be as good? I am not so sure, which is why I am backing Brazil to win.\"\nLawro's prediction: Brazil 2-0 Colombia\nRead Lawro's quarter-final predictions in full\nThomas Muller? Karim Benzema? Neymar? No. Today's one to watch is Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello, or just Juan Cuadrado.\nWhile James Rodriguez is deservedly talked about as Colombia's star attraction having scored five times at the tournament, including the wonder goal against Uruguay, the displays of this Fiorentina winger have not gone unnoticed.\nThe 26-year-old has been the provider for the team, becoming the first player to reach four assists in one World Cup since Italy's Francesco Totti and Argentina's Juan Riquelme (also four) in 2006.\nHe also scored in 4-1 win against Japan, before his team overcame Uruguay 2-0 to book a clash against South American hosts Brazil.\nCuadrado predominantly plays on the right-hand side of the pitch - having hogged that wing during the opening 3-0 victory over Greece. During that match he made 11 runs or deliveries into the final third.\nIn the last-16 encounter, he was asked to cover a lot more of the midfield hence the sparse colouring on Fifa's heat map. What is clear from the statistics is that his ball retention numbers are impressive - having been dispossessed only once from seven occasions.\nPacy, tricky and a tough competitor - Brazil have been warned.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhat they say:\n\"He's a player with great physical conditioning who achieved great things with his club, just as he has done with his country, and he is ready to go to a great club, regardless of how well he does at the World Cup.\"\nColombia coach Jose Pekerman\n\"We will do everything possible to keep hold of Cuadrado. I must admit, Cuadrado's performances and visibility in the World Cup are not helping.\"\nFiorentina co-owner Andrea Della Valle\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Qui peut arr\u00eater Karim Benzema?\" is what they are asking in France.\nSo how do you stop him? Well the Germany defence will do their best, but they face a Real Madrid striker who has been rejuvenated under club coach Carlo Ancelotti and is leading the line brilliantly for France.\nHe has scored three goals so far, but could have had more, having seen one shot roll across the line (before it was nudged in), a penalty missed and a spectacular strike ruled out by a referee who blew for full time.\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps tried Benzema out on the wing against Nigeria, which did not work, until he reverted back to his centre-forward role. It it unlikely Deschamps will try that again.\nUnlike Olivier Giroud, who plays further up the pitch, Benzema likes to loiter deep to collect the ball as displayed on the Fifa heat map for the 5-2 win over Switzerland.\nHe will be France's outlet for the quick counter - and Germany might have to use Sami Khedira to \"put the block in\".\nThe 27-year-old club-mate of Benzema, is the dream hi-octane midfielder - plenty of energy, combative and useful in attack.\nHe has been used sparingly by national coach Joachim Low at this tournament, having only returned to action following injury late in the La Liga season.\nGermany looked less fragile in the middle of the pitch when he came on in the 70th minute against Algeria. Low will need his best players for the biggest occasions - Khedira fits the bill.\nThere have been 17 goals scored in the three previous World Cup meetings between France and Germany, an average 5.7 goals per game.\nGermany have reached the semi-finals of the last three World Cups. No nation has ever made the last four in four successive tournaments.\nAll 10 of France's goals during this World Cup have come from inside the box.\nGermany are unbeaten in 15 internationals (W10 D5), longer than any other side still involved at the World Cup.\nThis will be the first World Cup meeting between the two South American sides.\nThe last four games between Brazil and Colombia have ended in draws, with three of those finishing goalless.\nIn their 2012 match in New York which ended 1-1, Cuadrado opened the scoring just before half-time, with Neymar equalising in the second half.\nColombia last beat Brazil at the Copa America in 1991, losing seven and drawing five since that encounter.\nNo other World Cup tale would befit this section today as well as the France v West Germany 1982 semi-final - to be more specific, the Battiston v Schumacher incident.\nIt was one of those moments in World Cup history that provoked both shock and anger among those watching, partly because of German keeper Harald Schumacher's actions but also because Dutch referee Charles Corver did not penalise the player.\nIt happened in the second half. Substitute defender Patrick Battiston raced on to a lofted pass, poked the ball past the onrushing keeper who jumped in the air and crashed into the Frenchman.\nBattiston lay on the ground for about two minutes until he was brought off on a stretcher. The player suffered a damaged vertebrae and lost teeth in the incident.\n\"I have forgiven [him],\" he said during the 20th anniversary. \"But I don't want to speak about it in these circumstances.\n\"I do not particularly want to meet him. Over time, I realise that people have forever marked him with this. But now it's finished.\"\nIt is hot in Fortaleza - very hot.\nThe city in the north-east corner hit north of 32C for the match between Netherlands and Mexico. It should be a tad bit cooler by the time Brazil v Colombia kicks off at 17:00 local time.\nSo in a city with tropical heat, would it not be a treat to visit a park rich in fauna and flora?

Then, in the spring of 2000, stock markets collapsed.\nSome economists had long been sceptical about the promise of computers. In 1987, we didn't have the web, but spreadsheets and databases were appearing in every workplace - and having, it seemed, no impact whatsoever.\nThe leading thinker on economic growth, Robert Solow, famously quipped: \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\"\nIt's not easy to track the overall economic impact of innovation but the best measure we have is something called \"total factor productivity\".\nWhen it's growing, that means the economy is somehow squeezing more output out of inputs, such as machinery, human labour and education.\nIn the 1980s, when Robert Solow was writing, it was growing at the slowest rate for decades - slower even than during the Great Depression. Technology seemed to be booming but productivity was almost stagnant.\nEconomists called it the \"productivity paradox\".\nFor a hint about what was going on, rewind 100 years. Another remarkable new technology was proving disappointing: electricity.\nSome corporations were investing in electric dynamos and motors and installing them in the workplace. Yet the expected surge in productivity did not come.\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\nThe potential for electricity seemed clear.\nThomas Edison and Joseph Swan independently invented usable light bulbs in the late 1870s.\nIn 1881, Edison built electricity generating stations at Pearl Street in Manhattan and Holborn in London.\nWithin a year, he was selling electricity as a commodity. A year later, the first electric motors were driving manufacturing machinery.\nYet by 1900, less than 5% of mechanical drive power in American factories was coming from electric motors. The age of steam lingered.\nA steam-powered factory must have been awe-inspiring.\nThe mechanical power came from a single massive steam engine, which turned a central steel drive shaft that ran along the length of the factory. Sometimes it would run outside and into a second building.\nSubsidiary shafts, connected via belts and gears, drove hammers, punches, presses and looms. The belts could even transfer power vertically through a hole in the ceiling to a second or even third floor.\nExpensive \"belt towers\" enclosed them to prevent fires from spreading through the gaps. Everything was continually lubricated by thousands of drip oilers.\nSteam engines rarely stopped. If a single machine in the factory needed to run, the coal fires needed to be fed.\nThe cogs whirred, the shafts span and the belts churned up the grease and the dust, and there was always the risk that a worker might snag a sleeve or bootlace and be dragged into the relentless, all-embracing machine.\nSome factory owners did replace steam engines with electric motors, drawing clean and modern power from a nearby generating station.\nBut given the huge investment this involved, they were often disappointed with the savings. Until about 1910, plenty of entrepreneurs looked at the new electrical drive system and opted for good old-fashioned steam.\nWhy? Because to take advantage of electricity, factory owners had to think in a very different way. They could, of course, use an electric motor in the same way as they used steam engines. It would slot right into their old systems.\nBut electric motors could do much more. Electricity allowed power to be delivered exactly where and when it was needed.\nSmall steam engines were hopelessly inefficient but small electric motors worked just fine. So a factory could contain several smaller motors, each driving a small drive shaft.\nAs the technology developed, every workbench could have its own machine tool with its own little electric motor.\nPower wasn't transmitted through a single, massive spinning drive shaft but through wires.\nA factory powered by steam needed to be sturdy enough to carry huge steel drive shafts. One powered by electricity could be light and airy.\nSteam-powered factories had to be arranged on the logic of the driveshaft. Electricity meant you could organise factories on the logic of a production line.\nOld factories were dark and dense, packed around the shafts. New factories could spread out, with wings and windows allowing natural light and air.\nIn the old factories, the steam engine set the pace. In the new factories, workers could do so.\nFactories could be cleaner and safer - and more efficient, because machines needed to run only when they were being used.\nBut you couldn't get these results simply by ripping out the steam engine and replacing it with an electric motor. You needed to change everything: the architecture and the production process.\nAnd because workers had more autonomy and flexibility, you even had to change the way they were recruited, trained and paid.\nFactory owners hesitated, for understandable reasons.\nOf course they didn't want to scrap their existing capital. But maybe, too, they simply struggled to think through the implications of a world where everything needed to adapt to the new technology.\nIn the end, change happened. It was unavoidable.\nMains electricity became cheaper and more reliable. American workers become more expensive thanks to a series of new laws that limited immigration from a war-torn Europe.\nAverage wages soared and hiring staff became more about quality and less about quantity.\nTrained workers could use the autonomy that electricity gave them. And as more factory owners figured out how to make the most of electric motors, new ideas about manufacturing spread.\nCome the 1920s, productivity in American manufacturing soared in a way never seen before or since.\nYou would think that kind of leap forward must be explained by a new technology. But no.\nThe economic historian Paul David gives much of the credit to the fact that manufacturers had finally figured out how to use technology that was nearly 50 years old.\nWhich puts Robert Solow's quip in a new light.\nHow Diesel's engine changed the world\nBattery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars\nRise of the robots: What advances mean for workers\nHow the lift transformed the shape of our cities\nBy 2000 - about 50 years after the first computer program - productivity was picking up a bit.\nTwo economists, Eric Brynjolfsson and Lorin Hitt, published research showing that many companies had invested in computers for little or no reward while others had reaped big benefits.\nWhat explained the difference was whether the companies had been willing to reorganise to take advantage of what computers had to offer.\nThat often meant decentralising, outsourcing, streamlining supply chains and offering more choice to customers.\nYou couldn't just take your old systems and add better computers. You needed to do things differently.\nThe web is younger still. It was barely a decade old when the dotcom bubble burst.\nWhen the electric dynamo was as old as the web is now, factory owners were still attached to steam.

He was the first child and only son of George and Gillian Brookes, and he was my older brother. Andrew was nine years older than myself.\nAndrew worked at Land Rover at Longbridge, where my Dad also worked and so did most of his friends. Andrew was a lovely man, who I was very, and still am, immensely proud to have as a brother.\nHe had the patience of a saint, and I can honestly say that. Due to the nine-year age difference between myself and Andrew, he was more like a father figure to me than a brother.\nProfiles of all those who died\nHe was very strict and he didn't tolerate any nonsense off me. He was a very dignified man, and he didn't like any attention being drawn to himself.\nI remember my Mum saying, 'From the moment he got up until the moment he went to bed, he would say good morning and good night, and I hardly knew he was in the house for the rest of the day'.\nFrom as long as I can remember, he was always a Liverpool fan. I remember his bedroom being covered in posters and scarves and he had a football sticker book and collected the stickers when he was younger.\nHe was always really happy when he opened the little slip and there was a Liverpool sticker inside. Andrew was a very sporty person; he loved his football, golf, darts and snooker.\nHe was the manager of a local Sunday league football team called Bromsgrove Dynamo. He also had many trophies for his darting skills.\nI can honestly say that I have never heard a bad word said about my brother. He never gossiped about anyone or fell out with people, as he wasn't that kind of person.  He also never got into any trouble with the police during his life.\n'Wonderful brother'\nI remember my Mum saying after he died and West Midlands Police had brought some of his clothes back in a plastic bag, 'The only time Andrew ever brought the police to my door was when they brought his clothes back. I couldn't have wished for a better son. He never once brought me any worry or any trouble'.\nAndrew was a very law abiding and a very disciplined, honest, reliable and trustworthy person. He had a lot of integrity and morals, and I feel very blessed to have had such a wonderful brother.\nHe taught me a lot and he made sure that his feisty, chatty sister stayed on the straight and narrow.\nEducation was extremely important to him. He was very academic, especially when it came to mathematics and English. I remember him telling me that I had to apply myself more at school.\nI had so much respect for my brother. Andrew was 26 years old when he died at Hillsborough. He died four weeks before my 18th birthday. I felt that the Christmas of 1988 was when he was starting to take me seriously and I felt we were becoming closer.\n'Apple of Mum's eye'\nOn Christmas evening, I remember myself and Andy walking back from my aunties and I remember thinking to myself, 'He's finally taking his little sister seriously'. I can't explain how happy that made me feel. Up until then, I felt that I was always his irritating little sister.\nMy brother was the apple of my Mum's eye. He was also very close to my Dad, as they spent a lot of time together sharing their sporting passions. My Dad would go and watch Andy's football team on a Sunday morning and I would sometimes go too.\nI remember whenever there was a World Cup or a Euro competition, I would get back from school and the house would be packed with all my brother's friends. My Mum made plates of sandwiches, crisps and biscuits for all of them.\nIt became a tradition, that they always came to our house to watch the football.\nMy brother's nickname was 'Dexy', after Dexy's Midnight Runners, because they were one of his favourite bands. Other bands that he liked included the Human League and Spandau Ballet.\nHis pride and joy was his car. His first car was a yellow Ford Capri and later he got his first brand new car, red of course, Maestro.\nI also remember him shopping in Birmingham at a shop called Olympus Sports, where he would spend an absolute fortune on his clothes. He loved his Diadorra trainers, Farah trousers, La Coste T-shirts and Pringle jumpers.\nHis favourite TV programmes were 'Brookside', 'Bread' and 'Boys from the Black Stuff'. He was Liverpool mad, whether that was football or TV programmes.\n'Respect the police'\nMy brother had a brilliant sense of humour and you could always have a laugh and a joke with him. He wasn't a moody or a nasty person, and I honestly can't ever remember seeing him drunk, although he did like to have a beer.\nAndrew was brought up to respect the police and my parents always told us that if ever we were in trouble, they were always there to help us. When my brother most 14 needed their help, they literally turned their backs on him.\nI remember my brother's friends telling me after he died that the very first time my brother went for an Indian meal he asked them what the mildest curry was, and his friends decided it would be funny to tell him that a vindaloo was the mildest, which my brother proceeded to order.\nAfter the first mouthful, it became apparent that they had set him up. Instead of being angry, he took the joke as it was intended.\nOn the day of Hillsborough, Andrew went with four friends: Mark Richards, Peter Wallis and two brothers, John and Stephen Harris. Although Andrew usually drove, on this occasion, at the last minute, Stephen stepped in to give him a rest.\nAndrew was really happy on the morning of the match. I remember him coming into the house and seeing him put two GBP20 notes in his pocket and that he asked me to tape Match of the Day for him, but I said I wouldn't, as I wanted to tape something else.\nI recall that he had spilled some orange juice on the work top and I was moaning at him because I'd put my sleeve into it. He dismissed my moaning with a laugh and went off as happy as he'd come in. I was the last one of my family to see him alive.\nAfter he died, the whole dynamics of our family changed. Andrew had been so important to all of us.\n'Not knowing'\nMum and Dad never really recovered. Mum had a heart attack in 1996 and succumbed to cancer in February 2000. Dad just shut himself away, and he never went back to work.\nMy dad passed away on 4 March this year, after a five-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. I only buried my dad 10 days before these inquests began.\nIt makes me so angry that both my parents have both gone to their graves without knowing how or why their son died. No parent should ever be deprived that right, especially for 25 years.\nI do not have any other family left now and it is up to me alone to fight for my brother. I am my brother's voice, as much as it irritated him when he was alive.\nI think of all the things we would have talked about, all the family occasions we would have gone to together, and I feel cheated. He was my big brother and I miss him more and more with each passing year.\nI just want to do my brother proud and get him the justice he deserves. I didn't just lose my brother on 15 April, 1989, I lost my parents, too. The whole Brookes family died that day.\nIt has also taken my life away from me too. I don't live, I exist.

The \"yes\" vote is currently leading in all five states, and is widely supported by young voters from both major parties. Currently about 5% of Americans live in states where they can legally light up, but after November that figure could rise to 25%, signalling a possible cultural shift that could help bring an end to federal prohibition. In Arizona, the initiative has been opposed with the help of a $500,000 (\u00a3413,000) donation from a drug company that produces the synthetic opioid pain reliever fetanyl. Elsewhere, the pro-legalisation effort is being funded by the nascent legal marijuana industry, which already operates in four states.\nNevada will vote on ending the state energy monopoly held by NV Energy. Las Vegas casinos have led the effort to create a competitive electricity market, due largely to the sheer amount they use. The ballot measure would allow businesses and households to choose their own electricity supplier or even produce it themselves using solar panels or windmills. Clean energy groups (including Tesla) have backed the effort, while workers unions have opposed it, claiming that it will drive up electricity costs.\nFour states, which together contain more than 50 million Americans, will vote on significant new firearm restrictions. Polling shows that over 60% of voters in Maine approve of a law which would require background checks for all private gun sales, applying the same standard now required of licensed gun shops and dealers. Nevada will consider a similar universal background check law. In California, a proposition could create an outright ban on high-capacity magazines and require background checks for ammunition sales. And in Washington state, voters will decide if courts can authorise \"extreme risk protection orders\", temporarily banning individuals from owning guns - if a judge decides that they are a danger to themselves or others. Polling indicates that all four initiatives may pass, despite efforts by the National Rifle Association to prevent it. The attempt to change state laws marks a new strategy by gun-control advocates, after several attempts to pass national reforms failed.\nVoters reinstated the death penalty in California in 1978 by executing 13 inmates that year. Today there are nearly 750 people on the state's death row, but no executions have been held since 2006, when a federal judge placed them on hold due to concerns over the lethal injection process. One Californian judge famously said that \"the leading cause of death on death row is old age.\"\nIn less than two weeks, Californians will vote on 17 different ballot initiatives, including two that seek to change the state's death penalty laws. Prop 62 seeks to eliminate capital punishment and replace it with life in prison without the possibility of release. Prop 66 supporters want to \"mend, not end\" the death penalty, mainly by shortening the appeal process after conviction.\nSan Francisco residents are considering a ban on homeless encampments, some of which have grown to \"tent cities\" of 30-40 tent and cardboard box shelters. Prop Q was authored by Mark Farrell, a San Francisco city supervisor who told the BBC that the camps had become \"the symbol of the city's homeless problem\" and that they are \"some of the most dangerous places you can imagine\". The measure has been popular among the newly arrived tech workers of Silicon Valley, but critics say loitering is already a crime and the initiative is only intended to \"give the appearance that we are doing something\".\nWho is backing Prop Q in San Francisco?\nCalifornian voters will decide whether condoms should be required to be worn in adult movies filmed in the state. Proposition 60 would allow any California resident to sue studios that produce pornographic films where condoms are not visible to the viewer. State safety officials already require this but it is not enforced. Adult film actors and producers complain that they were not consulted on a law regarding the regulation of their own industry. They emphasise that performers can be kept safe from AIDS through frequent testing and a preventative drug regiment. Los Angeles passed a similar law in 2012 triggering many studios to halt filming in the city. More adult films are produced in California than anywhere else in the world, meaning that the state could lose millions in taxes if the law passes and studios move elsewhere.\nIn an attempt to drive down costs, Colorado residents will be asked whether the state should scrap the health insurance marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act, which is more commonly known as Obamacare. Most insurance plans would be replaced if Amendment 69 passes, instead creating a state-run universal healthcare provider called ColoradoCare which would become the sole provider for most residents.  If it passes, state payroll taxes will increase and elections would need to be held to assemble the 21-member board of trustees who would govern ColoradoCare. Opponents, led by insurance companies, have raised nearly four times the cash that supporters have. Proponents say the law will cut red tape and decrease the cost of healthcare, but opponents argue that the 21-member board will consist of \"unaccountable\" politicians who will make important healthcare and treatment decisions for individuals without their input. Polls show that 27% of Americans are so distrustful of the national healthcare system that they want it scrapped and completely replaced.\nFour states will decide in November if the minimum wage should be raised to as high as $13.50 (\u00a311.07) per hour, but only one state is debating lowering the wage rate. Two years ago, South Dakotans raised their state minimum wage to $8.55 (\u00a37.01), joining more than half of states who have raised their minimum wage above the federal minimum of $7.25 (\u00a35.94) per hour. Now South Dakota is considering reducing the minimum wage by one dollar for residents under the age of 18. The state's Democratic party is leading the opposition to the new law, which is already in effect after being passed by the Republican legislature in March 2015. Voters in the Mount Rushmore state will be given the opportunity to repeal the law with a \"no\" vote. Opponents also point out that more than a quarter of the state's residents are under 18.\nCalifornia may become the first US state to eliminate single-use shopping bags if Proposition 67 passes, although all of Hawaii's counties banned them in 2015. A 'yes' vote on Prop 67 will keep in place Senate Bill 270, which bans non-recyclable bags (except those used for food and perishable items) and enforces a 10 cent fee on any recyclable or compostable bags given to shoppers. Los Angeles, and 58 counties in California - as well as several other major US cities -  already have a ban in place.

But what then?\nAll the evidence suggests that the Russian government simply cannot afford the humiliation of a Ukrainian military victory. In other words, as in August 2008 in Georgia, Moscow would respond with greatly increased military force.\nIn the highly unlikely event that the USA then sent its own troops to help Ukraine - which has already been repeatedly ruled out - we would be in a European war between nuclear powers. If it did not, the Ukrainian army would risk the high probability of defeat, and if so, the USA and Nato would be severely humiliated.\nIn August 2008, after smashing the Georgian army, Russia briefly occupied parts of Georgia proper - beyond the borders of the separatist territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and then withdrew.\nSince neither Russia nor the separatists had any historical or ethnic claim on these strategically worthless Georgian territories, there was no reason for them to stay.\nRussian attitudes to eastern and southern Ukraine are very different. If the Russian army ever marches into Kharkov and Dnipropetrovsk, they are very likely to stay.\nUkraine can survive without Donetsk, Lugansk and the Crimea. Indeed, it could be seen as a stronger and more homogenous state without them, as the election of President Petro Poroshenko demonstrated.\nThe loss of a third of the country would be a very different matter.\nThe partition of Ukraine would indeed mark a return to the Cold War, implying vastly increased European military spending, and colossally increased aid to Ukraine intended to prepare the country for early membership of the European Union - something for which the EU is utterly unprepared.\nThe duty of Western leaders therefore is to try to make sure that the present ceasefire works.\nDespite the battle for Debaltseve, there is some chance that it may work - or at least, a better chance than that of previous attempts.\nThis is above all because it includes a critical element missing from those attempts: a political solution tied to a specific timetable, and one which allows all the main parties to the conflict to achieve their most important goal (with the possible exception of the separatist leadership in the Donbas).\nConcurrently with the withdrawal of heavy weapons, dialogue is to begin on holding local elections in the rebel territories, in accordance with the Ukrainian law on provisional autonomy for the region.\nThe Ukrainian parliament has to pass a resolution on this within 30 days of the ceasefire.\nBy the end of 2015, Ukraine is to regain full control of its borders in the east; but also by the end of 2015, a new Ukrainian federal constitution has to be adopted incorporating special autonomous status for the Donbas.\nIn the meantime, the government in Kiev will reopen economic ties with the Donbas and resume paying official salaries in the region - thereby helping in the process of reintegrating it into Ukraine.\nFor Kiev and Western governments, this agreement secures their most important goal of preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, minus Crimea, with a central government which preserves the ability to conduct desperately needed reforms.\nThis is a goal which could otherwise only be achieved through victorious war - and whatever hawks in the USA may think, any full-scale war between Ukraine and Russia will almost certainly result not in Ukrainian victory, but in a crushing Ukrainian defeat and the further dismemberment of the country.\nMoreover, trying to turn Ukraine into a country capable of planning such a war would require a degree of authoritarian nationalism which would move Ukraine not closer to the European Union, but even further away from it.\nFor Russia, this deal preserves the Donbas as a distinct autonomous area within Ukraine. A federal constitution would also help guarantee the position of Russian-speaking areas of the country against any move to forced ukrainianisation from Kiev.\nFrom Moscow's point of view, this would also make it much more difficult to move Ukraine into the West's military camp without a strong consensus behind this in Ukrainian society - a consensus which was present in central European countries during their move to join Nato, but which has never existed in Ukraine.\nThis is the main sticking point as far as hardliners in both Ukraine and the US are concerned: that the present deal will make Ukraine's membership in Nato and the EU impossible.\nIn actual fact, however, these are non-issues. By repeatedly stating that under no circumstances will Nato troops be sent to defend Ukraine, Nato seems to have rendered the idea of Ukrainian membership an unlikely prospect.\nAs for EU membership, it's unlikely any West European leader has ever considered this as more than the remotest of prospects, decades in the future and dependent on a whole series of extremely long and painful changes.\nThis is a decision therefore which would in all circumstances have to be left to a future generation.\nMoreover, given the economic reality of Ukrainian economic dependence on Russia, salvaging Ukraine's collapsing economy can only be done in co-operation with Russia, not against her.\nUnless, that is, the EU is prepared to demand from West European populations enormous sacrifices for the sake of helping Ukraine. Anyone who believes that is likely should have a brief conversation with a Greek.\nFor the ceasefire to hold and a political solution to be reached, the governments of France and Germany will have to show an unwonted degree of resolve and toughness over the next year.\nOn the one hand, they will have to make clear to Moscow that the relaxations of sanctions against Russia will only come as a result of clear and consistent pressure on the Donbas rebels to abide by the terms of the ceasefire and to pursue autonomy within Ukraine, and not independence.\nOn the other hand, they will need to make clear to the Ukrainian government and to hardliners in Washington that significant EU aid to Ukraine, and an eventual path to possible EU membership, both depend on Kiev honouring the promise of real autonomy for the Donbas.\nThe present ceasefire and the associated political process are not perfect, but they present the best chance so far of ending this conflict, preserving by far the greater part of Ukraine as a unitary state, and avoiding an escalation of the war that would most probably be very bad for Russia and the West, and absolutely disastrous for Ukraine.\nAnatol Lieven is

What made Steve Harmison decide to dust off his rarely seen slower ball? Where was England captain Michael Vaughan when Shane Warne dropped Kevin Pietersen - and quite possibly the Ashes?\nTo whet your appetite for Flintoff and Vaughan's 2005 Ashes Roadshow - as well as next month's first Test in Cardiff - here are the untold stories behind five key moments in the greatest Ashes contest of them all.\nOne essential step on the road to ending 18 years of Ashes hurt was taken more than a month before the first Test on a June afternoon in a one-day international in Bristol.\nPietersen had already shown his match-winning potential with three one-day centuries against South Africa, but it was his decimation of Australia's Ashes attack in a thrilling 50-over run chase that really forced the England Test selectors' hands.\nCombining brutal power with what Wisden called \"wristwork worthy of a squash player\", Pietersen bludgeoned an unbeaten 91 off 65 balls to see England home with 15 balls to spare and all but secure his Ashes place at Graham Thorpe's expense.\n\"I was in the dressing room getting my pads off and the lad with blue hair - Kevin Pietersen - was smashing them to all parts,\" recalls Vaughan.\n\"Generally the players would never come up to the captain and mention selection at all, but on this occasion five of the players who were going to be a part of the Ashes said: 'You've got to pick him, you've got to get him in.'\n\"I remember then going to the coach and saying that we've got to find a way to pick him, we've got to get him into that middle order to take on McGrath and Warne.\"\nDespite the positivity garnered from the drawn one-day series and the 100-run Twenty20 thrashing of Australia in Southampton, the first Test at Lord's followed an all-too-familiar plotline.\nMcGrath, so often England's nemesis, took nine wickets to inspire a 239-run Australia win.\nAnd so, when McGrath suffered a freak injury treading on a stray cricket ball during a game of touch rugby just minutes before the start of the second Test at Edgbaston, England could barely contain their excitement.\n\"Any professional sportsman will say they don't want to see a fellow professional get injured. I'm sorry but we were doing back flips when that happened,\" recalls Harmison.\n\"After what he did to us at Lord's, I thought all he had to do was turn up on the teamsheet and our batsmen would be quivering.\"\n\"We didn't want him hospitalised but we didn't want it to be something trivial either,\" jokes Flintoff. \"Personally it gave me a massive lift to think I'm not going to have to bat against him.\"\nGalvanised by their good fortune, and Australia captain Ricky Ponting's bizarre decision to bowl first even in the absence of McGrath, England cracked 407 runs in a day to lay the platform for a healthy first-innings lead in the second Test.\nBut when Warne struck back with six wickets in England's second innings, Australia were left with a highly plausible 282 to win.\nFlintoff ripped through their top order with a brilliant spell of 90mph fast bowling. But it was a delivery at about half that speed that provided one of the most memorable moments of the series.\nIn the final act of a riveting third day, Harmison bowled Michael Clarke with a looping slower ball to put England within sight of the winning post.\n\"Because I stand at slip and I watch Harmy all the time, I know which ball he's going to bowl,\" says Flintoff. \"When I saw he was going to bowl that slower ball I thought 'Harmy, what are you doing?'\nHarmison picks up: \"There was desperation in that last over to get him out because we knew if Michael Clarke was there the next day, we were behind.\n\"I had tried everything to get him out and he'd been hit in the shoulder and hit in the ribs. The slower ball was just a gut instinct.\"\nHarmison only took two wickets in the Edgbaston Test, but the second carried even greater significance as Michael Kasprowicz famously gloved behind to give England an incredible two-run victory.\nThe hosts maintained their ascendancy throughout another thrilling match at Old Trafford only for a final-day century by Ponting to help keep the series level.\nIn the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, a dominant England enforced the follow-on, but with Ponting once again looking impenetrable at the crease, they were in need of inspiration.\nStep forward Gary Pratt, a substitute fielder whose pick-up and throw from cover to run out Ponting made him the most unlikely of Ashes heroes.\nVaughan says England got \"a bit superstitious\" over their choice of 12th man.\nHe says: \"That was the only science of the summer. We always wanted Gary out there. Obviously he was a good fielder, but he'd been around the group and travelled with us, so we all just felt as one.\"\nAs he left the field, an irate Ponting fired an angry tirade at England coach Duncan Fletcher on the team balcony.\n\"All the way through the series there was this issue of what the England bowlers were doing when they kept walking off and it was clearly really infuriating Ricky Ponting,\" says BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew.\n\"When he unleashed that volley at Duncan Fletcher sitting smugly on the balcony, you just knew he had gone.\"\nEngland survived a nail-shredding finish to secure the win at Trent Bridge that left them needing just a draw at The Oval to capture the urn.\nThat scenario appeared a distant dream, however, when on the final morning of the match Australia tore through England's top order.\nOnce again, England needed a saviour, and this time it was Pietersen who delivered, albeit thanks to a huge stroke of luck.\nHaving batted frenetically to reach 15, Pietersen edged to first slip, where his then Hampshire team-mate Warne inexplicably put down the chance.\n\"There was a lovely irony to Warne's drop,\" says Agnew. \"We had heard so much about their friendship so for him to drop the catch was delicious.\"\nAs for England's captain, he wasn't even watching.\n\"I was out the back with the lady who does all the travel for the winter,\" he recalls. \"She was asking me about hotels and whether I was happy. I was like 'whatever' and then another wicket would fall and I just couldn't watch.\n\"At lunch, Kevin had been dropped and hit on the shoulder. He had a bit of a flap on. I remember him asking me - 'what do you reckon?' and I thought, 'well I'm not too sure what to say here.' After a minute or two, I said: 'Do you know what? Just smash it. If you bat for an hour and a half I reckon we'll be all right.'\"\nPietersen took Vaughan's instructions to the letter in a swashbuckling innings of 158 that has gone down in cricketing folklore.\nBy the time he was out, deep into the evening session, one of English cricket's greatest parties was already in full swing.", "summary": "England's era-defining 2005 Ashes triumph is littered with \"I remember where I was\" moments.", "id": "33257052", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n\"I was out the back with the lady who does all the travel for the winter.

I felt really helpless sometimes.\"\nThings came to a head when she took her music on the road.\n\"The first tour I went on, the guitarist slammed a door in my face. That would never happen now. If somebody treated me like that, they'd be out five minutes later.\"\nThe singer's metamorphosis from wallflower to self-professed \"bad mother\" is documented on her new album, The Altar.\n\"Do you see me now?\" she demands on Mind Games, while on Weaker Girl, she chastises a lover who can't handle \"the way I grew strong\".\n\"You have to have that mentality in order to survive,\" she says. \"Not only in this business, in life. You can't be like a feather blowing in every direction the wind takes you.\"\nOn the phone from Paris, she explains The Altar's backstory and why she keeps a replica of her severed head in a box.\nGood afternoon, Banks. How is Paris?\nI love it. I wish I could see more of it today.\nIs there a country you've fallen in love with while you've been on tour?\nI love Switzerland. I played the Montreux Jazz Festival and that was one of my favourite places.\nBut also - I don't know if this sounds funny - but when I saw more of America, I realised how different every city was. I always had this idea that Europe would be more exciting to me, which it was, but places like Boston and Seattle and Houston were just as exciting.\nThe Altar is out this week. Is it nerve-wracking to find out what fans think?\nYeah, it is. I feel different about it every 20 minutes.\nIt feels like a much more confident record. Did you feel emboldened by the success of your debut album?\nNo! I think I'm very introverted, first of all, so this business was very overwhelming. I was nervous to be around so many different people.\nI mean, I don't think anybody knows how to tell 50 people on a video set that they want to make changes, especially when they're young.  But I felt, for the first time, like people weren't giving me the respect that I deserved.\nAnd when I went into this album, I was feeling the after-effects of that frustration. I had this need to feel empowered. I needed to let go of that person who was afraid to say what she wanted.\nThe videos for this album have certainly been uncompromising. In F With Myself, you're abusing a mannequin that's been made in your likeness.\nThat was the most fun I've ever had on a video set! It represented exactly what that song means to me. I can be my own biggest bully - like, I'm chronically unsatisfied - but I've had to learn, especially over the last two years, to be my own biggest ally.\nDeciding I wanted to make a prosthetic form of myself and interact with it, it took confidence to say that out loud, even.\nIt's one of those ideas that, I assume, sounded really good on paper - but turned out to be quite bizarre in real life.\nIt was weird! You only ever see a mirror image of yourself, so it was strange to see myself in 3D. But it was kind of therapeutic - especially hitting my own face, because it made me want to be really nice to myself. It was like seeing physically what I do to myself mentally sometimes.\nWhat have you done with the head now?\nI have it still. It smells weird because we lit it on fire, so I keep it in a box. But it's still mine!\nYou should get it out at Halloween and scare some trick or treaters to death.\nOh God! That's such a good idea. My mum hated that video, because she hated  seeing me slap my face around. But that means it's good, if your mum doesn't like something.\nWhat about you? How do you feel about the songs now they're finished? Are they hard to listen to objectively?\nYeah, because it's like reading your own diary entries from the past: Nobody does that.\nWhen I'm thinking about a concept for a video, I love going on long walks and listening to the song on a loop. But I would never normally go on a walk and, just for fun, listen to a song like To The Hilt.\nTo The Hilt is especially raw, though. In the lyrics, you describe how breaking up with your muse left you \"drained creatively\". Was it hard to record?\nIt was hard to write, but I'm happy I did and I felt deeply relieved that I got it out of my system.\nThe vocal is very unguarded.\nI recorded it with  (British producer) SOHN and I did it twice all the way through, then I told him I wouldn't do it any more. So I think it's the first or second take. It was super draining.\nYou've spoken quite openly about how you suffered from depression while making this album. How did it affect your writing?\nI've struggled with depression since I was younger. It's just how I was wired - but it's not all the time. It usually hits me right before I give birth to something new.\nOn this occasion, it was letting go and becoming this new version of myself. It's like the universe's way of pulling you backwards almost, and you have to fight to move forward.\nLike emerging from a cocoon?\nThat's exactly what it is. The two years before I made this album, I felt the weight of learning to accept myself as a woman and an adult in this strange society that sometimes makes women feel less powerful than they should.\nAnd I don't just write when I'm sad, by the way. Lovesick is a song about falling in love really hard, and it's very uplifting. And This Is Not About Us is a really empowering song.\nYou're part of a wave of female artists - from Beyonce and Grimes to Tove Lo - who are unapologetic about the strength they derive from their femininity. Do you talk to other artists about that?\nI actually just emailed Feist because we have a mutual friend who thought we would get along. And I met Tove Lo at a festival in Toronto. She was standing side stage, singing all my lyrics. I just thought that was so cool, because for women to support each other and not feel competitive is so important. I already was a fan of her music and everything she stands for. It made me love her 10 times more.\nI heard you wrote the verses to Trainwreck when you were 14. Most people would cringe at their teenage poetry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIt's funny. I actually recently found this old computer of mine that I had when I was young. It had this weird app on it where I could videotape myself, and I listened back to some of the songs and I was like, \"Some of these melodies are really good.

Victor Anichebe - reborn under Moyes - has forged an impressive partnership with Defoe and the continuation of that will be crucial to Sunderland's hopes of climbing out of the relegation zone.\nAnd the club's players also appear to have developed a strong team spirit, something that was exemplified in the final few seconds of the game as they threw themselves in front of the ball in a tense scramble before Jordan Pickford superbly punched away Wes Morgan's goal-bound shot.\nThis time last year, Vardy was being congratulated on social media by Ruud van Nistelrooy for breaking the Dutchman's record of scoring in 10 consecutive Premier League games.\nFast forward to today and the striker's form has dipped dramatically - his blank against Sunderland was his 16th game for Leicester without scoring.\nVardy got into good positions against the Black Cats. He was unlucky with a clever cushioned header that landed on the roof of the net and also nodded just wide from dangerous Marc Albrighton cross. However, the England international is not getting the service he enjoyed in an electric 2015-16 campaign.\nDuring Leicester's title-winning season he linked up superbly with Riyad Mahrez, but the pair have rarely been on the same wavelength this season. Mahrez has found Vardy with just three passes in their past nine games and only once did the two combine against Sunderland.\nThere were suggestions that Ranieri was considering dropping Vardy for the Sunderland game and another match without scoring may increase the threat to his place in the side.\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"If we can win another three out of four we will be in a really good position. We are playing better and the team is getting better.\n\"We're much more of an attacking looking side now.

Over the 180 minutes Lincoln have been by far the better team, it wasn't a fluke.\nThis was a mid-table Championship side totally - and I mean totally - outplayed over two games\n\"When you lose like that then Mick McCarthy will be concerned, but the club won't have any knee-jerk reactions.\"\nThe margin of defeat could certainly have been greater but for a brilliant first-half save by Ipswich goalkeeper Dean Gerken, who stuck out a hand to somehow claw away Luke Waterfall's close-range header on the stroke of half-time.\nDanny Cowley's side put Ipswich's back line under pressure with a barrage of crosses, with burly striker Matt Rhead spurning one opening and midfielder Alex Woodyard heading a very presentable chance wide when unmarked.\nIpswich's best opening came with a low Josh Emmanuel shot just before the hour, but Imps goalkeeper Paul Farman was always behind it and made a good save.\nIpswich boss Mick McCarthy: \"I should congratulate Lincoln. They deserved to win. From my point of view the way we lost the game was ridiculous. We had a chance to score ourselves and then seconds later they scored.\n\"On the back of the performance on Saturday it was surprising how we played tonight. They controlled the game but I'm not going to stand here and give my team stick.\n\"The fans want to see these upsets. It's great for TV but not for me unfortunately. The fans made their thoughts quite clear tonight. I'm not happy about producing that kind of football in front of the fans.\"\nLincoln City's manager Danny Cowley: \"The way they've worked day in, day out, is incredible. You can have great days like this if you put so much work in like we have.\n\"I thought we competed really well and worked every minute so hard. We pressed from the front and actually thought we had great control in the game even against a Championship side like Ipswich.\n\"What a brilliant finish from Nathan. Not an easy finish when the whole of Sincil Bank is hoping he sticks it in.

So what has she done today? Is she a lawyer or a teacher?\nNo. Mary spent an hour knitting and sewing, two hours setting the table and doing the dishes and well over two hours preparing and cooking food.\nShe is not unusual, because it is 1965 and at that time, many married American women - even those with an excellent education - spent large chunks of their day catering for their families.\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\nWe know about Mary's day - and those of many others - because of time-use surveys conducted around the world. These diaries reveal precisely how different people use their time.\nFor educated women, the way time is spent in the US and other rich countries has changed radically over the past half a century.\nWomen in America now spend around 45 minutes per day in total cooking and cleaning up. That's still much more than men, who spend only 15 minutes a day doing such tasks. But it is a vast reduction from Mary's four hours.\nBehind this shift is a radical change to the way the food we eat is prepared, as seen by the introduction of the TV dinner in 1954.\nPresented in a space-age aluminium tray, and prepared so that everything would require the same cooking time, the \"frozen turkey tray TV dinner\" was developed by a bacteriologist called Betty Cronin.\nShe worked for the Swanson food processing company, keen to find ways to keep busy after the business of supplying rations to US troops had dried up.\nBut of course the TV dinner was only part of a panoply of changes, wrought by the availability of freezers, microwaves, preservatives and production lines.\nFood had been perhaps the last cottage industry: something that would overwhelmingly be produced in the home.\nBut food preparation has been industrialised - outsourced to restaurants and takeaways and to factories that prepare ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals.\nAnd the invention of the industrial meal - in all its forms - has led to a profound shift in the modern economy.\nHow we spend on food is changing.\nAmerican families spend increasingly more outside the home - on fast food, restaurant meals, sandwiches and snacks. Only a quarter of food spending was outside the home in the 1960s.\nThat has steadily risen over time and in 2015 a landmark was reached: for the first time, Americans spent more on food and drink outside the home than at grocery stores. The British passed that particular milestone more than a decade earlier.\nEven within the home, food is increasingly processed to save the chef time and effort: bagged chopped salad, pre-grated cheese, jars of pasta sauce, individual permeable tea bags, meatballs doused in sauce and chicken that comes plucked and gutted.\nEach new innovation would seem bizarre to the older generation.\nI have never plucked a chicken and perhaps my children will never chop salad. All this saves time - serious amounts of time.\nSuch innovation is a modern phenomenon.\nWhen the economist Valerie Ramey compared time-use diaries in the US between the 1920s and the 1960s, she found that surprisingly little had changed.\nWhether women were uneducated and married to farmers, or highly educated and married to urban professionals, they still spent similar amounts of time on housework across those 50 years.\nIt was only in the 1960s that this pattern began to shift.\nBut surely the innovation responsible for emancipating women was not the TV dinner, but the washing machine?\nThe idea is widely believed and is appealing. A frozen TV dinner does not really feel like progress, compared to home-cooked food.\nBut a washing machine is clean and efficient and replaces work that was always drudgery. How could it not have been revolutionary?\nWell it was, of course.\nHowever, the revolution wasn't in the lives of women, it was in how lemon fresh we all started to smell.\nAs Alison Wolf argues in her book The XX Factor, the evidence is clear that the washing machine did not save a lot of time, because before washing machines, we did not wash clothes very often. When it took all day to wash and dry a few shirts, people used replaceable collars and cuffs or dark outer layers to hide the grime.\nIn contrast, when it took two or three hours to prepare a meal, someone had to take that time. There was not an alternative. The washing machine did not save much time, and the ready meal did, because we were not willing to starve, but we were willing to stink.\nTick tock: The importance of knowing the right time\nHow a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff\nRise of the robots: What advances mean for workers\nGeeks v government: The battle to secure the internet\nThe availability of ready meals has had some regrettable side-effects.\nObesity rates rose sharply in developed countries between the 1970s and the early 21st Century, at much the same time as these culinary innovations were being developed. This is no coincidence, say health economists. The cost of calories has fallen dramatically, not just in financial terms but also in terms of time.\nConsider the humble potato. It has long been a staple of the American diet, but before World War Two potatoes were usually baked, mashed or boiled. There's a reason for that: roast potatoes need to be peeled, chopped, par-boiled and then roasted. French fries or chips must be finely chopped and then deep fried.\nOver time, however, the production of fried sliced potato chips - both French fries and crisps - was centralised. French fries can be peeled, chopped, fried and frozen in a factory and then refried in a fast-food restaurant or microwaved at home.\nBetween 1977 and 1995, American potato consumption increased by a third, almost entirely because of the rise of fried potatoes.\nEven simpler, crisps can be fried, salted, flavoured and packaged to last for many weeks on the shelf. But this convenience comes at a cost.\nIn the US, calorie intake by adults rose by about 10% between the 1970s and the 1990s. Not as a result of more calorific regular meals but because of increased snacking - usually of processed convenience food.\nPsychology - and common sense - suggest this should not be a surprise.\nExperiments by behavioural scientists show that we make very different decisions about what to eat depending on how far away the meal is. A long-planned meal is likely to be nutritious, but when we make more impulsive decisions, our snacks are more likely to be junk food than something nourishing.\nThe industrialisation of food - symbolised by the TV dinner - changed our economy in two important ways. It freed women from hours of domestic chores, removing a large obstacle to them adopting serious professional careers.\nBut by making empty calories ever more convenient to acquire, it also freed our waistlines to expand.\nThe challenge now - as with so many inventions - is to enjoy the benefit without also suffering the cost.\nTim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

The pitch definitely helped them more than us but they put a lot of grit into this game because it was life and death for them.\n\"Congratulations to the Republic of Ireland because they really wanted to go through and they were rewarded, perhaps more than they deserved, but they were rewarded nonetheless.\"\nRepublic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: \"We deserved to win it. We dominated for periods of the game and played some phenomenal stuff.\n\"It is a very special evening. To come out of the group that we were in is a great achievement.\"\nRepublic of Ireland's Robbie Brady: \"I grew up dreaming about this stage and to go and do it in front of my family is the best feeling in the world.\n\"We need to regroup and go again but I am absolutely flabbergasted by it all.

By dismissing it apparently without second thought as \u201ccrazy\u201d, he attracted a global pitchfork of people demanding that he at the very least acknowledge the potential role his empire had in Donald Trump\u2019s election win.\nThat interview, carried out by journalist David Kirkpatrick, also contained one other exchange which should give Zuckerberg some serious food for thought - \u200aand may even represent the biggest threat the network and its leader is yet to face.\nKirkpatrick first laid out the context.\nFacebook, he said, was the most influential commercial enterprise ever created, with unparalleled power that is yet to be fully understood.\nZuckerberg himself is a multi-billionaire in charge of a network that has intricate personal data on 1.8 billion people and counting.\n\u201cWhat are the checks and balances that need to exist for this new kind of entity?\u201d asked Kirkpatrick.\n\u201cDo you think about that? At the moment it seems like you are the check and balance.\u201d\nZuckerberg\u2019s answer didn\u2019t come close to addressing the question. He said it was about \u201clistening to what people want\u201d, and continuing to give people \u201cthe power to share\u201d and to make \u201cthe world more open and connected\u201d.\nBut is he confident the checks and balances are in place to stop Facebook over-stepping the mark?\n\u201cI mean\u2026 yeah,\u201d he said, peering out into the audience for support.\nEven though I was watching via a live stream, I could tell the room took an awkward turn. Kirkpatrick moved on - but the issue won\u2019t.\nThe exchange had touched upon a problem that surely deserves more attention.\nThere\u2019s an urgent accountability gap between what technology companies do and what the public is allowed to know.\nThis isn\u2019t about giving up trade secrets. You can inspect KFC\u2019s kitchen without knowing the Colonel\u2019s secret recipe.\nIt\u2019s about being able to examine the reach and influence of technology companies, where supremely powerful men, and a few women, are able to control without any genuine scrutiny other than what appears every three months on a company earnings sheet (and even that\u2019s unnecessarily cryptic).\nRevealing moments like the one Kirkpatrick summoned from the usually robotic Zuckerberg are few and far between. The depressing accepted reality in technology journalism is that if you give a company a hard time, they\u2019ll shut you out.\nAnd that\u2019s because many major technology companies guard their work with barbed wire, and wrap their executives in cotton wool.\nInteractions between big tech and the outside world are orchestrated and engineered to the nth degree. On those rare occasions, even the mildest scrutiny about anything other than the new product being flogged that day is swiftly shot down with tech\u2019s unofficial motto.\n\u201cSorry\u2026 but that\u2019s not what today is about.\u201d\nSo what, you might think. So what if technology companies want to keep their affairs to themselves - \u200ait\u2019s not a public service or anything.\nYou might also think that this is a technology journalist throwing his connected toys out of his smart pram - \u200aand for the most part you\u2019d be right, I\u2019m not ashamed to say.\nBut what Facebook\u2019s challenges over fake news reveal, I think, is that we\u2019re in completely uncharted territory.\nNever has any private company had such immediate power over the way we act, feel, think, date, buy, fight - whatever.\nAnd it\u2019s impossible, if you plan on living in the modern world, to avoid Facebook or Google.\nEven if you never create a Facebook account, your browsing habits will be logged when you visit pages that contain the Facebook \u2018like\u2019 button. Google\u2019s near-$500bn value is made up almost entirely from selling advertising, which is why they\u2019re absolutely everywhere on the internet. It\u2019s the scale that makes the money.\nHow the internal cogs of these sites work is a complete mystery. My colleague Rory Cellan-Jones\u2019 recent radio documentary into Google summarised that its algorithm was so complex that no single person could possibly grasp how it worked.\nThis situation, this imbalance, will surely not be able to last much longer. While technology bosses, Zuckerberg in particular, talk about their \u201cmission\u201d to \u201cconnect the world\u201d, we do know that under their watch unacceptable things do take place.\nThanks to whistleblowers and investigative journalists, for instance, we know that Google at one time scooped up private wi-fi data from homes as it carried out its Street View trips. We know that Facebook knowingly manipulated News Feeds in an attempt to alter users\u2019 emotions.\nYou can see how both of those examples could have seemed harmless - \u200aor at least fascinating - to the engineers involved.\nBut what they demonstrate is that what may seem a bright idea for the tech sites may be directly at odds for what is good for the users themselves.\nOne person in agreement with this is Zuckerberg, in 2009 at least. That was when Facebook was at around 200m users, and he posted a video message (in a shirt and tie!) saying how he wanted users to have a bigger say in how the site is governed.\nA special section - \u200aFB Site Governance - was set up. Check on it today and you\u2019ll see there have been no significant updates since 2012 - other than to tell people about privacy policy changes.\nSoft power\nZuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions, if he has them, are off to a very rocky start. The fake news row was a big test, and he handled it poorly - \u200adragging out the issue in the news agenda for well over a week.\nHad he been thinking like a politician, as he now must, things could have gone differently. The new reality for Zuckerberg is that it\u2019s no longer okay to be an awkward tech nerd. Instead he must deal with his users\u2019 concerns with respect, and not call them \u201ccrazy\u201d.\nThere\u2019s a lot in it for him to get things right. Zuckerberg\u2019s global ambitions will live or die on his ability to be an astute political operator. He already played a bad hand in India, where local businesses said he was harming their chances online.\nIf Facebook is to hit the potential of connecting the unconnected, Zuckerberg will need to think like a world leader and engage in soft power and openness in order to build, or restore, trust.\nAnd he must stop using \u201cincreased engagement\u201d as the key metric for Facebook\u2019s success. What\u2019s popular isn\u2019t always good, and what\u2019s good isn\u2019t always popular.\nZuckerberg\u2019s record on dealing with controversy has been pretty solid, and there\u2019s of course no suggestion he has any bad intentions with Facebook.\nBut this week has demonstrated that it\u2019s simply no longer enough for Zuckerberg to deny an issue and expect people to blindly take his word for it. Even if he is right, he\u2019ll have to learn how to prove it.\nBecause the message the public appears to have given Zuckerberg, and perhaps all of Silicon Valley, is that when you\u2019re unfathomably powerful, \u201cno comment\u201d is fast becoming not good enough.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "summary": "I\u2019ve long suspected that Mark Zuckerberg, who often refers to himself as the \u201cleader\u201d of Facebook, has dreams of high office.", "id": "38036730", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nFacebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been forced to confront the power of his company in a way he\u2019s never had to before.\nThe company\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d crisis has had the normally stoic Zuckerberg", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nFacebook\u2019s fake news problem is a big test for Mark Zuckerberg\nFacebook\u2019s fake news problem is a big test for Mark Zuckerberg\nFacebook\u2019s fake news problem is a big test for Mark Zuckerberg.\nFacebook\u2019s fake news problem is a big test for Mark Zuckerberg.\nFacebook\u2019s fake news problem is a big test for Mark Zuckerberg.\nFacebook\u2019s fake news problem is a big test", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe fake news row has been a big test for Zuckerberg, and he\u2019s failed it.\nThe fake news row has been a big test for Zuckerberg, and he\u2019s failed it.\nThe fake news row has been a big test for Zuckerberg, and he\u2019s failed it.\nThe fake news row has been a big test for Zuckerberg, and he\u2019s failed it.\nThe fake news row has been a big test for Z", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nZuckerberg\u2019s response to the fake news issue has been to call for more regulation of the media.\nHe\u2019s not the only one.\nThe media has been quick to point out that Facebook\u2019s role in the fake news issue is not as simple as it seems.\nThe media has been quick to point out that Facebook\u2019s role in the fake news issue is not as simple as it seems.\nThe media has been quick to point out that Facebook\u2019s", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe context of the above is that the US election was won by Donald Trump, who is a racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, bigot.\nThe context of the above is that the US election was won by Donald Trump, who is a racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, bigot.\nThe context of the above is that the US", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe problem for Zuckerberg is that he\u2019s not a politician, and he\u2019s not a tech person.

Here, adults with a season ticket pay between \u00a323 and \u00a331 per game and you have to feel that is value for money.\nTim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats: \"For fans for whom it can cost up to \u00a3200 to take a family to the average match in many of the leagues in British football, it is welcome that more clubs have frozen prices.\n\"More clubs have put ticket prices up than have reduced them though and it is worth bearing in mind that as you get lower down the league the percentage of clubs who put prices up has actually risen.\"\nClive Efford, shadow sports minister: \"Two or three clubs have reduced their prices, more have frozen. I commend them for that. But the basic price for fans has gone up by over 6% so the minimum price will be over \u00a330 for the first time.\n\"Fans are being ripped off. How is that fair on football fans? The only thing they put on free on replica jerseys is the name of the sponsor who is paying for advertising.\n\"You have to pay extra for the Premier League logo, the name of players, numbers, and

Dozens of unofficial versions were a hit in the Soviet Union too, proving their appeal, if not a source of income.\nBut the firm got unstuck when it tried to enter the business market. Its Sinclair QL was designed to outperform IBM's PCs, but its tape-based Microdrive storage was unreliable and the British company did not offer the kind of telephone support the corporate sector required.\n\"Their computer designs were abominable by our standards,\" Sir Clive later told the BBC.\n\"But because... IBM had such a powerful position, I don't think we could have challenged it.\"\nAfter the C5 electric vehicle also failed to catch on, a cash-strapped Sir Clive sold his firm's brand and assets in 1986 to Amstrad, another domestic computer-maker.\nAmstrad later faced troubles with computer storage of its own and eventually switched focus to TV set-top boxes before selling out to BSkyB.\nYears before Facebook was founded, let alone open to the public, a couple from Hertfordshire and one of their friends, created a social network that attracted millions of users in the UK, Australia, South Africa and beyond.\nFriends Reunited connected members with their former classmates by getting them to share the names of their old schools and the year they had left.\nOver time, the theme was expanded to cover places of work, sports teams and neighbourhoods where users had lived. Spin-off sites were also created to offer online dating, job searches, message boards and ways for users to trace their family trees.\nWhen ITV paid \u00a3175m to buy the operation in 2005, it expected to continue its red hot growth.\nBut the broadcaster made the mistake of continuing to charge users to contact each other, rather than relying on ad revenue alone, for too long.\nThat allowed Facebook, MySpace and Bebo to take the lead.\nITV sold the business for just \u00a325m in 2009. Although it limped on under other UK owners until earlier this year, it never regained its momentum.\nLast.fm began its life as an internet radio station and an associated website where users listed the tracks they liked to meet others with similar tastes.\nBut it only really took off after it merged with Audioscrobbler, a plug-in that automatically logged songs that its users had listened to on their computer and MP3 player.\nThis made it possible to build up a deeper picture of its users' habits, which in turn helped the service make song recommendations, and then later suggest nearby concerts and music videos too.\nBy 2007, the service had attracted 15 million users. However, rather than stay independent, its founders opted to sell out to the US media group CBS for $280m (\u00a3212m).\nThey acknowledged that they had struggled to find a way to be profitable in light of the royalty and copyright fees the music industry was demanding, and said that teaming up with the US broadcaster gave them greater negotiating clout.\nHowever, the service continued to rack up losses.\nA subscription-based music streaming app was a flop, and these days Last.fm is a relatively minor player. It still recommends music but relies on YouTube, Spotify and other third-party services to provide it.\nSilicon Valley might have Google, but for a time Autonomy was the UK's most highly regarded search giant.\nThe firm was founded in Cambridge in 1996 and developed software that allowed its clients to hunt through \"unstructured data\" - emails, videos, social network posts, phone calls, images and other information recorded in apps - that was not kept in neat databases.\nThe service proved popular with a wide range of organisations, which used it to carry out legal checks, create archives and focus their marketing.\nIn 2011, Autonomy proved its data-analysis techniques had further potential when it developed an augmented reality tool that allowed smartphones to superimpose graphics over real-world views.\nHollywood director JJ Abrams was among the first to use it within an app that promoted his film Super 8, and others followed.\nThe same year, Autonomy's chief executive, Mike Lynch, agreed to sell the business to HP for just over \u00a37bn. And that's where things got complicated.\nThirteen months after the takeover was completed, HP claimed Mr Lynch had misrepresented his company's financial position and wrote down most of its value.\nThe two sides are now suing each other in a case that is likely to drag on for years.\nIn a final twist, HP has agreed to sell Autonomy and some of its other operations to Micro Focus, an English software developer, meaning what is left of the business will soon be controlled again from UK shores.\nUntil very recently, ARM Holdings was the flag-waver for the UK's tech scene.\nThe computer chip designer was created in Cambridge in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers and Apple.\nThe US firm wanted a processor to power its first hand-held device, the Newton MessagePad, but later sold its stake after Steve Jobs returned and ditched the product.\nThat didn't end the relationship between the two companies though, as ARM's designs were used in processors that powered first the iPod, then the iPhone and iPad.\nMost other smartphones are also dependent on ARM's chip creations, in addition to a wide assortment of other technology including smart TVs, cars, fitness trackers, smartwatches and drones.\nMany people thought ARM might remain independent as it suited device-makers not to have the firm owned by one of their competitors.\nBut in July, Japan's Softbank agreed to pay \u00a324bn for it.\nARM's management suggested the move would help it \"move faster in creating new technologies\".\nBut its co-founder Hermann Hauser has been critical, saying that ARM could have grown \"even faster\" if it had stayed solo.\nThe UK is famed for its expertise in artificial intelligence.\nBut several of the sector's start-ups - including DeepMind, Magic Pony and VocalIQ - only became known to the wider public once they had fallen into Silicon Valley hands.\nSwiftkey was different because it actually brought popular products to market before being taken over.\nThe London-based firm made a keyboard app for Android and iOS handsets.\nThe software predicts what its users want to write - including emojis - after they have only entered a few keystrokes.\nOver time, its suggestions get more accurate as it studies their habits, and if allowed to review their social network posts, it gets better still.\nSwiftkey scored a publicity coup when its tech was adapted to help Prof Stephen Hawking type twice as fast as he could before.\nAnd in 2014, it decided to accelerate its growth further by making its app free to use, only charging consumers if they wanted to change the keyboard's design and colour.\nThe tactic worked. By the end of 2015, Swiftkey had been installed on about 300 million devices.\nBut it also caused its losses to grow.\nIn February this year, the business was sold for a reported \u00a3250m to a deep-pocketed buyer.\n\"We believe joining Microsoft is the right next stage in our journey,\" its co-founders blogged.\nMaybe.\nBut it also highlights how UK start-ups often feel pressured to sell once their early-stage funding starts to run out.", "summary": "When it comes to tech, there is no lack of ideas or talent in the UK.", "id": "37373937", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe UK is famed for its expertise in artificial intelligence.

In five of those, the Democrats have won the popular vote.\nThe \"blue wall\" is especially advantageous.\nThat is the name given to the 18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, that have voted Democrat in every presidential election since Bill Clinton's first victory in 1992.\nCalifornia (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), Hawai'i (4), Illinois (20), Maine (4), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), Michigan (16), Minnesota (10), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Pennsylvania (20), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Washington DC (3), Wisconsin (10).\nWhat makes the blue wall such a towering edifice is the size of its building blocks: some of the country's most populous states, like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey.\nTo win the Electoral College, the institution that elects the president on a state-by-state basis, the victorious candidate requires 270 votes.\nFor the past six elections, the states that make up the blue wall have yielded 242, just 28 short of the target.\nThe Republicans have a wall of their own: 13 states that have voted for the GOP's presidential candidate in the past six elections.\nBut those states amount for only 102 Electoral College votes between them.\nTo some, then, the \"Red wall\" looks more like a flimsy picket fence.\nAlabama (9), Alaska (3), Idaho (4), Kansas (6), Mississippi (6), Nebraska (5), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Texas (38), Utah (6), Wyoming (3).\nThe Blue Wall is by no means insurmountable.\nThough it held firm at the 2000 and 2004 elections, George W Bush emerged the victor.\nMany of these blue states, like New Jersey, Massachusetts and Illinois, have Republican governors, and the GOP has not given up hope of turning them red.\nPennsylvania, with its 20 Electoral College votes, is particularly high on the their target list.\nBut the wall does grant the Democrats an inbuilt advantage in the Electoral College.\nJust consider this statistic. Since 1992, the Republicans have achieved an average of 211 Electoral College votes. The Democrats' average is 327.\nDemographics also appear to favour the Democrats: the support they are now receiving from minorities, Millennials (voters under 30) and women.\nThe Democrats have opened up a huge lead among minority voters, a growing and increasingly important part of the electorate.\nAt the last presidential election, 71% of Latinos voted for Barack Obama, up from 67% in 2008. Some 73% of Asian-Americans also voted Democrat, along with 93% of African-Americans.\nYounger voters, who tend to be more liberal-minded on issues like same-sex marriage and immigration, are also leaning towards the Democrats.\nSome two-thirds of Millennials voted for Obama in 2012.\nA majority of women have also favoured the Democrats in recent presidential elections. Fifty-five per cent of women voted for Obama in 2012, while the figure for unmarried women was even higher at 67%, partly because the Republican Party has become associated with restrictions on abortion.\nObviously all is not lost for the GOP, not least because the party has demographic advantages of its own.\nIn 2012, 59% of white voters plumbed for Mitt Romney. Among the so-called silent generation, those born between 1925 and 1945, the Republicans have a lead of 47% to 43%. But America is becoming less white, and that presents problems for the Republicans.\nTheir prime strategy since the civil rights era of the 1960s, after all, has been to target white voters, regardless of their income levels.\nNext year, the GOP will be hoping that the so-called \"Obama coalition\" of minorities, Millennials and women, does not become the \"Hillary Coalition,\" if, as expected, she wins the Democratic presidential nomination.\nBlack voters will not turn out in such high numbers for Hillary, they reckon.\nThe GOP also hopes to make inroads into a Latino vote deterred from backing Republicans because of the party's tough line on immigration.\nParty strategists believe there is truth in Ronald Reagan's famous observation: \"Latinos are Republicans. They just don't know it yet.\"\nAs for the Millennials, a string of recent polls suggest that their support for the Democrats is waning - although a survey conducted in April by the Harvard Institute of Politics suggested that 55% of voters under the age of 30 would prefer the White House to remain in Democratic hands.\nThere are Democrats who believe that the Hillary coalition could be even more formidable than the Obama coalition.\nCampaigning to become America's first female president, she will hope to attract higher levels of support from white women, more than half of whom voted Republican in 2012.\nShe might attract more male white voters than Obama.\nYet Democrats run the risk of over-confidence, a mistake made by Republicans following the back-to-back victories of George W Bush.\nIn those heady days, strategists like Karl Rove spoke assuredly of an emergent permanent Republican majority, only to see Obama score two victories.\nMore recently, GOP morale has been boosted by the work of the political journalist John Judis, who predicted at the start of the century an \"emerging Democratic majority\".\nIn January, Judis penned a revisionist essay headlined \"The Emerging Republican Advantage,\" which argued that the Republican triumph at last November's congressional mid-term elections was \"the latest manifestation of a resurgent Republican coalition\".\nThe Republicans were even more dominant among white voters, he observed, which was problematic for the Democrats because they still required between 36% and 40% of the white working-class vote to win the presidential election.\nBut it is always a mistake to equate strength in congressional politics with success in presidential politics.\nOften the party with a lock on Capitol Hill has suffered a near lockout at the White House.\nBetween 1968 and 1992, for instance, the Democrats dominated the House of Representatives.\nFor that entire era, a Democrat sat in the powerful speaker's chair.\nBut during that era, the Democrats won just one presidential election, when Jimmy Carter edged out Gerald Ford in 1976.\nThe electorate that votes in congressional elections is different in size and make-up to that which turns out in presidential polls.\nHistory suggests it will be hard to win three consecutive victories.\nSince the war, the Republicans have only managed it once, when George Herbert Walker Bush followed Ronald Reagan into the White House.\nCould Hillary Clinton do what no Democrat has done for more than 65 years?", "summary": "Not since the era of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S Truman have the Democrats won three presidential victories in a row.", "id": "32632767", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

The Oregon Project will never permit doping and all Oregon Project athletes are required to comply with the Wada Code and IAAF rules.\n\"L-carnitine is a widely available, legal nutritional supplement that is not banned by Wada. Any use of L-carnitine was done so within Wada guidelines.\n\"In this case, to ensure my interpretation of Wada rules was correct, I also communicated in writing with Usada in advance of the use and administration of L-carnitine with Oregon Project athletes.\n\"I have voluntarily cooperated with Usada for years and met with them more than a year ago. The leaking of information and the litigation of false allegations in the press is disturbing, desperate and a denial of due process. I look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true.\"\nSalazar and Farah deny they have ever broken anti-doping rules.\n\"It's deeply frustrating that I'm having to make an announcement on this subject,\" said 33-year-old Farah in a statement.\n\"I am a clean athlete who has never broken the rules in regards to substances, methods or dosages and it is upsetting that some parts of the media, despite the clear facts, continue to try to associate me with allegations of drug misuse.\n\"I'm unclear as to the Sunday Times' motivation towards me but I do understand that using my name and profile makes the story more interesting. It's entirely unfair to make assertions when it is clear from their own statements that I have done nothing wrong.\n\"As I've said many times before we all should do everything we can to have a clean sport and it is entirely right that anyone who breaks the rules should be punished.\"\nIn a statement, UK Athletics said it stood by the findings of an investigation published in 2016 that found \"there was no evidence of any impropriety on the part of Mo Farah and no reason to lack confidence in his training programme\".\nThe statement said: \"Usada have not reported back to UKA on any aspect of their investigations but we remain, at all times, completely open and cooperative with them.\n\"L-carnitine is a legal and scientifically legitimate supplement that can be used by endurance athletes. To our knowledge, all doses administered and methods of administration have been fully in accordance with Wada-approved protocol and guidelines.\"\nThe Usada interim report was passed to the Sunday Times by the suspected Russian hacking group Fancy Bears.\nThe BBC has so far been unable to verify its authenticity with Usada, or establish whether any of its reported conclusions are out of date.\nIn a statement, Usada said it could \"confirm that it has prepared a report in response to a subpoena from a state medical licensing body regarding care given by a physician to athletes associated with the Nike Oregon Project\".\nIt said: \"We understand that the licensing body is still deciding its case and as we continue to investigate whether anti-doping rules were broken, no further comment will be made at this time.\n\"Importantly, all athletes, coaches and others under the jurisdiction of the World Anti-Doping Code are innocent and presumed to have complied with the rules unless and until the established anti-doping process declares otherwise. It is unfair and reckless to state, infer or imply differently.\"\nContents of the report\nAccording to the Sunday Times, the leaked report claims that Salazar:\nSalazar maintains that drug use has always fully complied with the Wada code and that athletes were administered with L-carnitine in \"exactly the way Usada directed\".\nThe Sunday Times claims the Usada report also reveals:\nThe report, apparently written in March 2016, allegedly states: \"Usada continues to investigate circumstances related to L-carnitine use\" by Farah.\nFarah told the Sunday Times two years ago that he had \"tried a legal energy drink\" containing L-carnitine but \"saw no benefit\" and did not continue with it.\nThe newspaper also claims the report says Dr John Rogers, a medic for the British athletics team, told Usada in an interview that conversations he had with Salazar at a training camp in the French Pyrenees before the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, gave him such \"concern\" that he wrote an email at the time to his medical colleagues at UK Athletics.\nIt also says Rogers told Usada that Salazar had told him about \"off-label and unconventional\" uses of the prescription medications calcitonin and thyroxine (hormones) and high doses of vitamin D and ferrous sulphate.\nThe revelations will pile more pressure on Britain's greatest ever endurance runner, who has steadfastly refused to end his association with Salazar.\nIt raises questions too for UKA, which gave the Briton the all-clear to continue working with Salazar after an inquiry was launched following the BBC Panorama programme.\nBackground\nIn June 2015, in conjunction with the US website ProPublica, the BBC's Panorama programme Catch Me If You Can made a series of allegations about the methods at NOP, and included testimony from a number of former athletes and coaches, including Kara Goucher and Steve Magness.\nThe film alleged Salazar had a fixation on the testosterone levels of his athletes, and may have doped American Olympic medallist Galen Rupp with the banned steroid version when he was 16. The programme also alleged Salazar had conducted testosterone experiments on his sons to see how much of the drug he could apply to them before it triggered positive tests.\nThe film also alleged Salazar used thyroid medicine inappropriately with his athletes, and encouraged the use of prescription medication when there was no justifiable need.\nSalazar denied the wrongdoing alleged in the programme, and issued a 12,000-word rebuttal.\nUsada took the unusual step of confirming it had launched an investigation into NOP following the BBC and ProPublica's revelations in 2015. Earlier stories by the New York Times and the Sunday Times had also raised concerns about some of Salazar's methods.\nIt is not clear why the Usada report remains unpublished.\nBBC sports editor Dan Roan\nNine months ago, amid rumours Usada had dropped an investigation into his coach, Sir Mo Farah said he felt vindicated after standing by Alberto Salazar, the man who has helped him achieve so much success. This will raise more questions over that association.\nLast year Farah distanced himself from another controversial coach - Somalian Jama Aden. And he could now face renewed pressure to do something similar with a man who we now know Usada is still looking into.\nThis could also be awkward for Salazar's employers Nike - and for UK Athletics; not least how they came to clear Salazar in 2015 - even though it now seems one of their senior medics - Dr John Rogers - says he had raised concerns to them over the coach's methods.", "summary":

They looked on course for the top six but simply failed to convert their chances and paid the price.\nThe home side were full of attacking intent from the off as Andrew Davies saw an early header well saved, and Michael Gardyne's strike brought Gary Woods into action again.\nJay McEveley then tried to bundle home, but could not get his shot off.\nIt was one-way traffic but Hamilton gained a foothold and began to frustrate.\nIt needed the talismanic Boyce to intervene and once again he did so in style. Gardyne's delivery was perfect, with the striker easing off his man and directing a header back across goal into the corner.\nThey had numerous chances to finish it, substitute Alex Schalk off target with a couple when he should have hit the target then denied late on by Woods.\nIn fairness Schalk did find the net and was incorrectly ruled offside. That would have probably settled the match.\nOn paper County look like a side that should challenge for the top six. Results like this after being on top for so long are undermining that challenge.\nChances for the visitors were few and far between, with the home side controlling the match for long periods.\nThey stuck to the task admirably but just could not get the likes of Crawford on the ball to ask questions of the home defence.\nWhen they did he took advantage, sizing up a free-kick on the edge of the box, picking his spot and finding the corner sublimely.\nIt was such an important goal as it kept his side off bottom spot. He nearly went further with a brilliant long-range effort which cleared the bar by inches as Hamilton began to threaten a winner.\nCrawford really has the talent to play at a higher level and, with no disrespect to his team-mates, better players around him would surely enhance his game.\nMartin Canning's side have a habit of pulling results out of the bag and did so once again here.\nIt could prove to be vital come the end of the season.\nRoss County manager Jim McIntyre: \"We put in a very strong performance. Unfortunately for us the quality we showed in front of goal against St Johnstone was missing today.\n\"We created enough chances to win three matches today but just didn't take them. While the score is 1-0 you always have a chance of conceding.\n\"Ali Crawford's come up with a fantastic free-kick when we're sloppy in the middle of the park, give possession away and we've been punished. It's been the sucker punch so it's hard to take.\n\"I can take the positives of the performance. The type of chances we created were gilt edged. We certainly did a lot of things well within the match. We've been flagged offside and the goal (Alex Schalk's disallowed effort) was onside.\n\"The players worked extremely hard for each other. The goal that we scored was a fabulous goal.\n\"They're down but they shouldn't be down with what they gave us. If we play that type of football, like we did last week as well, we'll start winning more games.\"\nHamilton player-manager Martin Canning: \"I've said after many games that we've deserved to win the game and today it's the opposite.\n\"Ross County were better on the day. It's a bit of progression for us.\n\"I think last season we may have lost that game. This season we've got the desire to dig in. You've got to find a way at times to stay in a game when you're not performing well and things aren't going for you.\n\"You always know when you've got guys like Ali on the park, it only takes one moment of quality and you can get back in the game.\n\"It's strange we could have been bottom. If Ali's one that flies just over the bar goes in, we could have been sixth. That's in the space of 15 minutes. It's a good point. Just now the squad is very strong.\"\n(On Crawford) \"He definitely could (play at a higher level). We definitely don't want to lose him as he's so important to us in the way we play.\n\"He's got individual quality that can change a game in a second. Thankfully today he was able to do it.\"\nMatch ends, Ross County 1, Hamilton Academical 1.\nSecond Half ends, Ross County 1, Hamilton Academical 1.\nLiam Boyce (Ross County) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nFoul by Michael Devlin (Hamilton Academical).\nMichael Devlin (Hamilton Academical) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n(Ross County) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nMichael Devlin (Hamilton Academical).\nTim Chow (Ross County).\n(Hamilton Academical) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nChristopher Routis (Ross County) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nAttempt saved.

And one private company led the way in meeting that demand.\nThat company, founded by a man called Boris Hagelin, was called Crypto AG.\nHagelin had helped supply the US Army during the War before moving his business from Sweden to Switzerland.\nCrypto AG sold its machines around the world, offering security.\nBut what customers did not know was that Hagelin himself had come to a secret agreement with the founding father of American code-breaking, William F Friedman.\nReports of a deal have circulated before.\nIn the 1980s, the historian James Bamford was researching his book The Puzzle Palace about the US National Security Agency (NSA) and came across references to the \"Boris project\" in Friedman's papers.\nThe NSA promptly had the papers locked up in a vault.\nIn 1995, journalist Scott Shane, then at the Baltimore Sun, found indications of contacts between the company and the NSA in the 1970s, but the company said claims of a deal were \"pure invention\".\nThe new revelations of a deal do not come from a whistleblower or leaked reports, but are buried within 52,000 pages of documents declassified by the NSA itself this April and investigated by the BBC.\nThe relationship was based on a deep personal friendship between Hagelin and Friedman, forged during the War.\nThe central document is a once top-secret 22-page report of a 1955 visit by Friedman to Zug in Switzerland, where Crypto AG was based.\nSome elements of the memo have been redacted - or blacked out - by the NSA.\nBut within the released material, are two versions of the same memo, as well as a draft.\nEach has different parts redacted. By placing them side by side and cross referencing with other documents, it is possible to learn many - but not all - details.\nThe different versions of the report make clear Friedman - described as special assistant to the director, NSA - went with a proposal agreed not just by US, but also British intelligence.\nFriedman offered Hagelin time to think his proposal over, but Hagelin accepted on the spot.\nFull text of redacted version\nFull text of unredacted version\nThe relationship, initially referred to as a \"gentleman's agreement\", included Hagelin keeping the NSA and GCHQ informed about the technical specifications of different machines and which countries were buying which ones.\nThe provision of technical details \"is a revelation of the first order,\" says Paul Reuvers, an engineer who runs the Crypto Museum website.\n\"That's extremely valuable. It is something you would not normally do because the integrity and secrecy of your own customer is mandatory in this business.\"\nThe key to breaking mechanical encryption machines - such as Enigma or those produced by Hagelin - is to understand in detail how they work and how they are used.\nThis knowledge can allow smart code breakers to look for weaknesses and use a combination of maths and computing to work through permutations to find a solution.\nIn one document, Hagelin hints to Friedman he is going to be able \"to supply certain customers\" with a specific machine which, Friedman notes, is of course \"easier to solve than the new models\".\nPrevious reports of the deal suggested it may have involved some kind of backdoor in the machines, which would provide the NSA with the keys.\nBut there is no evidence for this in the documents (although some parts remain redacted).\nRather, it seems the detailed knowledge of the machines and their operations may have allowed code-breakers to cut the time needed to decrypt messages from the impossible to the possible.\nThe relationship also involved not selling machines such as the CX-52, a more advanced version of the C-52 - to certain countries.\n\"The reason that CX-52 is so terrifying is because it can be customised,\" says Prof Richard Aldrich, of the University of Warwick.\n\"So it's a bit like defeating Enigma and then moving to the next country and then you've got to defeat Enigma again and again and again.\"\nSome countries - including Egypt and India - were not told of the more advanced models and so bought those easier for the US and UK to break.\nIn some cases, customers appear to have been deceived.\nOne memo indicates Crypto AG was providing different customers with encryption machines of different strengths at the behest of Nato and that \"the different brochures are distinguishable only by 'secret marks' printed thereon\".\nHistorian Stephen Budiansky says: \"There was a certain degree of deception going on of the customers who were buying [machines] and thinking they were getting something the same as what Hagelin was selling everywhere when in fact it was a watered-down version.\"\nAmong the customers of Hagelin listed are Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Pakistan, India, Jordan and others in the developing world.\nIn the summer of 1958, army officers apparently sympathetic to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew the regime in Iraq.\nHistorian David Easter, of King's College, London, says intelligence from decrypted Egyptian communications was vital in Britain being able to rapidly deploy troops to neighbouring Jordan to forestall a potential follow-up coup against a British ally.\nThe 1955 deal also appears to have involved the NSA itself writing \"brochures\", instruction manuals for the CX-52, to ensure \"proper use\".\nOne interpretation is these were written so certain countries could use the machines securely - but in others, they were set up so the number of possible permutations was small enough for the NSA to crack.\nIn the 1955 memo, Friedman told Hagelin he was well aware of the businessman's \"disinclination\" to be paid as part of the deal.\nHowever, Hagelin went on, according to the memo, to express his gratitude to the NSA for \"what we had done and were continuing to do for various member of his family\".\nThis included intervening to ensure a son-in-law had his active duty status in the US Air Force retained and a cousin of Hagelin's wife seemingly being employed at the NSA.\nCrypto AG chief executive, Giulliano Otth refused to comment on the \"intense private dialogue on various personal and professional subjects\" that had grown out of the friendship between Friedman and Hagelin in the 1950s.\nThe company now \"enjoys an excellent reputation with all its customers\", and the algorithms used in its modern products gave customers exclusive control, he told the BBC.\n\"That is why it is technically impossible for third parties to exert influence. Not even Crypto AG has access,\" he said.\nIn a statement, a GCHQ spokesman said the agency \"does not comment on its operational activities and neither confirms nor denies the accuracy of the specific inferences that have been drawn from the document you are discussing\".\n\"The documents... should be read against a background in which the UK, the US and their allies faced the likelihood of open hostilities with the Soviet bloc,\" he added.\nThe NSA also declined to comment on the specific conclusions.\nBut its associate director for policy and records, Dr David Sherman, told the BBC: \"It is not surprising to me that [the US and UK] would be very concerned about the security of the communications of those West European countries - [and] want to know what systems they might be using so that the now sensitive communications of the Nato alliance are not vulnerable to penetration by the Soviet Union.\n\"And simultaneously I think they are very concerned not to allow what we now call strong encryption - powerful encryption products and machinery - to fall into the hands of their adversaries including the Soviet Union and others.\"\nYou can listen to Document: The Crypto Agreement on BBC Radio 4 at 16:00 BST on 28 July.", "summary": "American and British intelligence used a secret relationship with the founder of a Swiss encryption company to help them spy during the Cold War, newly released documents analysed by the BBC reveal.", "id": "33676028", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe story of the German Enigma machine is well-known - a device built to provide secure communications but which British code-breakers managed to crack at Bletchley Park.

If the FA was searching for someone to restore dignity after the turbulence surrounding Allardyce's departure, he is the perfect fit.\nThe former England defender has been impressive in all aspects off the pitch since taking interim charge.\nHe has handled himself in the calm, assured manner for which he is known. He took the ruthless decision to drop captain Wayne Rooney, a player he figured alongside for England and someone he spoke glowingly about before leaving him on the sidelines in Slovenia.\nAnd he was also impressive as he sat alongside Rooney in Ljubljana after making that landmark decision the night before the game, dealing with the inevitable inquest with a mixture of sensitivity and authority.\nIn this part of the equation he secures full marks - where work still needs to be done is in the more important area of performances and results.\nThe Malta victory was job done, albeit in an attritional manner against a team intent on avoiding a thrashing, while Slovenia was more a case of 'welcome to the real world' as England struggled to find any rhythm or purpose against a team ranked 67th in the world alongside Burkina Faso.\nSouthgate - who has made it clear he wants the job full-time, after suggesting in September he was not ready - joked he was heading off for a long sleep.\nBut he will soon be looking ahead to these next two games - and the increasing likelihood that the meeting with Scotland, on the skids after a 3-0 loss in Slovakia, will be pivotal to his chances of succeeding Allardyce permanently.\nOne phrase stuck out a mile in Southgate's post-match analysis, as he said he has \"inherited a mess\".\nDid he? Should England fans actually expect no more than they have seen in two performances lacking in spark and inspiration against Malta and Slovenia?\nSouthgate is correct to suggest he was parachuted into turmoil after Allardyce's hasty departure for non-footballing misdemeanours. The whole matter hit the FA like a thunderbolt, although it deserves credit for dealing with it promptly and decisively.\nAnd no-one can seriously suggest he took over an England side in full bloom after the humiliation and shock of the exit at the hands of minnows Iceland in the last 16 of Euro 2016, a result that was a national embarrassment and prompted the instant resignation of manager Roy Hodgson.\nThe brave new era under Allardyce was hardly ushered in with a blaze of glory either as England only defeated 10-man Slovakia with a 95th-minute goal from Adam Lallana.\nThere has to be a realism about what Southgate has walked into. He is in charge of a side that was made grimly aware of its place in the world order in France - and he played no part in that.\nSouthgate did, however, have two eminently winnable matches to start with and, while four points keeps them top of Group F, the draw in Slovenia was the first qualifier of any kind England have not won in three years, halting a run of 14 successive victories.\nHe also has a squad that has talent, certainly enough to be producing better than what was on offer on Tuesday.\nSo yes, to a degree Southgate is correct to suggest he inherited a mess - but equally England have also been sorely lacking in fresh inspiration.\nSouthgate has plenty of factors in his favour - not least a shortage of alternative candidates beating a path to the FA's door.\nHe is the man in possession, the man with the chance to produce the results to make the job his. He will, though, have to produce better than has been seen so far and will need to nail down the second part of this four-game trial run against Scotland and Spain.\nThe FA will make their next move then, which again emphasises the importance of the forthcoming games for Southgate.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger would surely be high on any FA wish list but his future is, as yet, imponderable.\nHe is out of contract with the Gunners at the end of the season but a new contract is on the table at Emirates Stadium and there is no guarantee a long game of patience by the FA will be rewarded.\nSteve Bruce was interviewed in the summer but he is the new Aston Villa manager, which leaves Bournemouth's Eddie Howe as the other main contender.\nThe England job is still Southgate's to lose - but he needs at least one big result to score the win.\nEngland's old problems were in evidence again in Slovenia. Possession was conceded carelessly, almost fatally in the case of Eric Dier and fellow midfielder Jordan Henderson when they played blind backpasses to Josip Ilicic.\nToo often the back and front of the team seemed unrelated to each other, England were short of ideas and there was a grim echo of the Euros and Iceland in both halves when they were gripped by a sense of panic under pressure.\nIt was only thanks to the magnificent Joe Hart that they escaped, and there was little of the bravery that was Southgate's mantra for this latest England incarnation.\nWinger Theo Walcott, such an enigma, was disappointing once more and substituted, while striker Daniel Sturridge also went into his shell and it was no surprise when he was taken off.\nSouthgate must now seriously study how he can get the fearlessness and pace of Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford into the team and it will be intriguing to see how he answers the Rooney question when it comes around again against Scotland.\nHe has to be given time - two games is a managerial career in its infancy - and it is unfair to expect Southgate to start providing every answer in such a short space of time.\nEngland drew a game they could easily have lost. They stay undefeated and top of their group with a respectable haul of seven points from their first three games, with a remaining programme that hardly looks taxing.\nOn the pitch, goalkeeper Hart looked more like the man who was world-class for so long, not the agitated, nervous figure who made such high-profile errors against Wales and Iceland at Euro 2016.\nHart looked much calmer, moving around his team-mates near the halfway line and offering advice during a break in second-half play - and advancing out of goal to keep Jesse Lingard out of trouble in the dying seconds.\nAnd in John Stones, Southgate has a rapidly maturing central defender he can start to build England around.\nFor perspective, England are doing just as well as France and Sweden in their group and better than the Netherlands and Euro 2016 winners Portugal.

Plus, some that are beyond description.\nBetween April and June 1994, in the space of 100 days, extremist Hutus slaughtered some 800,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis but also some moderate Hutus. You can read the background to that in other stories on this site, but I wanted to mark the moment here.\nThere are times when a photograph can raise awareness of an event and perhaps act as a catalyst for action, and at other times they can seem to be little more than an intrusion into times of sorrow.  Sometimes, even when the event depicted is one of total horror, the world fails to react in a way that perhaps we'd hope it might. Of course there might be complex and diverse reasons for that.\nBut there are also pictures that do so much more, and a set of photographs unearthed in the offices of Save the Children in Kigali, Rwanda, did just that. They are not well-crafted pictures by professionals, but Polaroid snaps that do what photography does best by providing a facsimile of the real world. These pictures changed lives, and gave some hope for their future.\nFollowing the genocide in 1994, Save the Children worked to document children across the country who had been orphaned or separated from their families. The goal was to reunite children with surviving family members or to place them with families who could raise them.\nThe archive found in Rwanda in 2013 contained thousands of Polaroid photos and hand-written files and inspired a team to try to find some of these children as adults and ask them about their memories of that time.\nAfter witnessing his parents being killed in the first days of the genocide in the village of Jali, Flodouard collected his younger siblings, Cyprien and Gloriose, and fled.\nFlodouard said: \"We survived the massacres by the grace of God, because on our own we would never have been capable.\n\"This was on 11 April 1994. That is the date our parents were killed here in Nyamitanga [a small village in Jali where they lived]. When the massacres were happening, I was there but I hid myself underneath the corpses. It was as if God himself was hiding me, but I saw everything that happened.\n\"There were dead bodies on top of me, but I was able to get up and run away all the way until I reached the military barracks. There were many of us who fled to the barracks, I remember there was a heavy rain falling, we were taken in there by the soldiers, by the government soldiers. At nine in the morning, the interahamwe [Hutu militia] came there to kill us. When they came, it was at this very moment that the rebel soldiers of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front, Tutsis] arrived.\n\"We spent a week in Karuruma. After several weeks the soldiers of the RPF told us we should flee because the battles were getting more dangerous. Bombs started falling on top of us at Karuruma so we took to the road and headed towards Byumba. When we made it as far as the sugar factory, the RPF soldiers told us to rest and that they would arrange for us to be transported in vehicles. So we spent the night there. During the night, they brought vehicles and they took us to Byumba. I remember we arrived there very late at night I was with my siblings this entire time. I was with my three younger siblings. The youngest one was only two years old. But because I didn't know how to take care of a little child, she died when we arrived at Byumba. That's where she is buried.\n\"I can't say that I had any strength. It's God who did everything. At that time, when you found someone from your family who had survived\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I can't explain where that strength came from. It was just there.\n\"You see it was during such a difficult time. We had already gone four days without eating. At the time, we were hungry and we were in mourning, but when you see someone from your family, whether it's a child or an adult - the strength to take that person and flee with them just comes to you. We didn't even think about our hunger, we only thought about saving the lives of our family.\"\nAfter documenting and tracing the children's known relatives, Save the Children reunited the siblings with a paternal uncle and returned them to their home village of Jali. When Flodouard turned 18, he did a small job until he saved up enough money to establish a farm on his parents' land.\nAt this point, he gave up on the opportunity to pursue an education or professional career in order to build a house back in the village in the Rutongo district where the family are from and raise his younger siblings in a home where they could live together as a family. Flodouard is now a small farmer and the father of three children of his own.\nCyprien currently lives in Gisenyi, where he works as a mechanic in the Rwanda military.\nGloriose is currently studying crop science at the University of Rwanda's College of Agriculture, Animal Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine in Busogo. Her dream is to complete a masters degree and have a career that will allow her to take care of her older brothers and pay the school fees for her nieces and nephews.\nEvans was eight years old when he and his brother Jean-Baptiste, then 15, had to leave their village during the genocide.\nEvans said: \"When I look at this picture of myself from this time, I see a child who was suffering a lot. The child in this photo didn't know what had happened to his family. And after this photo was taken, I suffered even more when I realised that my parents were gone. Little by little, my wounds healed, but my suffering is still with me.\n\"When I saw this photo of myself I was surprised. I can't believe that Save the Children would still remember me and come to see me. I also can't believe a photograph of me as a child even exists.\n\"I've never had a photo of myself as a youth. But especially to see that Save the Children has come back to visit me all these years later - it's very moving for me.\n\"Given that I lived through such a difficult time in my life, seeing this photo reminds me of how far I have come since then. It makes me think about the path I've taken to get where I am today. There was a time in my life where I didn't know if I would live one day to the next, where I felt like I wasn't going to survive - but here I am. Seeing this photo brings back the long journey I've made from then until now.\"\nJean-Baptiste said:  \"I lost my family as a child and I had a difficult life. But now that I am a father and I am raising my own children, I understand the importance of family. A family is a child's main source of protection. I am able to provide for my children and make sure that they have enough to eat and don't have to search for food on their own. I protect my children so that they do not suffer through what I suffered, so that they never have to be the victims of violence or exploitation.\n\"When a child has a family, they have protectors who look after them, who feed them - who protect them from harm. My hope for my children is that they are able to go to school and get an education, that they live in a peaceful country, that they are able to grow up and have jobs and live happily.\n\"Myself, I lost so many things in my life. I wasn't able to finish my education because I had no family to support me. Now I am doing everything I can to make sure my children have the good things that I wasn't able to have.\"\nAnd finally, a small selection of Polaroid photographs that capture the moment of reunification between separated children and their families.", "summary": "Throughout my years at the BBC I have watched photographs arrive on the news wires from all parts of the globe, many depicting the latest conflict, natural disaster or refugee crisis.", "id": "26849311", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The archive found in Rwanda in 2013 contained thousands of Polaroid photos and hand-written files and inspired a team to try to find some of these children as adults and ask them about their memories of that", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\n\"I was only eight years old when I was separated from my family.

Only three times - against England in late 2012, South Africa in October 2014, and Australia last month - have the All Blacks tasted defeat.\nTopping the world rugby list for the past six years, they have occupied the number one spot for 10 of the 12 years since rankings were introduced in 2003.\nSo what is it like to be part of such a winning machine?  How are players integrated and nurtured? How is the culture developed and maintained? How do they deal with the scrutiny that comes with it, and maintain the burning ambition to be the best?\nAs New Zealand attempt to become the first country to win back-to-back World Cups, experienced centre Conrad Smith - who has won 78 of his 88 Tests since his debut in 2004 - explains what life is like inside a team of serial winners.\n\"It's always pretty daunting. You come in and it's 'dream come true' stuff, you're obviously nervous. But all the time I've been there, the whole culture has been about going out of our way to make the new guys feel welcome.\n\"We can't let them feel daunted for too long; we want them to express themselves - that's why they're selected. We don't want them to go into their shell; we want them to embrace it and feel like they're ready to do whatever they're asked to do, whether that's on or off the field.\n\"I think that almost without fail, after the newcomers play their first game, they're blown away by how welcoming the whole atmosphere is. I know it was like that for me.\n\"Jerry Collins [the ferocious former flanker who died in a car crash in June this year] was really good to me. 'I'll go easy on you' he said at my first training session.\n\"I said 'I've seen you on TV, mate!' Thankfully you never saw that fearsome side too often at practice. He's one of those good guys who would save it up for when it really counts, for a serious game.\n\"Every newbie that's come in, I've seen feel the same way. It's important, and has helped the team a lot. I remember when I was in their shoes, so I always go out of my way to make them feel comfortable.\n\"I know how much it means for someone like myself [Smith, 33, is one of Richie McCaw's vice-captains] just to have a chat to them, even if it's about something other than rugby, to make them relax a bit and enjoy themselves.\"\n\"It's not like we're handed a sheet with all these things that we've got to do. You're just told you're an All Black. There are high expectations.\n\"You're expected to know what's right and wrong. If you are unsure, you ask someone who's been around longer than you and they'll give you a pretty clear answer. Then you do what you think is right, what's best for the team. The good thing is the young guys want to be involved so much, that guides them and they don't want to stuff up.\n\"There's no buddy system. There are a few formalities you go over normally at the start of a campaign. The manager or the coach might say a few things. A lot of it, and what we talk about, is 'the leaders lead'.  If there's a failing, you don't look at the new guy, the new players, you look at the leadership and how they've let them down.\n\"So there's a big onus on the leaders to make sure they set the tone and lead by example, so that should be followed by the guys coming in. The idea is if they don't follow, they'll wean themselves out.\"\n\"The public expectation is tough to deal with sometimes. It's a bit of a challenge but I think you just embrace it, you realise it's a good thing, if you use it in the right way.\n\"It's awesome having that support when things go well. That's why we want to be All Blacks, we've all dreamed of doing it, because everyone loves the team.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Then it's a matter of making sure you have a balance, you don't get carried away with it and don't think it's daunting and hindering your personal life. That can take a bit of experience.\n\"I think older guys are good at making younger guys understand it. If they see a guy who gets too wound up or caught up in the whole bubble, they're pretty quick to let them know they've got to do things a bit different.\n\"You learn early on that you need a way to take your mind off the game and to distance yourself from the pressure and scrutiny. If you don't have that, it's going to be a tough old life. You don't really survive in the All Blacks if you don't learn it quick.\n\"You've got to be able to relax and realise that it is just a game. The guys with kids will go away and spend time with their families and realise that is what's important in life. Everyone has their own ways of doing it, and the All Blacks have got it figured out more than most.\"\n\"For someone like me who's been around a while, you've got to come up with different ways of playing the game.\n\"You have to keep observing the way it's being played, and how younger guys or other players are doing things in your position, or the way the game's going. At a high level in elite sport, you can never stand still or you get overtaken.\n\"As a team, we talk about that. We know also as individuals, if you keep doing the same thing season after season, the opposition will figure you out. You won't have continued success and you won't keep performing at a high level.\n\"I'm sure it's not easy for the All Blacks coaches to talk to Richie McCaw and tell him he should be doing something a different way, or asking the question of whether what he's doing is the right thing.\n\"But that's what you do. All the time I've had, the coaching team have been good at encouraging but also challenging players, challenging the team - what we're doing and why we're doing it. It's a massive part of it.\"\n\"You look at that history and the challenge is to lay it down to each player; every year the team that's selected has to add their bit to the legacy.\n\"That's pretty important - you're not daunted by that history, you actually embrace it, you want to add something to it.\n\"There's more to win, there's streaks to extend, there's teams that you don't want to be the first to lose to. There's always more to achieve and that thirst for more is massive within the team. You don't just want to make the team, you want to add your bit to it.\n\"No-one's ever won the World Cup back to back, so that's pretty motivating for everyone, but particularly the group we've got.\n\"When we talk about an All Blacks legacy, there are a lot of things we've done before, but every now and then you find something that even an All Blacks team hasn't done.\n\"We haven't had good success overseas with World Cups, particularly in the northern hemisphere. So winning two World Cups, or a World Cup away from home - those are massive motivators.\n\"We don't have to talk about it a lot, that's the beauty of the team. It doesn't take much discussion, because everyone's aware of it. It's something that burns pretty deep for all the players.\"\nAlexander Bisley is a Kiwi journalist covering the Rugby World Cup.

It was found by a member of the public and handed to police.\nAt the time he was sacked, Acott was suffering from panic attacks - and he has since been diagnosed as suffering from Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, brought on by the pressure of his career in the service.\nAcott claims MI5 took an opportunity to get rid of him. \"MI5 was my life,\" he says. \"I would have done - within reason - anything for them.\"\nThough former director-generals of MI5 such as Dame Stella Rimington and Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller have written about their time in the secret service, Acott's is the first account of life as a 'foot-soldier' in the dangerous and secretive world of counter-espionage.\nAcott told Newsnight he was immensely proud to have been an MI5 surveillance officer - he was recruited from the Royal Navy by a senior officer.\nHe says he put himself in numerous dangerous situations because he believed in the work he was doing.\nBut he admitted the pressure began to get to him after 9/11 when MI5 found itself completely unprepared for the Islamic terrorist threat. There was only one Muslim surveillance officer he was aware of in the whole of the surveillance unit.\n\"(MI5) was totally understaffed. We weren't used to dealing with the way they acted. The good thing about following Irish targets is the Active Service Units would generally meet in pubs you could go into.\n\"The Islamists would meet round each other's houses or in mosques which you can't get away with going into. Also, they were living in mostly ethnic areas and often you would find the only white people on the street were surveillance officers.\"\nMI5 was blindsided by the July 7 attacks in 2005 and was stretched to breaking point when it helped foil the plot to detonate explosives on transatlantic airliners a year later.\n\"It was horrendous. We had around eight targets mostly based in Walthamstow, a couple in High Wycombe. It was 24 hours a day. It went on for quite some time,\" says Acott.\n\"With all of Special Branch, with all of MI5, there was just not enough people. CID became involved, British Transport police became involved. That's how desperate we'd become.\n\"If that airline job had gone as planned it would have eclipsed 9/11. It would have been horrendous.\"\nThe full report with former MI5 agent Robert Acott is on Newsnight, on BBC Two at 10:30pm on Wednesday 15 July\nWatch on BBC iPlayer\nAcott was in a team following the ringleader of the group, whose codename was Lion Roar. \"He was the leader, he was the boss. He was in two minds about whether to martyr his wife and child as well as himself. Just before he was arrested, he took his wife and child with him to Mothercare. It seemed unbelievable to me that he could do that at the same time as he was thinking of killing so many people.\"\n\"They were making martyrdom videos. We had cameras hidden in the flat so we could see them videoing themselves.\"\nAcott said following new suspects on the London underground became particularly stressful.\n\"The jobs I was really unhappy with was what they would call 'the first look up'.  If they were a terrorist you had no idea at what stage they were at. I became particularly nervous of travelling on tubes with them.\"\n\"On one occasion this chap had shaved his head, which is a ritual they they go through. He was on the tube and was stood by the doors in the middle. I was at the end of the tube keeping an eye on him. I had been separated from my team.\n\"My body comms didn't work very well underground. I was on my own. I looked around. People were on phones, doing crosswords, a woman with a toddler trying to keep it under control. I started having a panic attack.\"\nAcott says he travelled all over the world for MI5, following suspects out of the UK to Europe and the Middle East on a passport with a false identity.\nHe also went to Ireland to provide covert help to MI5 handlers who had meetings with IRA double agents.\nAcott said the trips were undeclared to the Irish government and the surveillance teams would have been stranded had they been caught by republicans - or the Garda.\nThe surveillance on the suspected paedophile - codenamed Operation Saturday - caused him concern, he says, because he couldn't understand why MI5 was doing it.\n\"It involved extremely powerful, wealthy people. It was a very need to know job... We were given the scantest of briefings on it. All of a sudden the job stopped. I did actually question why were we doing paedophiles - it wasn't in our remit.\n\"The trouble with the police is they move from job to job. Special Branch only do it for three or four years. Then they go onto CID or some other job. There was a strong suspicion of corruption within the police, whereas MI5 was more highly trusted.\"\nThe operation ended after a few weeks - Acott says the target was using drugs and prostitutes, but he saw no signs of child abuse.\nAcott says his health began to deteriorate in 2006. He began to have nightmares and panic attacks and he was drinking to help cope with the pressure.\n\"I know I was in a mess at the time. But the service didn't want to deal with that. Once they realised I had health problems, I think they just wanted rid of me.\n\"They went through the motions. I was definitely being bullied by my team leader and my junior team leader... They sent me to see a doctor. However the doctor wasn't there to help me as far as I could see. He was there to diagnose me as an alcoholic.\"\nAcott was dismissed for gross misconduct over the file he had left in his garden shed. He told an MI5 tribunal the document was so dull he didn't believe it had any security status, but he was sacked.\nThe dismissal, he says, accelerated his health problems - he tried to commit suicide on at least three occasions. His parents, who have also spoken to the BBC, said they were convinced their son was suffering from PTSD, but a psychologist used by the service disagreed.\nIn a letter to his parents, MI5 said: \"It is important to reiterate that this Department is not responsible for his health problems, nor do his problems stem from his time working here.\"\nHowever, four doctors have now diagnosed him as suffering from PTSD - including clinicians from the military veterans' charity, Combat Stress.\nAcott recently attended one of the charity's residential courses.\nHe told Newsnight he wants MI5 to admit it made a mistake when he was sacked. He also believes he is entitled to a medical pension.\nSecurity sources insisted that MI5 has professional teams that support the physical and mental wellbeing of staff because of \"the very particular nature of the work\".\nSources said staff do come forward and that support teams are proactive \"during difficult periods such as at a time of particular operational intensity or following the death of a colleague\".\nThe full report with former MI5 agent Robert Acott is on Newsnight, on BBC Two at 10:30pm on Wednesday 15 July.

Nor was he speaking on behalf of the IMF.\nHe was invited to explain how taxation and spending works in federal countries, having recently co-authored a study of 13 nation states where 'sub-national regions' have extensive powers - as with the American, Australian and Indian states, Canadian provinces and German lander.\nThey looked also at Austria and Spain, which aren't quite federal systems, but have elements of sharing taxation and government spending from which it's worth learning.\nAnd while this academic tome was directed towards informing the hugely complex question of how the eurozone can co-ordinate its governments' finances better, it's not hard to see the implications for future fiscal relations between Holyrood and Westminster, if the Smith Commission is to be enacted.\nOr rather, a close reading of it might indicate that there are bits of the Smith Commission that might be better not enacted, or at least re-thought, at a more careful pace.\nThe book, Designing a European Fiscal Union, published by Routledge, \u00c2\u00a388, takes some digesting.\nFor a more readable (and cheaper) guide to devolved tax, the Scottish Parliament's research service, SPICE, is worth a look.\nIt helps to put the changing position of Scotland's tax autonomy into some international perspective.\nThe conclusion of the IMF study is that there is no one way to skin the federal cat.\nThe share of tax raised by 'sub-national' regions ranges from 31% in Austria to 67% in Canada. Germany is at 39%; the USA at 60%.\nBut if you take out shared taxes, over which the sub-national region has limited control, the picture is different. Only Canada, the US and Switzerland are above a third.  In Austria, Germany and Mexico, it's under 10%.\nThe study calculates a transfer dependency, a measure of how much sharing and pooling of resources goes on within each country, and that also ranges widely.\nIt accounts for 88% of regional spend in Mexico, 16% in Canada, and 18% in the US. Among countries more similar to the UK, figures include Austria 45%, Belgium 64%, Germany 54% and Spain 50%.\nThe IMF economists show that systems are, of course, shaped by the history of how countries were drawn together.\nThey can be changed - as is the case with the eurozone - by the often bruising experience of shocks for which their rules were not prepared.\nAnd they depend on one commodity that is not immediately evident from the current state of Holyrood-Westminster relations: a mutual desire for co-operation and stability. That is, you can get systems that work, but all sides have to buy into them and must want to make them work.\nWhat these arrangements require are fiscal rules, recognised by both sides. The obvious ones are around the scale of deficits and debts.\nAnd if two governments have a different approach to taxing, spending and cutting their way out of recession - as between the Westminster coalition and the Scottish government in recent years - then there's an obvious problem.\nFor those who break the rules, there have to be meaningful sanctions. And as the eurozone has found (it didn't take a genius to see this problem coming), countries that run rule-breaking deficits are not well placed to pay big fines as a penalty for doing so - not without borrowing more and running a bigger deficit.\nAchieving flexibility and consistency is a tricky balancing act. Co-ordinating across the economic cycle, and applying that famous economic stabiliser, requires thinking in advance of the point when the downturn hits home.\nThere's a long history of ad hoc arrangements being put in place when there are such crises. Together, they offer some worthwhile lessons for those trying to plan ahead for a robust system.\nAnd there's borrowing: when should it be allowed, to what extent, by what means, who carries the risk, how much should a central government signal its willingness or unwillingness to leave its smaller partner hanging out to dry in the bond markets?\nA crucial part of any federal system is the extent to which it shares risks and transfers money from the rich to the poor, from the buoyant to those fallen on relatively harder times.\nAll of these issues require inter-government bodies to negotiate the share-out of powers, inter-government grants, the application of rules and borrowing quotas. Both or all sides have to be politically committed to these bodies.\nWe're yet to see the machinery that the UK Treasury sets up which gives devolved administrations some parity of esteem in such negotiations, as the IMF indicate you ought to be able to find in Belgium, Mexico, Argentina and the USA.\nThat will, or would, be a big challenge to the culture and the sovereign will of Treasury ministers and mandarins. The Barnett Formula has, for 36 years, been a way of avoiding such discussions.\nThe IMF survey found that the answer is typically through income tax. And that is a bit of a problem, because income tax is the main pillar on which the Smith Commission built its further devolution of powers to Holyrood.\nIf the Scottish Parliament is to depend on buoyant income tax take, it is going to have to have very much sounder data on which to base its forecasting.\nAnd that income tax departure from the federalised norm is a reminder that the Smith Commission seems to be based on very little assessment of what doesn't work elsewhere, before committing to what it thinks will work.\nThis may become clearer today as we get the draft clauses of the legislation being built on the Smith Commission foundations.\nOne aspect of those plans that grabbed the attention of academics discussing the IMF study with Sr Cottarelli is something called the 'no detriment' principle. It's significant because the expert in these federal systems knew of no other country which has it.\nIt's in the Smith Commission report, page nine, section seven, subsection five, and it goes like this: \"The package of powers agreed through the Smith Commission process, when taken together, should not cause detriment to the UK as a whole nor to any of its constituent parts\".\nIt goes on to say the further devolution should cause \"neither the UK Government nor the Scottish Government to gain or lose financially simply as a consequence of devolving a specific power\".\nI'm hazarding a guess that you'll probably hear more about this, because if it's interpreted literally, it means that the use of any tax power which gets an advantage over another part of the UK requires compensation to the disadvantaged side.\nWhatever one side gains, to the disadvantage of the other, it has to refund.\nThat looks fiendishly difficult to calculate in a way that either side of such negotiations could agree upon, as the impact could be felt over many years.\nAnd whether it's designed to look this way or not, the implication is that a lot of policy divergence would be rendered pointless. And if you can't diverge policy to make a difference, why bother having the power?\nIndeed, this problem is already being seen in the assumptions being made about the devolution of stamp duty to Holyrood, and the impact that has on the Scottish block grant.\nWe've seen problems and anomalies arise around this sort of thing before - for instance, when the funding of English students diverged from Scotland's, when water boards were privatised but not in Scotland, and when free personal care in Scotland didn't align with the UK-wide attendance allowance.\nTo return to the debate before 18 September 2014, would independence avoid such difficult circumstances? Possibly. But remember the need for negotiations to share the pound sterling as the continuing currency for Scotland?\nA lot of the challenges facing federal systems would crop up in these talks too.

Three of those who died have been identified.\nThere was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said.\nThe town hall protest began at around 15:00 BST and scores have since joined it.\nAt around 16:30 BST, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building.\nOne member of the public said people made homeless by the fire needed help \"right now\", adding: \"Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street\".\nThe organisers of the protest said council leaders would not come out to talk to them, but had released a statement, promising to rehouse as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected.\nHowever, they refused to give out the number of people who lived in the tower block - which was one of the protesters' demands, organisers said.\nMustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, said the council's response was \"flimsy\" with \"no concrete answers\".\n\"The people were not satisfied with the answers,\" he told BBC News. \"The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking.\"\nPolice then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to \"physical confrontation\" between the two sides.\n\"We would like the chief executive of the council to make public commitments on what the council is going to do for the victims of this borough, and for all the other buildings in the borough that [could] stand the same fate at Grenfell Towers.\"\nThe Queen and Duke of Cambridge met volunteers, residents and community representatives during their visit to the Westway Sports Centre.\nThe Queen paid tribute to the \"bravery\" of firefighters and the \"incredible generosity\" of volunteers now offering support.\nMetropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said that of those who were killed, one died in hospital.\nHe also said there was nothing to suggest that the fire was started deliberately, and that everyone in hospital has now been identified. Police say some of those killed in the fire may never be identified.\nThe fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday.\nIt tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control.\nMahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: \"At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived.\"\nEmergency services are spending a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington.\nFire chiefs say they do not expect to find more survivors.  Police have launched a criminal investigation into the fire and PM Theresa May has ordered a public inquiry.\nThe prime minister faced criticism for not meeting survivors on a visit to the scene on Thursday, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.\nWhen Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom visited the scene, a man shouted: \"Why are Sadiq Khan and Corbyn coming down here to speak to people and Theresa May is coming here with police, walking around, not meeting no-one, not meeting families?\n\"Enough is enough, I have got friends in that tower. We have a right to be angry.\"\nDowning Street said the purpose of her visit was to get a briefing from emergency services and she later announced a public inquiry.\nBut former cabinet minister Michael Portillo said the prime minister \"didn't use her humanity\".\nSo far in the investigation:\nThe leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council told BBC Two's Newsnight it would not use the type of cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower on other buildings in the borough.\nThe cladding - installed on the tower in a recent renovation - has come under scrutiny, with experts saying a more fire resistant type could have been used.\nOn Thursday, the first victim of the fire was named as Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, 23.\nThe Syria Solidarity Campaign said Mr Alhajali, a civil engineering student, had been in a flat on the 14th floor when the fire broke out, and had spent two hours on the phone to a friend in Syria.\nHe had been trying to get through to his family while he was waiting to be rescued.\nHis older brother, Omar, told the BBC he had lost Mohammed on the way out of the building.\nTwo other victims have also been named.\nFive-year-old Isaac Shawo reportedly got separated from his family in the smoke and later died.\nArtist and photographer Khadija Saye, 24, lived on the 20th floor and also died.\nBy Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent\nThis is the British monarchy, in action, showing it has learnt from its mistakes of the past.\nMistakes that have included the significant time that elapsed before the Queen visited the site of the Aberfan disaster in the 1960s and the \"Show us you care\" newspaper headlines that were printed 20 years ago, in the days following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\nAs Theresa May is learning to her cost, it is a tragedy with a growing political dimension.

You're not alone. In fact a massive 70% of US workers are \"not engaged\" or are \"actively disengaged\" at work. Workers elsewhere appear to agree.\nSo what can we do about it?\nDave Coplin has a few ideas.\nHe is Microsoft UK's chief envisioner. But he's also something of an influential expert when it comes to how we work.\nIt's something he's passionate about, and that comes across clearly in his new book Business Reimagined: Why work isn't working and what you can do about it.\n\"Fundamentally I think work isn't working,\" he says.\n\"We ended up in containers that are no longer relevant, we still think about work as a destination when we should think about it is as an activity.\n\"It's something that we do, it's not a place we go - I can work from anywhere.\"\nHe sees technology as part of the problem. Rather than creating a world where the ability to work anywhere frees us up to enjoy life a little more, he sees the opposite happening.\n\"I grew up on Star Trek and comic books, and had this belief that technology is a force that is supposed to bring positive things to society.\n\"Then I look around at what we're doing and I see how technology has become a cage to lots of people.\"\nHe cites email as a particular example of an out-dated use of technology - using email for everything, rather than pick up the phone, say, or using other collaborative applications. This, he says, stifles both productivity and creativity.\nAs well as spending hours in the office dealing with it, we've become trapped by the need check our email weekends, evenings, at the school play, at the supermarket, wherever we are.\nThis is partly self-inflicted and partly down to corporate culture and a basic misunderstanding of how these tools should be used says Mr Coplin.\n\"We allow technology to overtake us, and this way we become slaves to it, so all of these things conspire.\n\"I know there is more to technology, I know what it can do, I see this stuff we do, the stuff that our competitors do, the potential technology offers a modern society whether it's just work or play.\n\"It's huge and the challenge is, unless we open our eyes to use that we're never going to get that.\"\nPart of the change Mr Coplin is advocating involves the physical spaces where we do our jobs.\nThe office was originally the place work had to be done.\nThen it was the only place that had the technology necessary to do your job. Now, most of us have better devices at home.\n\"One of the basic premises of our theory is that the future belongs to creativity. So if we are going to be more competitive as businesses, we are going to do more things differently,\" he says.\n\"If you buy that theory open plan offices are terrible.\"\nThe argument is that the large open spaces so beloved of modern architects and HR departments end up destroying the very things they were supposed to nurture and encourage.\nTechnologist and writer Ben Hammersley wrote the introduction to the book.\nHe likens them to the African savannah - herds of antelopes - or staff - in groups, while at the edge sit the hunters, the managers, with their screens shielded, ready to pounce on the weak or visibly unproductive.\nRecent research says these offices make us sick, less productive and unhappy.\nTo do our best work, we need to get into something called a 'flow state' - it takes the average human 15 minutes to get there.\n\"When was the last time you had 15 minutes where you weren't distracted by a phone call, email or someone telling you about last night's Eastenders?\" says Mr Coplin.\nThe answer, says Mr Coplin, is to embrace a flatter hierarchy while giving your staff freedom to work flexibly.\nBut this doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does.\n\"When I talk to people about flexible working, what they will typically say, oh you mean working from home?\" he says.\n\"Well, sort of.  Actually what I really mean is being mindful of the location that you are going to be able to do the work you have do today. And being really thoughtful about what that is.\"\nThe other problem is that working flexibly is often seen as a perk for individuals or people with children - and causes trust issues.\nBut Mr Coplin's research turned up something interesting.\n\"The [trust] issue is not between the employer and employee like we thought it would be, it is actually between employees.\"\nThe fear of earning your colleague's disdain results in sometimes paranoid behaviour.\n\"I start to do stupid things. I start to send more emails, I get up early, send a really early email, and then all of a sudden, I am not using the tools effectively,\" he explains.\n\"I am doing this because I am worrying about what they are going to be saying.\"\n\"You [have to] make it an organisational objective, you say that actually, yes, it is important for individuals but we believe that every single member of the workforce should have the capability to work flexibly.\"\nAlthough Mr Coplin points out that certain jobs and professions obviously do require bodies on site.\nAll of this of course hinges on the right technology. And that means using the right tools in the right way, according to Mr Coplin, building his definition of the social enterprise. Simply running a Twitter feed doesn't count.\n\"We're locked into this really bizarre world where we have a richer technology experience at home than most people have at work. We now communicate really differently at home and in our personal lives than we communicate at work.\"\n\"You see the power of what you can do socially, but you see the constraints on how you share and collaborate at work.\n\"It's going to start to merge, because I think [people have] a higher expectation of how to collaborate.\"\nThis is a democratisation of knowledge and participation that Mr Coplin says could help employees feel more invested in their employer.\nHe describes the 'Ask Me' group used by IT company Merlin, where staff post questions and get answers from people across the company and around the world - shortcutting the route to the right person with the right knowledge.\nDespite all this, the majority of organisations that have tried to implement social collaboration have failed.\nIf this is so beneficial to business, how can this be?\nAccording to Mr Coplin, companies can't be half-hearted - these policies and technologies have to be integrating into the fabric of what people do, rather than used in barely-supported pockets, or in isolation, where they languish and die. As with flexible working, it should be for everyone, not a 'special' few.\n\"We talk about flexible working, social collaboration, managing people differently, to me it's like a conveyor belt of topics,\" he says.\n\"You don't do those three things and then voila, you have re-imagined your business. That's just the beginning of how you start.\n\"The most important thing is you've got to think differently about both the world that you live in, and the opportunities that lie in front of you as a business, and how you could think differently.\"\nAs he talks you get a sense of just how passionate he is about this.\n\"It's a philosophy, it's a different state of mind about the potential of work,\" states Mr Coplin.\n\"I am really lucky, because I sit in this incredible vantage point called Microsoft, and I can see right across different sectors, different sizes of customers, see how all this stuff comes into play.\nYou can see the potential that exists ... we've got to change.\"", "summary": "Are you happy at work?", "id": "23260286", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

In New York City, she took 79% of the vote.\nOf the city's five boroughs, Trump took Staten Island, a blue-collar stronghold, but was beaten badly in the other four. In Manhattan, his long-time home, nine out of 10 voters supported Hillary Clinton.\nNew Yorkers have voiced their displeasure with a Big Apple mix of in-your-face boisterousness and creative flair.\nNot only have there been large and vocal demonstrations, but also more subtle forms of dissent, like the Post-it protest at Union Square subway station, where an entire underpass has become a multi-coloured collage of mainly anti-Trump invective.\nLast week, residents at apartment buildings on the Upper West Side adorned with the Trump brand successfully agitated to have those five offending capital letters removed.\nSince his unexpected win, Manhattan has taken on the feel of a real-life Gotham, with the billionaire cast by his many detractors as an evil super-villain.\nIn his eponymous skyscraper he resides, tweeting maniacally, as protesters swirl angrily below fearful that he poses a mortal threat to their city and their planet.\nTrump Tower also looks more and more like a gilded cage. Only twice since election night has the billionaire left its Louis XIV-inspired confines.\nWhile he boasted during the election that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose voters, he has not stepped foot onto its sidewalks as president-elect. Now Fifth Avenue is lined with heavily armed police to prevent people from harming him.\nTellingly, most of his tweet-storms since election day have been aimed at Big Apple targets.\nFirst off, it was the protesters themselves, whom he initially claimed were professional agitators and sore losers. Then came the New York Times, for what he claimed was its inaccurate reporting about the chaos within the transition.\nNext in the cross-hairs were the cast of Hamilton, Broadway's hottest show, for its curtain call plea directed at Vice-President Mike Pence to respect the rights of all Americans.\nFinally it was Saturday Night Live, a show billed as being \"live from New York\" which has always fed off the late-night non-conformism of this city.\nNothing lays bare Donald Trump's thin skin quite like criticism from his hometown.\nThis was noticeable as well during the campaign. In the summer, Trump lashed out at \"Little Michael Bloomberg,\" after the former Mayor of New York City called him a fraud at the Democratic convention. \"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one,\" said Bloomberg.\nIn February, the billionaire also went after the New York Daily News, along with its owner Mort Zuckerman, after the tabloid likened him to the Batman villain, The Joker.\n\"Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex,\" harrumphed Trump. \"Paper will close soon!\"\nOnly this morning, Trump renewed his online trolling of the New York Times, firing off three Tweets after cancelling a meeting with its executives and editors. \"Perhaps\" a new meeting would be set up, he wrote, but, \"In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!\"\nWhat appears to have angered him is a story published by the New York Times raising questions about his business conflicts of interests, specifically at a British wind farm.\nIt was also the story that prompted Trump to suggest that Nigel Farage should become the UK ambassador in Washington.\nTrump, who critics claim is a narcissist, feeds off adulation, but he receives little of that in Manhattan. The city's super-rich club has long regarded him as a vulgar self-publicist with questionable business acumen and, by their standards, a small bank balance.\nTrump has never mustered the requisite wealth or displayed the requisite level of civic-minded altruism to join an elite whose surnames are found on hospitals, academic institutes and art galleries, rather than residential apartment buildings.\nAfter spending much of the past year or so watching and travelling with Donald Trump, I've been struck by how his physical demeanour changes when he appears in public in New York City. Not in the atrium of Trump Tower, his personal fiefdom, where his incendiary rhetoric ricochets off the marble walls, but rather when he steps outside that self-congratulatory echo chamber.\nTwo episodes come to my mind.\nThe first was when he attended the Al Smith dinner in the final weeks of the campaign, the event where candidates are supposed to make gentle fun of each other and themselves.\nFaced with a hostile crowd of New York's white-tied elite, who booed parts of his speech, Trump seemed almost sheepish. The catcalls of rich New Yorkers seemed especially wounding, and it was the first time during the campaign when he looked like he had been cowed.\nLikewise on election day, when he cast his ballot at a polling station in Manhattan, he seemed to recoil at being booed by a crowd outside. \"New York hates you!\" shouted one heckler. As he cast his ballot, there was none of the I-own-the-room showmanship and braggadocio that were the hallmark of his rally appearances in the south, in the Rust Belt, in Florida. Again, he seemed humbled by hometown hostility.\nMuch of New York has rejected Donald Trump because Donald Trump's candidacy seemed to reject the idea of New York.\nTo so many of its residents, this city is synonymous with multiculturalism, tolerance, religious freedom and globalism. Just ride the subway.\nThough its welcoming tradition is often romanticised - Ellis Island was a brutal entry point for millions of new arrivals - it has nonetheless been a gateway for immigrants drawn to this country by the rich promise of the American dream.\nIn the eyes of many progressive-minded New Yorkers, Donald Trump's campaign was primarily about hate rather than hope.\nIt explains why the iconic symbol of this city, the Statue of Liberty, has been used as a weapon against him by so many cartoonists.\nAfter the release of the Access Hollywood tape, a cartoon in Rolling Stone depicted Trump molesting Lady Liberty. Another showed Lady Liberty behind an office desk being told \"You're fired.\"\nThe Economist's cartoonist Kal showed the statue repelling the billionaire with an anguished face and out-stretched arm. \"Come on Babe!\" says the cartoon incarnation of Trump. \"Give your new boss a kiss!\"\nDuring the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas tried to torpedo Trump by saying he had New York values, which was code, among other things, for being soft on abortion and supportive of gay rights.\nBut it is precisely because the Trump presidency appears to pose a threat to New York values that so many people here are taking to the streets, some of whom have never before protested in their lives.\nThe great anthem of this city, belted out in karaoke bars the world over, posits that if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. But Donald Trump's success flies in the face of what might be called the Sinatra Doctrine.\nPolitically he has made it elsewhere, but if New York truly were a city-state - a small island off the north-east coast of America, as some of its residents sometimes prefer to think of it - the billionaire would have been buried in a landslide.\nDonald Trump may be about to become the most powerful individual on the planet, but to many in his home city he is persona non grata.", "summary": "After a year of being greeted by fawning crowds in the American heartland, Donald Trump appears to be struggling with the hostility that now surrounds him in New York City.", "id": "38019788", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"New Yorkers have voiced their displeasure with a Big Apple mix of in-your-face boisterousness and creative flair.

I thought there was something physically wrong - I thought I had heart problems,\" she said.\nA colleague told Sarah to go the doctor, where she was diagnosed as having suffered a panic attack.

Before London 2012, it was 9.76.\nEach time, he improved to win gold, but in progressively slower times as the years advanced.\nThat 9.58-second scorched-earth world record from Berlin 2009 belongs to the same man, but a different, irrevocable era.\nBolt, now 30, comes into this London edition of the World Championships, not as a sensation heralding a revolution, but instead hanging onto his empire against the challenge of Father Time and young pretenders.\nWith three rounds of the 100m, roughly 30 seconds of action, left of his career, could Bolt, weighed down with 19 World and Olympic gold medals, possibly bow out in defeat?\nBolt may never have been slower before a major championship, but the threats to him have rarely been less clear.\nThe fastest man this year is Christian Coleman.\nThe American's best of 9.82 seconds was one of six occasions on which he dipped under 10 seconds this season.\nJust 21, Coleman's expanding portfolio of performances attracted a seven-figure sponsorship deal from Nike as the sportswear giant made him their bet as Bolt's long-term successor.\nColeman has a marked lack of major championship experience however.\nHe told the Daily Telegraph that he was \"pretty much a deer in the highlights\" at the Rio Olympics where he appeared in the heats of the 4x100m relay.\nThe final of the United States trials - the biggest race of his season - delivered only his fifth-fastest time of the year and second place.\nBolt's old sparring partner Justin Gatlin was the man who beat Coleman.\nThe 35-year-old claims he feels back to his 100m heyday when he won Olympic and world titles in 2004 and 2005, a time predating both Bolt's emergence and his own two doping bans.\nHe will need to be.\nHe has only beaten Bolt once in his long career  - at a Diamond League meeting in Rome in 2013.\nBy contrast in major finals in 2012, 2013, 2016 and most notably at the world championships in Beijing 2015 when Gatlin came into the final faster and favoured, he was left in the Jamaican great's wake.\nIf you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote.\nYohan Blake is the second fastest man in the world this year - and of all time, behind Bolt.\nHe profited when Bolt fouled out of the 2011 World Championships and did the 100m-200m double in his compatriot's absence in the Jamaican trials this year.\nBut the 27-year-old has been hindered by a run of injuries in recent seasons and pulled out of the Diamond League meeting in Rabat in mid-July with a groin problem.\nIf Nike plumped for Coleman, Puma - Usain Bolt's own shoe sponsor - signed up Andre de Grasse in a multi-year, multi-million deal in 2015 as their pick for the next 100m superstar.\nIt seemed a good choice when the Canadian won bronze in Rio last summer. Less so this season however. Having struggled for form - he is only the 23rd fastest in the world - he has now pulled out of London 2017 with a hamstring tear.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer 1500m world champion and BBC Sport commentator Steve Cram\nUsain Bolt would not have given this field a second thought two or three years ago. He is not as good as he was. But he doesn't have to be.\nWhatever we have seen so far, he will be better in London.\nAnd what we have seen so far, in my opinion, is not that bad.\nIn Monaco, where he ran his season's best of 9.95 seconds a fortnight ago, I thought he looked pretty good.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI don't think he has been pushing harder than he has to to win so far this season - he has been steady out of the blocks, getting up to speed, pulling clear and then throttling off.\nHe has managed to adapt the demands he makes on himself pretty well in the last few years.\nYou also have to look around. Bolt is not as fast as he was, but where is the threat coming from?\nColeman is a bit of a raw talent without the experience that counts for so much in major finals. Blake has had a couple of injuries, and then you come back to the same-old in Justin Gatlin.\nSouth Africa's Akani Simbine has been under 10 seconds eight times this season, but has tended to run his fast times early in the season at home and then has not reproduced in major finals. There would be a lot of people very surprised if he stepped up to that level.\nI would always rather be in Usain Bolt's camp than anyone else's.\nMaybe London 2017 doesn't really matter anyway.\nLess than victory would end Bolt's gold run in the blue riband event, but it would be a blemish to bother only the most particular completists.\nThe specifics of Saturday's night final at London Stadium will slowly fade to footnotes on Bolt's career.\nIt won't be the heap of titles or spreadsheets seconds, but yawning winning margins as wide as Bolt's grin that define his legacy.\nBefore Bolt arrived, sprinting was a serious, testosterone-soaked business.\nThe likes of Linford Christie, Leroy Burrell, Maurice Greene and Donavon Bailey snarled and strutted on the start-line, as quick to take offence as they were over the ground. Bolt ushered in an era of slacker-chic.\nHe shunned the twitchy thousand-yard stare and instead clowned his way to greatness.

Previously the best known video of Philby was him giving a 1955 press conference in his mother's London flat.\nOn that occasion he said very little, only denying he was a communist.\nIn this newly discovered video, for the first time, we hear Philby himself boast about what he calls his \"30 years in the enemy camp\".\nHe describes himself as born into \"the ruling class of the British Empire\" and explains how he first was drawn towards communism at Cambridge.\nHe details his recruitment by the Soviet intelligence service, later known as the KGB, after he returned from working with activists in Austria.\nThe most surprising thing about his recruitment, he says, was that it happened at all since he had no real job or prospects at that moment.\n\"It was essentially a long range project. No immediate results were expected or could have been expected.\"\nHe says his Soviet contact did express his ambitions for his recruit.\n\"It was made perfectly clear to me that the best target in the eyes of the Centre in Moscow would be the British Secret Service.\"\nPhilby details how he spent years trying to work his way in - turning to journalism, working for The Times newspaper, covering the Spanish Civil War, building up contacts in the establishment and then as war came dropping hints about his desire to work for government.\nAt last, he was interviewed and accepted in to the inner sanctum of the British state - the Secret Intelligence Service - SIS (or as it is popularly known MI6).\nIn one of the most remarkable sections of the talk, Philby then reveals just how easy it was to steal secrets from Britain's secret service.\nHe says that he simply made friends with the archivist who managed the files by going out two or three times a week for a drink with him.\nThis allowed Philby to get hold of files which had nothing to do with his own job.\n\"If there had been proper discipline in the handling of papers in SIS that would have been quite impossible.\n\"But there was, in fact, no discipline.\"\nPhilby goes on to explain what he did with all the documents.\n\"Every evening I left the office with a big briefcase full of reports that I had written myself, full of files and actual documents from the archive.\n\"I used to hand them to my Soviet contact in the evening.\n\"The next morning I would get the files back, the contents having been photographed and early the next morning I would put them back in their place. That I did regularly year in year out.\"\nPhilby, a Soviet agent, is then appointed number two in a new MI6 section, devoted to countering Soviet espionage.\nHis KGB handler next instructs him to get the top job by removing his boss, Felix Cowgill.\n\"I said 'Are you proposing to shoot him or something?'\" Philby recalls asking.\nInstead his instructions were to use bureaucratic intrigue.\n\"So I set about the business of removing my own chief. You oughtn't to listen to this,\" he tells the audience of secret service officers to considerable laughter.\nHe succeeded.\n\"It was a very dirty story - but after all our work does imply getting dirty hands from time to time but we do it for a cause that is not dirty in any way,\" Philby explains.\n\"I have to admit that was the most blatant intrigue against a man I rather liked and I admired but the instructions stood and nothing I could do would alter them.\"\nThere is one episode which is usually cited to illustrate the human cost of Philby's treachery.\nWhen he was posted to Washington DC as MI6's liaison with the CIA and FBI, he betrayed an operation to secretly send thousands of Albanians back into their country to overthrow the communist regime.\nMany were killed.\nIn his lecture, Philby tries to turn it to his credit - even claiming he helped prevent World War Three.\nHe claims that if he had not compromised the operation and it had succeeded, the CIA and MI6 would have tried it again in countries like Bulgaria.\nHe says the Soviet Union would then have become involved, leading to an all-out war.\nWhile he was in Washington, two fellow Cambridge spies, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, fled to Moscow, leading to suspicions about Philby and his interrogation.\nHe says there were two reasons why he got away with his espionage for so long.\nThe first was the British class system, which could not accept one of their own was a traitor.\nThe second was the fact that so many in MI6 had so much to lose if he was proven to be a spy.\nPhilby did officially leave MI6 but remarkably was soon taken back.\nHe became an agent based in Beirut under cover of being a newspaper journalist. This allowed him to resume his spying.\nPhilby ends the formal section of his talk with an account of his escape from Beirut which he uses to mock MI6.\nIn 1963, an MI6 colleague came to confront him with new evidence pointing to his work for the Soviets.\nPhilby bluffed and stalled. Another MI6 officer was then left to watch over him.\nBut that man was an avid skier.\nPhilby says that news came in of a fresh snowfall and the officer could not resist heading off to the Lebanese mountains to make the most of it.\nAt that point, Philby got the signal from the KGB for his departure and was able to slip away.\nPhilby then sits down and takes questions from the East German spies.\nA fascinating first answer explains how he first acquired his communist beliefs and was then able to hold on to them despite living in the West.\nHe praises his Soviet handler and advises his audience that they need to take care of the political as well as physical health of any agents they run.\nPhilby finishes with one piece of advice to the spies gathered before him that had served him well: never confess.\n\"If they confront you with a document with your own handwriting then it's a forgery - just deny everything\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\"They interrogated me to break my nerve and force me to confess.\n\"And all I had to do really was keep my nerve. So my advice to you is to tell all your agents that they are never to confess.\"\nThis video, designed to be secret, is a chance to see Philby giving his own account of his life as a spy.\nThe tone is

Mr Clarke told BBC Sport he wanted to ensure potential victims \"felt safe\" to come forward and \"report terrible crimes\".\nAllegations of abuse within football surfaced last week, when Mr Woodward, 43, spoke publicly about his abuse by former Crewe coach and youth football scout Barry Bennell.\nTwo other players who say they were abused by Bennell will also waive their right to anonymity to speak on Friday's edition of the Victoria Derbyshire programme (09:00 GMT, BBC Two). They came forward after seeing Mr Woodward's interview.\nOn Thursday, Manchester City released a statement saying: \"The club is aware of allegations that Barry Bennell had an association with Manchester City Football Club in the 1980s. As a result the club is currently undertaking a thorough investigation of any past links he might have had with the organisation.\"\nAccording to the Guardian, an anonymous ex-footballer has also contacted police to say he was a victim of George Ormond - a former Newcastle United youth coach who was jailed in 2002 for offences against young footballers in the area.\nA spokesman for Northumbria Police told the Guardian it had received an allegation of \"historic sexual offences in Newcastle\" and inquiries were ongoing.\nOrmond was sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against boys aged between 13 and 21 committed between 1974 and 1994.\nThe judge called him a \"predatory abuser of young boys\" who \"used his position as a football coach to target vulnerable children\" and \"prevented disclosure by the power wielded over them as their coach\".\nMr Stewart, 52, who started his career at Blackpool and also played for Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool, first told the Daily Mirror an unnamed coach - not Bennell - abused him daily for four years up to the age of 15.\nIn an emotional interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Mr Stewart said he believed there were \"hundreds of victims\" of sexual abuse who could come forward.\nHe also claimed:\nMr Stewart said he finally escaped his alleged abuser at the age of 15, signing for Blackpool, where he made his professional debut at 17.\n\"I was told that I had to do these things if I wanted to be a footballer,\" he said. \"I only ever wanted to be a footballer as a child. He was threatening that he would kill my parents and my two brothers if I ever spoke out. I was just absolutely frightened.\"\nAsked if he feared the allegations football is facing could be as big as the Savile scandal, he told the BBC: \"Yes, I do, for sure. I would almost guarantee it as long as the victims are willing to come forward.\"\nAfter his death, former DJ and television presenter Savile was found to be one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators.\nMr Stewart also spoke of the heartache of having to show his family the Mirror story before it was published, saying he had been unable to show his son and two daughters in person.\nHe added: \"This has not been easy for me to do.\n\"But I felt that I needed to do this so other people will come out and with the hope that it may stop anyone who may be thinking of doing it again, in any walk of life - not just football.\"\nHe added: \"The access to children at sport level is very easy and it is the perfect ground for them to prey.\n\"I do believe, in the days it was happening to me, it was a taboo subject, nobody spoke about it. It was brushed under the carpet if it was happening. I don't think there was anywhere to turn in those days.\"\nSports minister Tracey Crouch said the former players had shown \"incredible bravery\" to speak about the abuse.\nShadow sports minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan warned the scandal could \"seriously damage\" UK football's reputation.\nThe NSPCC said callers to the abuse hotline had raised concerns about children now and in the past, and it expected \"many more\" to come forward.\nInformation from 20 callers would be passed to police, the children's charity said.\nManchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney, an NSPCC ambassador, said: \"It's awful that some of my colleagues have suffered this way whilst playing the sport that I and they love. It's important that people know that it's OK to speak out, there is help available and that they don't need to suffer in silence.\"\nBennell was sentenced to nine years in prison in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys.\nHe was a youth coach at Crewe Alexandra in the 1980s and 1990s and also had a close association with Stoke City and Manchester City.\nCheshire Police said 11 people had come forward since Mr Woodward spoke out, including fellow ex-Crewe player Mr Walters, 44, who says he was also a victim of Bennell.\nFormer Manchester City and England player Mr White, 49, says Bennell abused him between 1979 and 1980 while he was playing for Whitehill FC junior team in Manchester.\nSo far, Greater Manchester Police has not received any official reports of abuse but, in a statement, it said any victim should have confidence officers would treat complaints seriously and thoroughly investigate them.\nOn Thursday evening, police were seen at Bennell's address in Milton Keynes, removing a dog and some boxes.\nCrewe's director of football Dario Gradi, who has been associated with the club for more than 30 years, released a statement saying he knew nothing about Bennell's abuse of young footballers until his arrest in the US in 1994.\n\"I knew nothing of his crimes before this time when he was employed by us,\" said Mr Gradi, who managed the club from 1983 to 2007 and for short spells afterwards.\n\"No-one at the football club knew of Bennell's crimes until his arrest in 1994 and his subsequent prosecution in the UK.\"\nHe said he would make no further comment until Crewe had carried out a review.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said it expected the number of people coming forward to rise.\nPFA chief executive Gordon Taylor told BBC Sport: \"There's always talk of hidden agendas and cover-ups. I can only speak from my own experience and the PFA's point of view. There's no cover up. It's our business to help players and resolve problems.\n\"We have seen an increase in the number of players to come forward. We can only do our best. There might be youngsters that this caused them not to have a career in the game. We need to encompass the whole lot.\"\nFormer FA chief executive, Mark Palios, told the BBC he was not surprised by the allegations.\nHe said it would be \"naive\" to suggest abuse has not gone on within the game.\n\"It's an issue like racism - you can't be complacent that you've actually dealt with it. But I'm pretty certain that the position today is far better than it was 20 to 30 years ago when it was pretty much un-regulated.\"\nThe FA's head of equality and safeguarding, Sue Ravenlaw, said the \"courage and dignity\" shown by the four footballers who have spoken out was \"immense\".", "summary": "\"Hundreds\" of children may have been sexually abused by figures within football, former Tottenham and England player Paul Stewart has told the BBC.", "id": "38093957", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe FA's head of equality and safeguarding, Sue Ravenlaw, said the \"courage and dignity\" shown by the four footballers who have spoken out was \"immense\".\nThe FA's head of equality", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe BBC's Panorama programme has revealed that former Crewe Alexandra youth coach Barry Bennell abused young footballers in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe programme said Bennell, who was jailed in 1994 for 15 years for abusing young footballers, was also a coach at Manchester City and Stoke City.\nThe FA said it was \"shocked and saddened", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe FA has said it will not comment on the allegations until it has investigated them.\nThe FA has said it will not comment on the allegations until it has investigated them.\nThe FA has said it will not comment on the allegations until it has investigated them.

This is why - because we feel that our national security is in danger.\"\nThis twin campaign has come at a difficult time for the world's second biggest oil producer and exporter.\nOil prices have dropped by more than 60% from their highs, resulting in budget shortfalls and a nationwide cutback in contracts and hiring.\nThe Yemen war is draining Saudi coffers at an alarming rate, but there is another factor the leadership in Riyadh must contend with: the mounting international opposition to its air strikes in Yemen, where an estimated 6,000 people have been killed by the past 12 months of war.\nAir strikes have reportedly caused about half the fatalities, although the Saudis dispute this.\nWhereas few people aside from IS and their supporters object to Saudi air strikes on the jihadists in Syria, the air strikes in Yemen are highly controversial.\nIn February, the European Parliament voted by a large majority for an EU-wide arms embargo on Saudi Arabia, blaming its air strikes for what it called the \"disastrous humanitarian situation\" in Yemen.\nFor the past 12 months, the US has been helping the Saudi-led campaign with refuelling, satellite and other intelligence, while both the US and UK have sold both aircraft and high-precision missiles to Saudi Arabia.\nAccording to the London-based Campaign Against Arms Trade, the UK has licensed \u00c2\u00a32.8bn ($4bn) of arms to Saudi Arabia since the air strikes began there in March 2015.\n\"Thousands of Yemeni civilians have been killed and injured in devastating and indiscriminate Saudi coalition airstrikes,\" says Amnesty International, \"and there's strong evidence that further weapons sales to Saudi Arabia are not just ill-advised but actually illegal.\"\nThe Saudis strongly reject this, pointing out that Yemen's Houthi rebels started the war by overrunning the capital and ousting the UN-recognised government and that the Houthis, backed by ousted former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, are committing daily abuses on the civilian population.\nStung by this international condemnation, the Saudis agreed to let me into their Air Operations Centre (AOC) inside the King Salman Airbase in Riyadh.\nThis is where Saudi intelligence officers, alongside their coalition partners, mostly from allied Arab countries, select their targets and generate the Air Tasking Orders (ATOs) to squadrons based around the country to carry out the air strikes.\nIn the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) cell, officers insisted that every single target was triple checked that it complied with International Humanitarian Law and the Law of Armed Conflict.\nAs part of what the Saudis call collateral damage mitigation (CDM), they told me they normally avoid hitting anything within 500m of civilians, an assertion likely to be challenged by Yemenis on the ground.\nIn some circumstances, said the Saudi officers, this safety margin is reduced to 200m when they use a high-precision laser-guided bomb.\nThey denied that their warplanes have ever deliberately targeted civilians, though they admitted there have been mistakes.\nUpon the wall was a large digital map of Yemen with locations highlighted in green and red. This, I was told, is their No Strike List, a map of all the buildings they said are off-limits.\n\"The overall picture as you see on the map represents the theatre of operations,\" said Lt Col Turki al-Maliki, of the Royal Saudi Air Force.\nZooming into a close-up of the streets of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, he added: \"This gives the restriction of those targets which go along with the Law of Armed Conflict like the medical places, historical places, schools, diplomatic quarters.\"\nI pointed out that, to quote just one example alone, the humanitarian aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) complain their hospitals have been hit by air strikes three times in under three months.\nGen al-Assiri replied that world audiences have been deceived about the true situation in Yemen.\n\"No single accident happens without investigation,\" he told me. \"And when we investigate, we publish the result. We make sure that we have a very clear intelligence\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We regret any single injury, but this is a war.\"\nWhen I interviewed Gen al-Assiri in Riyadh almost exactly a year ago, at the start of the Saudi-led air campaign, I sensed an expectation that the overwhelming firepower deployed against the Houthi rebels would soon force them to sue for peace.\nThat has not happened, although a Houthi delegation did visit Riyadh this month.\nThe Saudis say they will not tolerate an armed militia on their borders, especially one supported by Iran.\n\"We need time to achieve stability in Yemen,\" said Gen al-Assiri, pointing out that the US-led Nato force was in Afghanistan for 11 years and only achieved a partial success.\nThe question now is whether the Saudis have the money and the patience to be deeply involved in two coalitions on two fronts as the civilian casualty toll in Yemen grows ever higher.", "summary": "In the vast deserts of northern Saudi Arabia, close to the borders of Iraq and Kuwait, Exercise Northern Thunder has just concluded.", "id": "35785416", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "Saudi Arabia is a country that is fighting a war in Yemen, and is also fighting a war in Syria.

Great work down the left by Wallace set him up and he had a straightforward job of volleying the ball into the net.\nRangers were now cruising. Alex D'Acol did come close with a drive for Accies, but the visitors had a real grip on the game and Waghorn was running riot with growing confidence, setting up chances for Tavernier and twice for Garner.\nHamilton's star player Ali Crawford - who is enjoying a wonderful season - was unusually quiet.\nAt times Accies were in pieces. They were caught on a counter-attack that saw Tavernier run 60 yards only to blast the ball over the bar with the goalkeeper at his mercy.\nWaghorn was denied his hat-trick opportunity with Warburton taking him off with 14 minutes to go to give him the chance to take a standing ovation from the support.\nBut within a minute he might have been regretting that decision. Imrie pulled a goal back at the right-hand post, sliding the ball home just seconds after he failed to do so at the other post.\nIt made for a grandstand and nervous finish, but Rangers hung on, and Accies still have not beaten them in the league since 10 December 1938.\nHamilton player-manager Martin Canning: \"We started the game really well.

The second half started in a similar tone to the way the first half ended. They had control of the game, they were controlling the ball.\n\"We changed to go 3-5-2 to put two up front to try and stop them getting the ball out so easily, put more pressure on them higher up the park.\n\"We then concede which shouldn't happen with Lee Wallace running in behind. We talked about it all day yesterday, we know his threat going forward from left-back and we got done with it which is disappointing.

If it acted to raise the status of Jews, Israel would be undermined as a democracy and could end up with an apartheid system. Some claim this exists already.\nSeveral right-wing groups in Israel believe new ways must be found to strengthen a single state of Israel. The \"Yes to a Strong Israel\" campaign backed by settler groups has a growing presence online and in social media.\n\"I'm 10 minutes down the road from Jerusalem,\" says Rut Lieberman from Gush Etzion in the occupied West Bank. \"For people who want a two-state solution - cutting up Israel more - this would become Palestine. I'm not sure that works.\"\n\"I just drove past a contiguous Jewish population of tens of thousands of people. The two-state solution is a dead end. We have to get it off the table.\"\nAmong Israel's 500,000 settlers there is wide support for a plan by the Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) party, which joined the new Israeli government sworn in on Monday.\nIt proposes annexing the 61% of the West Bank known as \"Area C\", where Israel already has full military control. Settlers would stay, about 50,000 Palestinians living there would get Israeli citizenship, and the remaining 2.6 million Palestinian residents of the West Bank would be left under autonomous local government.\nLast November's conflict in the Gaza Strip brought another idea back into circulation - that of a separation of the Palestinian territories, or the \"three-state solution\".\nSome Israeli analysts suggested that with Hamas governing Gaza - the coastal territory should be stabilised and treated as a state separate from the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority controls Palestinian areas.\nA former Israeli national security adviser, retired Maj-Gen Giora Eiland, has proposed that in order to achieve this Israel should change its long-time policy and talk directly to Hamas.\nOthers say that Egypt - whose president is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has ideological links to Hamas - should open its border crossings with Gaza and take responsibility for it.\nEgypt and Jordan controlled Gaza and the West Bank respectively from 1948 until 1967, when Israel captured them during the Six Day War.\nSome right-wing Israelis also posit that for historic reasons, Jordan is Palestine and should provide a home for the Palestinian people. They foresee only three states remaining - Israel, Jordan and Egypt - which have already signed peace treaties.\nSuch a neat formulation overlooks the fact that Cairo, Amman and the Palestinians themselves would never agree to it.\n\"Palestinians will never melt into another entity or identity,\" says Mahdi Abdul Hadi of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs.\n\"Especially after all these years of occupation and struggle and sacrifice, Palestine cannot be moved and placed in someone else's lap.\"\nMuch to the annoyance of Israel and the US, Palestinians were granted the status of a non-member observer state at the UN General Assembly in November.\nThis has earned them the right to use the designation \"State of Palestine\" on UN documents and possibly to challenge Israel's occupation of Palestinian land before international courts.\nHowever, in real terms a sovereign Palestinian state remains as elusive as ever.\nAn opinion poll carried out last November suggested that the number of Palestinians supporting a two-state solution remained steady at 51%. But support for a bi-national solution had risen to 27%, up five percentage points from the previous year.\nThere are serious doubts - on both sides - about whether President Obama can achieve anything and whether he can be trusted.\nAn Israel Democracy Institute poll this month found that 62% of the Jewish public believed he lacked the ability to bring a real breakthrough in relations with the Palestinians.\nAs Mr Obama will no doubt find, Israeli and Palestinian leaders are divided among themselves about how to proceed and ongoing political turmoil in the region confuses the situation further.\nAt the same the conflict continues to fester and cannot be ignored.", "summary": "A \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and many international diplomats and politicians.", "id": "21850739", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

The German says neither he nor his players had realised the seriousness of the situation at first.\n\"We won the match 1-0 and the players were dancing in the changing rooms afterwards,\" he told BBC World Service's Sportsworld programme. \"Then [captain] Rigobert Song came in and cried and said \"Marco, Marco\" and told us he was dead.\n\"Everyone was shocked and was asking why. All the players were crying. I went out of the dressing room and heard two ladies crying very, very loudly. Then I saw Marco lying there, on a table, with his mother and wife by his side. I touched his leg and I went outside and cried too.\"\nPat Nevin, then chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, was broadcasting at the tournament and attended a special Cameroon news conference the following day.\n\"It was devastating for everyone involved, but there were some lifting moments,\" he remembers. \"Seven Cameroon players came out and they all spoke beautifully about their friend and team-mate and their desire to carry on in the tournament.\n\"It was a beautiful moment after a tragedy and I've been a Cameroon supporter ever since.\"\nA first autopsy failed to establish the cause of the 28-year-old's death, but a second found he been suffering from a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nThe big question everyone asked was how could a fit, athletic footballer with no known history of heart problems have died in such a way?\n\"When you looked at that Cameroon team, they were big, strong and tall, and Marc-Vivien epitomised that,\" Nevin says. \"He was a box-to-box player and his fitness was extraordinary.\"\nSanjay Sharma, Professor of Cardiology at St George's, University of London, who has worked with both Manchester City and Team GB at the 2012 Olympics, explains that the first sign of the condition is often death.\n\"People with the condition, which is characterised by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, are about three to five times more likely to suffer a cardiac arrest if exercising vigorously than leading a sedentary lifestyle,\" he says.\n\"Sadly, 80% of sportsmen who die from this condition have no prior warning signals and sudden death is the first presentation.\"\nAfter consultation with Foe's widow, Marie-Louise, as well as his parents, Fifa decided that the Confederations Cup final between France and Cameroon should go ahead as planned. Many of France's players, including striker Thierry Henry, were in tears as they lined up before the game.\nA picture of Foe was shown on the big screen ahead of the game and Cameroon's players held a huge photo of him during the trophy presentation to eventual winners France.\nThe midfielder was given a state funeral in Cameroon in July 2003. Journalist Francis N-gwa Niba, who was there, remembers: \"The funeral was huge. The president was there, [Fifa president] Sepp Blatter, everyone who was anyone in African football.\n\"Thousands stood by the side of the road outside the cathedral and I remember one banner in particular, which read 'a lion never dies, he just sleeps'.\"\nFoe left behind a wife and sons aged six and three, as well as a daughter of only two months old. The player's generosity had been legendary, and there were reports that he hadn't much money left behind.\nFoe was buried on the site of the football academy he had been having built in his hometown of Yaounde. He used to send a proportion of his wages home to his father Martin each month to fund the construction of the complex, but N-gwa Niba says it now \"sadly has practically been abandoned now because of lack of funding\".\nCameroon's Indomitable Lions have also been in decline following the death of their star midfielder. Going into the 2003 Confederations Cup they were the undoubted kings of their continent, having won the previous two African Cup of Nations tournaments, in 2000 and 2002.\nSince then, N-gwa Niba says \"Cameroon football has been going down the drain\" and they haven't won another Cup of Nations.\nFoe had been on loan at Manchester City from Lyon in the 2002-03 season, making 35 appearances and scoring nine goals. City retired his number 23 shirt after his death, while a street was named after him in Lyon.\nA positive result of Foe's death has been huge improvements in both the testing of footballers for heart problems and the treatment they receive during matches.\nProfessor Sharma admits he was shocked when he watched footage of the on-field treatment that Foe received.\n\"A player went down without any contact, his eyes rolled back, he had no tone in his body, so it was clear something terrible had gone wrong,\" he says.\n\"It took quite a while for the penny to drop that this was not going to get better with the magic sponge or fluid being poured on his head though. As cardiologists, we like resuscitation to start within a minute and a half of someone going down, and for the defibrilator to be used within three minutes.\n\"That gives us an outcome of about 70% living. Yet a good five, six minutes went by before I could see any positive action with Marc-Vivien Foe. That was perhaps because this was the first time something like this had happened in football. After all, you don't expect a champion footballer like this to go down and die.\"\nFifa's chief medical officer, Jiri Dvorak, admits big improvements had to be made following Foe's death.\n\"We have done a lot of work to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac arrest since then,\" he told BBC Sport. \"At all levels, we have examination of players before arrival at a competition.\n\"We have also trained the sideline medical teams in CPR and using defibrilators. We have a plan if something happens and the equipment - including for the team physicians of all teams. The medical personnel are adequately educated.\"\nProfessor Sharma says such improvements were in evidence when Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest during an FA Cup match against Tottenham last March.\n\"If you look at the first minutes of him going down, it was clear the medical staff quickly realised the severity of the situation,\" he said. \"The first thing I noticed in the Bolton doctor's hand was a defibrilator. They started resuscitation on the pitch and delivered two shocks before they moved him.\"\nThere will be a tribute to Foe before Wednesday's Confederations Cup semi-final between Brazil and Uruguay.\nA decade on, football will remember a fine player who grew up in poverty in Africa and went on to play in some of the biggest leagues in Europe. Foe's former team-mate, Shaka Hislop, says he will mainly remember a friendly, happy and down-to-earth man though.\nFoe arrived at West Ham in 2000 as their club record \u00a34m signing, yet could not have been more unassuming.\n\"He was much-heralded and seemingly had the world at his feet,\" says Hislop, \"but he was as genuine and likeable as they come.

Salazar insists he has a valid prescription for the drug.\nThe report:\nThe allegations about Salazar's testosterone use emerged after former NOP coach Steve Magness, athlete Kara Goucher and masseur John Stiner spoke to BBC Panorama. The trio are among dozens who have been interviewed by Usada as part of its ongoing investigation.\n...as of March 17, 2016, Mr Salazar's lawyer had still not provided additional documentation to Usada\u2026 [and therefore] has not established acceptable justification for possessing testosterone\nRule 21.2.6 of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code stipulates that athlete support personnel are strictly prohibited from possessing banned drugs without \"valid justification\".\nSalazar produced a 12,000-word public response to the BBC and ProPublica's allegations, including a letter from a specialist stating he required the testosterone for his personal use because he had been diagnosed with hypogonadism, which results in low testosterone.\nHe also said the testosterone experiment, which used his own sons as \"guinea pigs\", was designed to protect against his athletes being sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone gel on them after a race so that they would test positive.\nAccording to the leaked report, five days after the Panorama programme, Usada wrote to Salazar, asking him to provide \"all medical records for you referring to [a] condition for which you have been prescribed testosterone\".\nThe report states Salazar's lawyer produced seven documents in support of his condition, but concluded \"the documents \u2026 do not establish Mr Salazar has suffered from hypogonadism\u2026 or that he requires testosterone replacement therapy.\n\"Despite Usada's request that he do so, Mr Salazar has still produced no laboratory testing records, blood test data, examination notes, chart notes or differential diagnosis substantiating that Mr Salazar suffers from hypogonadism.\"\nThe report states \"as of March 17, 2016, Mr Salazar's lawyer had still not provided additional documentation to Usada\u2026[and therefore] has not established acceptable justification for possessing testosterone and his admitted possession of testosterone appears to have been a violation of sport anti-doping rules\".\nThe report adds that the concerns listed above are \"before even mentioning the Nike Oregon Project document which lists Galen Rupp having received 'testosterone medication' when he was a 16-year-old and being coached by Salazar, as well as Mary Decker Slaney's sanction for an elevated testosterone level while she was being coached by Salazar .\"\nSalazar and Rupp, the London 2012 10,000m silver medallist, strongly deny any wrongdoing. In a series of emails in response to BBC questions, Salazar said he would never permit doping at the Oregon Project, and that all the allegations against him were \"biased and false\".\n\"I have never rubbed any prohibited substance on Galen or any of my other athletes. These allegations and innuendo against me are malicious nonsense. I have not seen the report and the parts relayed to me are false - demonstrably false and directly refuted by documentary evidence provided to Usada.\"\nHe said: \"I believe I've done more than any coach to continuously disprove false allegations where no violation has occurred. While I am frustrated that for years now I have had to answer in the media the same, rehashed, false accusations, I take comfort in knowing, that actions speak louder than words.\n\"The Oregon Project athletes continue to earn success through talent, hard work, dedication and fair play.\n\"I voluntarily provided Usada with medical records, including blood test results, documenting that I have suffered from a diagnosed disability for more than 20 years. Usada has not requested anything additional since my last response. I find this issue very disturbing, as under US law Usada is required to make a reasonable accommodation for my disability, not persecute me.\n\"I feel that I am not required to continually, for years and without explanation, share my very personal and private medical records with Usada over a disability that has been diagnosed by multiple doctors for decades. Any insinuation by Usada that I do not suffer from this condition is offensive to me and my treating physicians, and is inexcusable.\"\nThe BBC has specifically asked Salazar on three separate occasions in recent days whether he produced any further medical evidence to Usada after 17 March, 2016 the date the leaked report was compiled. He has declined to answer this question.\nThe leaked Usada report comes after months of speculation the agency's investigation had withered away. Nine months ago, Farah said he felt vindicated after standing by Salazar.\nUK Athletics had also given Farah the all clear to keep working with him following its own investigation, saying that it had \"no reason to be concerned\".\nOn Thursday, it confirmed it would continue to have a close relationship with Salazar, who remains a consultant to UKA, unless he was charged with a doping offence.\nFarah himself, according to the report, remains under investigation over an alleged 2014 infusion of the legal supplement L-carnitine, specifically whether it breached the legal limit of 50ml.
