[{"document": "David Anderson QC said his \"central concern\" about the proposals first unveiled by David Cameron in early September was: \"Where are the courts?\"\nTemporary Exclusion Orders are one of the measures in the counter terrorism bill published by Theresa May.\nIt also includes tougher powers to stop people going abroad to fight.\nIt will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country.\nIn other developments on Wednesday:\nAnalysis by Political Correspondent Robin Brant\nThe government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations. That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.\n\"This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.\"\nThe government wants to \"fast-track\" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.\nBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.\nAmnesty International called the powers \"draconian\", adding none of the measures seemed \"properly thought through\".\nAnd Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.\"\nThe Home Office says communications data has played a major role in \"every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade\" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled.\nMrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers.\nThat bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition.\nTechnology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device.\nThe Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been \"a distinct lack of engagement\" with the industry.\nMinisters want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that \"required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used\".\nHowever, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would \"explicitly identify\" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored.\nOn Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity.\nDavid Cameron said companies had a \"social responsibility\" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier.\nFacebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.", "summary": "Concerns about plans to exclude people from the UK if they go abroad to fight with extremist groups have been raised by the UK's reviewer of terror laws.", "id": "30206231", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations.

If that is the case Wenger will have to take responsibility if things go wrong again.\nArsenal played a high-pressing game in the first half against Liverpool but they could not sustain that tempo for 90 minutes - it is virtually impossible for any team.\nWhen the Gunners stopped doing it, in the second half at Emirates Stadium, they conceded a flurry of goals but very rarely will they come up against a team that plays so well for such an intense period of a game.\nYes, Arsenal could have defended better, kept their shape better and played more percentage football but Liverpool's performance in that 20-minute spell was pretty sensational and they scored some absolutely brilliant goals.\nSo I don't think Wenger will be overly concerned that will happen to his team every week, and he certainly will not be worried about it against Leicester. I don't think Arsenal will try to press the Foxes in the same way.\nI would imagine he and the Arsenal players believe they can go to the King Power Stadium, dominate the ball and cause more problems than the Foxes can cause them.\nThey did it last season, when they won 5-2, and they will think that once again they have more quality on the pitch so they will create more chances and be able to win the game playing that way too.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLeicester also lost last week, going down to a surprise defeat at Hull.\nBut I did not read too much into the Foxes' poor performance because their defence was missing Robert Huth, whose organisation and presence was absolutely pivotal in their title win.\nHuth is back from his ban on Saturday and he might not be the only familiar face back in Ranieri's starting XI.\nAgainst Hull, he left out Marc Albrighton and Shinji Okazaki from the team that played almost every game last season.\nI understand why he did it - because he is trying to move his team forward - but it is hard to do that while retaining the same ethos that brought them their success.\nThey will be desperate for three points from their first home game of the season, and a tried and tested line-up might be the way to get it. They are likely to return to their regular way of playing too.\nLeicester only had more possession than their opponents in five of their 38 league games last season, but they had marginally more of the ball than Hull last weekend - 50.3%.\nThe Tigers sat deep and did not allow them to play to their strengths on the break but against Arsenal the game is far more likely to follow a pattern that suits Ranieri's fast attackers.\nI also think Leicester have to be careful not to believe their own hype now they are champions, start to over-play and forget their strengths.\nIt can easily happen - I played in teams where we did that when we just won a few games in a row, for example at Fulham when we were on a good run and got a bit confident.\nWe still had Bobby Zamora up top, who we could play long to, get the ball into his chest and play off him but at times he would be screaming at us to give him the ball because we would be passing it around at the back thinking we were a good side.\nAll of a sudden teams were pressing us, nicking the ball and causing us problems, and we had to rethink, and remember what was getting us results.\nLeicester have bright players and a clever manager so I do not see that being a massive issue for them, especially on Saturday. Arsenal will come at them and leave space behind their defence for them to pump it up there for Jamie Vardy to get in the channels and cause havoc.\nThis is a big game for Vardy, against the team he turned down over the summer.\nHe was visibly frustrated at missing the chances he got against Hull and, facing Arsenal, he will be determined to prove a point and show them why they wanted him.\nThere is the chance the circumstances mean he could try a little bit too hard to make things happen instead of just playing naturally but it will be hard to tell because he looks like he gives absolutely everything in every game anyway.\nI actually thought he was a bit unlucky not to score against Hull because he was only denied by a tremendous block.\nYes, he also blazed one shot over the bar which is unlike him but he set himself ridiculously high standards last season and it will be very difficult for him to maintain that ratio.\nIt is the same for any striker, and can happen for a variety of reasons but I do not see it becoming an issue for Vardy because the way he plays and the way his team plays means he is always going to get chances, including against Arsenal.\nThe occasion is set up for him and, the way he is, it certainly would not surprise me if he goes and bangs in the winner.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "Arsenal's trip to defending champions Leicester is a huge game for both teams, but it is especially important for Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.", "id": "37092824", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nArsenal's defence is fragile and they are not capable of shutting out Leicester.\nArsenal will dominate the Foxes and win the game playing that way.\nLeicester will return to their regular way of playing.\nLeicester have to be careful not to believe their own hype now they are champions.\nLeicester have bright players and a clever manager.\nLeicester will come at Arsenal and leave space behind", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nArsenal's opening day defeat at home to Liverpool was a big disappointment for them and their fans.\nThey were not at their best but they were still the better team and should have won the game.\nThey were not clinical enough in front of goal and, when they did get chances, they did not take them.\nThey were also not as solid at the back as they have been in recent seasons and that was a big problem.\nThey have a lot", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nDanny Murphy: \"I think it is a big game for Leicester.

The BBC cannot visit the area to verify what is occurring there, as journalists and aid workers have been barred.\nThe Rohingya, who number about one million, are seen by many of Myanmar's Buddhist majority as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.\nAlthough Bangladesh's official policy is not to allow in illegal entrants across the border, the foreign ministry has confirmed that thousands of Rohingya have already sought refuge in the country, while thousands more are reportedly gathering on the border.\nSome are using smugglers to get into Bangladesh, while others have bribed border guards, according to Amnesty International.\nEfforts to resolve the issue must focus on \"the root cause\" inside Myanmar, Mr McKissick, head of the UN refugee agency UNHCR in the Bangladeshi border town of Cox's Bazar, told BBC Bengali's Akbar Hossain.\nHe said the Myanmar military and Border Guard Police had \"engaged in collective punishment of the Rohingya minority\" after the murders of nine border guards on 9 October which some politicians blamed on a Rohingya militant group.\nSecurity forces have been \"killing men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to cross the river\" into Bangladesh, Mr McKissick said.\n\"Now it's very difficult for the Bangladeshi government to say the border is open because this would further encourage the government of Myanmar to continue the atrocities and push them out until they have achieved their ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority in Myanmar,\" he said.\nNobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is in a delicate position. She is Myanmar's de facto leader, but security is under the control of the autonomous armed forces.\nIf Ms Suu Kyi bows to international pressure and sets up a credible investigation into the alleged abuses in Rakhine state, she risks fracturing her relationship with the army. It could jeopardise the stability of her young government.\nSo for the last six weeks Ms Suu Kyi has kept her head firmly in the sand, avoiding journalists and press conferences.\nWhen forced, she has commented that the military in Rakhine is operating according to the \"rule of law\". Few believe that to be the case.\nWhile there are loud calls from overseas for action, most Burmese have very little sympathy for the Rohingya. The army's \"clearance operations\" against the \"violent attackers\" of Rakhine state appear to have strong popular support, putting Ms Suu Kyi under very little domestic pressure.\nMyanmar's presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said Mr McKissick \"should maintain his professionalism and his ethics as a United Nations officer because his comments are just allegations\".\n\"He should only speak based on concrete and strong evidence on the ground,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, the Bangladesh foreign ministry summoned Myanmar's ambassador to express \"deep concern\" over the military operation in northern Rakhine state.\nIt said \"desperate people\" were crossing the border seeking safety and shelter and asked Myanmar to \"ensure the integrity of its border\".\nAuthorities in Bangladesh have been detaining and repatriating hundreds of fleeing Rohingya, which Amnesty International condemned as a violation of international law.\nBangladesh does not recognise Rohingya as refugees, and many of those fleeing Myanmar have been \"forced into hiding and are suffering a severe lack of food and medical care\", the rights group said.\nRohingya refugees and asylum-seekers have arrived into Bangladesh from Myanmar in waves since at least the 1970s. There are some 33,000 registered Rohingya refugees living in Cox's Bazar's two camps, Kutupalong and Nayapara.\nEarlier this week, Human Rights Watch released satellite images which it said showed that more than 1,200 homes had been razed in Rohingya villages over the past six weeks.\nA massive security operation was launched last month after nine police officers were killed in co-ordinated attacks on border posts in Maungdaw.\nSome government officials blamed a militant Rohingya group for the attacks. Security forces then sealed off access to Maungdaw district and launched a counter-insurgency operation.\nRohingya activists say more than 100 people have been killed and hundreds arrested amid the crackdown.\nSoldiers have also been accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, rape and executions, which the government has flatly denied.\nIt says militants have attacked helicopter gunships providing air support to troops.\nThe estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are seen by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship by the government despite many having lived there for generations.\nCommunal violence in Rakhine state in 2012 left scores dead and displaced more than 100,000 people, with many Rohingya still remaining in decrepit camps.\nThey face widespread discrimination and mistreatment.\nHundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having left Myanmar over decades.\nMyanmar held its first openly contested election in 25 years last November, with Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning a landslide victory.\nThough she is barred from the presidency due to a constitutional rule, Ms Suu Kyi, who serves as State Counsellor, is seen as de-facto leader.\nBut her government, led as it is by a former human rights icon, has faced international criticism over the dire situation in Rakhine state.\nRights groups have questioned why journalists and aid workers are not being allowed to enter northern Rakhine.\nPresidential spokesman Zaw Htay says the international media is misreporting what is going on.", "summary": "Myanmar is seeking the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Rohingya minority from its territory, a senior UN official has told the BBC.", "id": "38091816", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar.\nThe government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been conducting counter-insurgency operations since coordinated attacks on border guards in October.\nIt denies reports of atrocities.\nA spokesman said the government was \"very, very disappointed\" by the comments.\nBurmese officials say Rohingya are setting fire to their own houses in northern", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya are not recognized as citizens by the government.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to travel freely.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to marry.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to have children.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to have a job.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to have an education.\nThe R", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya are not recognized as citizens of Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to vote in Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to travel outside of Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to marry outside of the Rohingya community.\nThe Rohingya are not allowed to have more than two children", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\n1.

It is one of the most powerful questions in politics and Ed Miliband believes it is the key to seeing him installed in Downing Street.\nThat's why Labour is targeting the so-called non-doms today. They're very rich, often foreign and enjoy a lifestyle that makes them resented by anyone who's struggled to make ends meet in recent years.\nThat is, incidentally, the same reason George Osborne targeted them to pay more when he was in opposition and increased the annual tax charge some pay in his last Budget.\nLet's be clear though, these people are not tax dodgers. They pay tax on their UK earnings plus an annual charge of \u00a330,000 or more to have a totally legal tax status that Gordon Brown as well as George Osborne decided to keep as they were advised they risked losing more in tax by scrapping it than keeping it.\nRead Nick's full blog\nRobert Peston: Are non-doms bad for the UK?\nIn his Autumn Statement in December, Chancellor George Osborne announced a new \u00a390,000 charge for people who are non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes but have lived there for 17 of the past 20 years.\nThe previous Labour government introduced a \u00a330,000 charge for people resident in the UK for seven of the previous 10 years but who were non-domiciled for tax purposes.\nUnder Labour's proposals, no new people will be able to claim non-dom status after April 2016 while existing non-doms would have a \"short period\" to adjust their tax affairs.\nTemporary exemptions of about two or three years would be available for students and foreign workers seconded to the UK for a short period of time, in consultation with business and universities.\nThis election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nIn a speech at the University of Warwick, Mr Miliband said non-dom status was an \"arcane 200-year rule\", allowing a \"few people at the top\" to \"operate under different rules\".\nHe said: \"There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain like you and me, are permanently settled here in Britain, like you and me, were brought up here, but just aren't required to pay taxes like you and me.\"\nWhat is non-domicile status?\nQ&A: What is a non-dom?\nMr Miliband said he did not blame non-doms who were only \"playing by the rules\" but he insisted: \"It isn't fair, it isn't just and it holds Britain back and we will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule.\"\nIn a series of media interviews on Wednesday, Mr Balls endorsed the proposed changes, saying the clampdown could raise at least \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" and rejected claims it would lead to an exodus of businessmen.\n\"When we introduced tougher rules in 2008, people said people would leave the country,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \"That isn't what has happened.\"\nIn a BBC interview in January, Mr Balls said he would be \"tougher\" on non-doms but appeared to cast doubt on axing their tax status as a whole.\nHe told BBC Radio Leeds: \"If you abolish the whole status, then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who then leave the country.\"\nAsked on Wednesday afternoon about his earlier comment, Mr Balls said he had been speaking about the need to find a solution in relation to short-term visitors to the UK.\nHe accused the Conservatives of \"throwing up a smokescreen\" around Labour's policy to hide the fact it would \"keep these unfair rules\".\nLabour said that in January, it was considering whether genuine temporary residents should be allowed any future leeway and that Mr Balls' comments then were in no way \"inconsistent\" with what it was now proposing.\nMr Osborne said: \"Labour's policy is a total shambles... You have Ed Balls admitting it will cost Britain money and then when you look at the small print it turns out the majority of non-doms won't be affected so the headlines are misleading.\"\nThe Conservatives said they had taken the \"right approach\" in increasing the annual levy on non-doms and would continue to tackle abuse of the existing rules through a \u00a35bn crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance.\nThe Liberal Democrats have also pledged to increase non-dom charges and reform eligibility criteria, saying this could raise an extra \u00a3130m.\nLeader Nick Clegg said \"the wheels are coming off\" Labour's announcement and \"in pursuing a headline they forgot that we must remain an open economy but of course not an economy that is open to abuse\".\nThe Green Party said the changes \"could not come a moment too soon\" while UKIP said aspects of the non-dom rules were \"ludicrous\" but any reform must be thought through to ensure it didn't disadvantage the public finances.\nSubscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.", "summary": "Labour has defended its plans to end the non-domicile rule that allows some wealthy UK residents to limit the tax paid on earnings outside the country.", "id": "32213003", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nEd Miliband: Non-dom tax rule 'unfair'\nEd Miliband: Non-dom tax rule 'unfair' - BBC News\nEd Miliband: Non-dom tax rule 'unfair' - BBC News.\nEd Miliband: Non-dom tax rule 'unfair'\nEd Miliband has said the non-dom tax rule is \"unfair\" and should be scrapped.\nThe Labour leader", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the comments, in a BBC interview ahead of the election campaign, appeared to contradict what he and his leader were saying now about the party's most significant announcement so far.\nHe said: \"It's a bit of a mess.

The visit is taking place following Mrs McAleese's invitation.\nThe Queen shook hands with the president at the front of the residence before moving inside to meet the Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny.\nThe Irish flag and the union jack flew side by side at the gates to the building, where both countries' national anthems were played.\nA 21-gun salute and an Air Corps flypast also marked the Queen's arrival.\nShe and Prince Philip signed the visitors' book in the residence's lavish state ballroom, before having lunch with the president and her husband.\nKing George V was the last monarch to visit the country, in 1911, when what is now the Republic was then part of the UK.\nUK Prime Minister Cameron will join the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh for part of their trip on Wednesday, while Foreign Secretary William Hague is following the usual practice of accompanying the royals throughout their visit.\nFollow Peter Hunt's coverage of the royal visit\nFollow Mark Simpson on Twitter\nThe Queen will attend events this week at the National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge and Croke Park stadium.\nCroke Park is the home of Gaelic games where in 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, British forces fired into the crowd at a football match, killing 14 spectators and players.\nThe Queen is also to make a speech at a state dinner at Dublin Castle.\nThere are also plans for the Queen and Prince Philip to visit the Irish National Stud in County Kildare, as well as the Rock of Cashel in County Tipperary and a technology park in Cork.\nThe bomb on the bus was found in a holdall in the luggage compartment on Monday night during a check in Maynooth, County Kildare, to the west of Dublin.\nAbout 30 people who were on board the bus were taken off and transported to Dublin in another vehicle.\nThe device was later made safe in a controlled explosion carried out by an Irish army bomb disposal team.\nA coded bomb threat relating to London had been received on Sunday, the first issued by Irish dissidents outside Northern Ireland in 10 years, officials said.\nHowever, the threat level for Northern Ireland-related terrorism in Britain remains unchanged at substantial. In Northern Ireland it is severe.\nThe cost of the security operation has been estimated at 30 million euros (\u00c2\u00a326m), with measures including:\nRichard Boyd Barrett, who represents the People Before Profit party, criticised the expense of the state visit.\n\"We don't need to spend 30 million euros on a big circus bringing over one of the wealthiest women in the world to parade around the streets of Dublin and shut the city down for a few days to tell us what we already know, which is we are friends of the people of Britain,\" he said.\nTuesday 17 May: Visit to the official residence of the Irish president, Mary McAleese and tree planting ceremony.

Missing was the relentless immigrant bashing. In its place was a focus on his economic message, boasts about the breadth of his support and a more humble call to arms.\n\"Tomorrow, we go back to work,\" Mr Trump concluded.\nOf course, old habits die hard, and the following day at rallies in Indiana and Maryland Mr Trump sounded a bit more like his old self. Ted Cruz was \"Lyin' Ted\" once more, and he revelled in the crowd's chants to \"build the wall\" along the US-Mexico border.\nDuring a television interview, however, Mr Trump shed some additional light on his changing demeanour. During the rough-and-tumble, crowded primary process, he said, he had to mix it up with his fellow candidates.\n\"If I didn't, if I acted very presidential, I wouldn't be sitting up here today, somebody else might be,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be me.\"\nHe said, however, that a change is coming \"very soon\".\n\"At the right time, I will be so presidential, you will be so bored,\" he said. \"You will say, 'Can he have a little bit more energy?' But I know when to be presidential.\"\n(Somewhere out there, Jeb \"low energy\" Bush must be laughing through his tears.)\nFor the remaining three months before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland - and beyond - Mr Trump will have to walk a fine line. Authentic but controlled. A rebel who knows how to play nice.\nCan he pivot without losing his balance? It depends how three groups respond to Mr Trump's efforts, which will include detailed policy speeches over the coming weeks and fewer late-night Twitter dust-ups and talk-show taunting.\nMr Trump's legions have seen their candidate relentlessly savaged by his competitors, media commentators and independent attack advertisements.\nThey've watched as Mr Trump has occasionally tied himself in knots over issues like abortion, appeared hopelessly out-of-his-depth during detailed foreign policy questioning, and expressed views on the Iraq War and Planned Parenthood that usually constitute conservative heresy.\nAnd yet his base level of support has remained remarkably stable.\n\"I have the most loyal people,\" Mr Trump said in January. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters.\"\nFor his dedicated followers, Mr Trump is unassailable. They have an extreme distrust of the Republican Party establishment and the media (which they regularly heckle during Trump campaign rallies). So a few articles in the  Washington Post and the New York Times revealing that the bellicose, unfiltered Donald Trump of the primary season is nothing more than a \"persona\" will likely be met with a shrug.\nMr Trump's pivot could have problems, but his supporters aren't among them.\nThere was a point during the Republican primary campaign, shortly after Mr Trump's dominating wins in the 1 March Super Tuesday states and two weeks later in Florida, where the Republican Party seemed to be making peace with the prospect of a Donald Trump nomination.\nThen a combination of candidate excesses and campaign rally violence caused the party powers to have second (third and fourth) thoughts.\nMr Trump's new campaign team, with Manafort in charge, is trying to undo that damage.\nThe reality is that the Republican establishment - including both the committed and uncommitted delegates who will be in the hall at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland - don't have to love Donald Trump, but they have to at least be able to live with him.\nIf Mr Trump spends the next two months as he has the last six, barrelling through the news cycles with one outlandish controversy after another, they may find justification to deny him the nomination even though he will likely end the primary season with hundreds more delegates and millions more votes than second-place Cruz.\nPoll numbers showing him being destroyed by Democrat Hillary Clinton and scuttling the hopes of his down-ballot Republicans will just add fuel to the fire.\n\"The negatives are going to come down, the image is going to change,\" Manafort assured the Republicans gathered in Florida.\nMr Trump has to finish strong and win as many delegates as he can in the remaining primary contests, but if he falls short of 1,237 pledged delegates, as he is likely to do, this perception campaign could be decisive.\nMr Trump has his die-hard supporters. He also has an insurmountable lead in the Republican delegate count and popular vote that will make it difficult, and extremely messy, to deny him the party's nomination.\nBut what about the American people? Mr Trump's rebranding attempts will be for naught if he can't convince a wide swath of the public that views him with scepticism bordering on disdain to give him another chance.\nThe current outlook is gloomy. In the latest NBC News poll, 65% of respondents had a negative view of the Republican front-runner versus only 24% who saw him positively. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, had a 56-32 negative-to-positive split.\nManafort, however, explained that the Democrat's negatives were more durable than those of his candidate.\n\"Fixing personality negatives is a lot easier than fixing character negatives,\" he said. \"You can't change somebody's character. But you can change the way somebody presents themselves.\"\nIt's a tall mountain to climb, but one the Mr Trump has surmounted once already. When he first announced his candidacy, the New Yorker's prospects were roundly dismissed because of high negatives within his own party. In past presidential contests, no candidate - particularly one as well-known as Mr Trump - had been able turn around such ratings and find electoral success.\nHistory, it turned out, was a lousy guide. In a few months Mr Trump was finding support across a wide swath of the Republican Party - moderates and ultra-conservatives, evangelicals and Tea Party seculars.\nIt was an unprecedented transformation.\nNow Mr Trump and his team are seeking another transformation. It seems far-fetched, but campaigns aren't conducted in a vacuum. He doesn't have to be great. He doesn't have to be adored. He just has to get more votes than his Democratic opponent.\nAnd Donald Trump is now taking steps to tone down the rhetoric and put himself in a position to make that happen.", "summary": "On Thursday the Great Trump Pivot went from pundit speculation and political tea-leaf reading to official campaign strategy.", "id": "36031379", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

The North Sea will recover.\n\"I'm prepared to guarantee in the next four or five years we won't perhaps be back to where we were but we will be back to a pretty active, strong industry with a lot of prospects ahead of it.\"\nThere are pleasant surprises for Britain's oil and gas industry from its annual activity survey.\n1 Output increased by nearly 10% last year - far more than expected, and after steep declines in recent years. It's expected to rise another 2.3% this year.\n2 More than half of exploration wells were successful in 2015 - the best hit rate for 10 years, and with bigger finds than in the previous three years.\n3 Cost-cutting was ahead of plan. Whereas falling production and 10% annual inflation for four years had driven up the cost per barrel extracted, the reverse was true with rising production and a sharp cut in industry pricing.\nFor instance, the cost of the average exploration well fell from \u00a344m to \u00a330m in only one year.\nThe average cost of producing a barrel of oil from British waters is on track to fall by 42% in only two years.\nThere. That upbeat list didn't take long.

They describe the conditions there as \"pathetic\" and \"oppressive\".\n\"I came to Qatar from Kenya last June to work on the construction sites here.\nI got the work through an agency. I was paid $350 (\u00c2\u00a3223) a month when I got here, which was a lot less than I was promised. I also spent a lot to get here - over $1,000.\nI worked at sites building government schools near [the capital] Doha from June to November last year. There are a lot of infrastructure projects going on here, alongside the World Cup venues.\nThe main site that I worked on was not a good environment. The majority of the workers are uneducated, and the companies take advantage of them, so they cannot negotiate.\nThey just become helpers and are badly paid. Many just end up accepting it, as they cannot go back to their home countries, because they are supporting their families.\nI am sending money back to my family. They are all looking to me, but I can't tell them what it is like here, or they would tell me to come home.\nWhen I arrived, I was told that I would be working as an electrician, even though I am not trained, which is dangerous. I got an electric shock on the site once, but thankfully I was OK.\nConditions on the sites are very bad. You work all day out in the open in extreme heat. You start at 04:00 and work all day. There is no cold drinking water on the site, just hot water. It is very oppressive.\nNo-one will listen if you complain. We once went on strike because we weren't paid for a month. We were eventually paid, but the management didn't care about our complaints.\nLife in Qatar is very expensive. The accommodation is provided through the company, but food and general living expenses make it hard to save anything. I try to send home what I can.\nAs for the accommodation, I would describe the conditions as pathetic. In the first place I stayed, Al Khor, there were 10 people to one small room, with five bunk beds and nowhere to put anything. The toilets were outside. It was all very inadequate and uncomfortable.\nYou also have to hand over your passport on arrival, so you can't leave. You feel trapped, like a prisoner.\nI am now staying in a place called Industrial - where most of the migrant workers live. The hygiene here is very poor.\nThere are five to a room, which is a bit better, but it is not hygienic. I now work in a mall in sales after being allowed to leave my job at the construction sites. It is a bit better, but still not great.\nLife is very hard here. I would like to see the lives of migrant workers here change. It's just a sacrifice now. There need to be improvements made to safety, salaries and accommodation.\"\n\"I am a truck driver working on the site of a new port project near Doha. I came here from Ghana a year and a half ago.\nHonestly speaking, we are suffering badly at the hands of our employers, especially in the summer time, as it is now.\nIt is 40-50C here during the day, but there is no air conditioning in our vehicles, and we are breathing sandy air. At times the dust and sand flows in the air like snow.\nThere is nobody to fight for us. For almost two months now, my company has refused to pay our salaries. Our company is killing us because they don't want to give us the little reward we deserve.\nMy salary of $550 a month is very low for a driver like me.  We have no days off to rest. This not only applies to me - it is the same with every worker at my company.\nI start at 05:00 and work until 19:00, with two hours of transportation to the site and back each day.\nQatar has a labour office, but if you report your company, they will definitely send you back to your country. So everyone is too scared to report any problems.\nI'm an orphan from a poor home. I couldn't finish my secondary school education.\nI have been living in cabins in camps, separated by plywood. Almost all of the workers staying in these camps, are poor and come from countries in Africa and Asia, like Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. We all experience the same problems.\nAbout 15-20% of the workers here have achieved some quality of living standard, with a good salary, due to their educational background, or they have been able to get work through good foreign companies.\nBut for the rest of us, the payment of salaries is a real headache.\nHow I wish I could save enough money to leave here to get to Europe or the US.\nThat's my ambition, because in Ghana, even graduates don't have work, so imagine how hard it is for people like me who had to drop out of school.\"\n\"I worked on one of the World Cup sites in Doha at the end of March. I left after two weeks, because the conditions were an absolute disgrace.\nI work as a pipe fitter and supervisor and have been on construction sites all over the world. These were the worst conditions I've ever seen on any site.\nMost of the workers at the site where I worked were Indian. They are treated very badly, and the conditions in which they live and work are terrible.\nThere is no drinking water available, there is no air conditioning in their cabins - and this was in 45C heat. They have filthy sanitation, and the food is dished out like in the Oliver Twist movie.\nHowever, what's even worse is the on-site safety, or lack of it.

Now, though they are heading into the final two rounds still with a chance of lifting the title and completing a clean sweep of the home nations.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSecondly, was the manner in which they won.\nIt was not a nail-biting finish. Instead there were choruses of Flower of Scotland rolling around Murrayfield in the final 10 minutes, as the home team went away with the match.\nThey scored 20 unanswered points in the second half. In any hemisphere, at any level, that is a phenomenal performance.\nThe forwards made up for the loss of the injured Josh Strauss' heavy-duty ball carrying though sheer industry though.\nJohn Barclay led through deed as captain and Hamish Watson was an absolute bundle of energy, while Huw Jones was elusive and quick in the centres, keeping the Wales midfield honest and allowing the wings space to score their tries.\nAnd Stuart Hogg stood out once again.\nHe has superb acceleration, an eye for the gap and then the top-end speed to exploit it.\nBut against Wales it was his game-awareness - the ability to invariably do the right thing - that was key.\nFor Tommy Seymour's try he recognised that Huw Jones run had drawn the attention of the Wales defence and should be used as a decoy.\nFor Tim Visser's, he realised that George North was coming up fast and that he had to get that pass across his body as fast as possible.\nAfter that win, talk inevitably turned to the Calcutta Cup match against England in a fortnight's time.\nTheir best chance of attacking England is out wide. The catch is that they can't go there immediately.\nYou have to keep the opposition defence narrow with big runners or decoy angles to create the space.\nScotland have to put together a more complete performance than they have managed yet in the tournament.\nThey have to play as well as they did in the first half against Ireland across a whole match. If not, they won't win.\nThis was an incredibly disappointing weekend for Wales.\nTheir performance was wonderful against England a fortnight ago, even if the result was not what they wanted.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut they backed it up with very little at Murrayfield.\nBy interim coach Rob Howley's own admission their title hopes have gone.\nHis selection for the next round against Ireland will show whether he is prioritising World Cups or saving face.\nFly-half Sam Davies came on as a replacement and is the sort of player who suits an adventurous, ambitious style.\nBut six minutes before he arrived on the pitch, Jamie Roberts had come on in the centres.\nRoberts brings great experience and can dominate the gainline and guarantee quick ball.\nBut he is not the player to help Davies spread the ball wide.\nWe don't know if Davies could work alongside the starting midfield of Jonathan Davies and Scott Williams.\nNow is the time to drop Dan Biggar and find out.\nItaly's tactics - not engaging at the breakdown, not providing England with an offside line to work with and putting players into the channel between Danny Care and his runners - were really well thought out and executed.\nEngland spent the first half flummoxed.\nHowever if Conor O'Shea's side had tried it against New Zealand, the All Blacks still would have sussed it out straight away.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFirstly because it is a tactic that their provincial Chiefs side have employed in Super Rugby, but secondly because their on-the-field problem-solving and mental agility is what sets them apart from the rest of world rugby.\nA better team than England would have adapted to it a lot quicker and I think England were embarrassed by the fact that it took until the second half for them to sort it out.\nWe didn't get a look at what impact coach Eddie Jones' changes had.\nHe brought Ben Te'o into the centres, gave Danny Care a chance to start at scrum half, but they never really got a chance to implement the patterns that they had been running in training.\nThere were plus points. James Haskell was strong and industrious from his open-side flanker berth. Elliot Daly always seems to have time on the ball and that is a quality that sets good players apart. Second rows Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes were outstanding in their workrate.\nBut there were concerns as well.\nOwen Farrell had an uncharacteristically poor game by his standards and Ireland and Scotland will have earmarked George Ford's fly-half channel as a potential weakness.\nAfter France attacked him and made metres in round two and Michele Campagnaro ran through him for Italy's second try at Twickenham.\nHowever getting heavy traffic through on collision course with Ford, with James Haskell patrolling a similar area, is harder in reality than in theory.\nAs tight and competitive as this Test was, it was a defensive struggle that was not easy on the eye.\nFrance seemed to have more power, but lacked the collective team cohesion that Ireland have built over a number of years under Joe Schmidt.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIreland did what was required to win and France, for all their power, never really threatened to wrestle the game from them.\nWhat Schmidt will have been disappointed by is that Ireland should have made it easier.\nThey had a few multi-phase passages of play near the France line which they failed to convert into scores. Good teams make those count.\nThat is a big coaching challenge of modern rugby.\nIt can become so frenetic and hectic. Nobody seems to be able to take the game by the scruff of the neck, have the clarity of thought to see where the opportunity is and have the skills to seize it.\nCentre Garry Ringrose looked promising again, making a few half breaks and cutting back against the drift defence.\nI would like to see him in a game and a backline with more fluency though to assess his ability to straighten though a hole and turn half-breaks into full ones.\nThis is my third-round Lions XV, based on the form shown over the weekend.\nJeremy Guscott was speaking to BBC Sport's Mike Henson.", "summary": "Just when you think you have the Six Nations pegged, it confounds expectations once again.", "id": "39099083", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nJeremy Guscott was speaking to BBC Sport's Mike Henson.

Some fear traditional fishing methods may die out altogether.\nIn an office overlooking the factory floor of Visir Fisheries in Grindavik in south-western Iceland, computer-generated images of cod fillets glide across a computer screen.\nThis is one of the most advanced fish processing factories in the world. The workers tend to a machine that sizes up each fish and slices it with a laser-accurate water jet. It can produce one perfectly shaped fillet each second.\nManager Johann Helgason points at one of the pale shapes passing by on his screen. \"That's a pin bone.\" The robot will make sure it goes back for the tiny offender - just a few millimetres long - to be removed.\n\"The standardisation of the portions is more or less perfect,\" Mr Helgason says. \"It maximises the value of each single piece that goes through.\"\nMany of these flawless fillets will end up being eaten in the UK. Iceland's biggest market is Europe and inside the EU the largest market is Britain.\nAll parts of the fish are used. \"Our goal is to increase the value of those by-products,\" says Mr Helgason. \"We are using biotechnology to try to find materials in the fish skin or the eye, or the head - like enzymes or collagen. We want to go more into pharmaceutical or food supplements.\"\nThis \u00c2\u00a330m factory is at the cutting-edge of fish processing. Would they be in this position if Iceland were within the EU? Mr Helgason is sceptical.\n\"We have full control of the industry here in Iceland. We decide the catch and the rules. This makes us very quick to react if something needs to change, which is why we are very competitive.\"\nIceland forms part of the European Economic Area along with Norway and Lichtenstein. They get market access for fewer obligations: Iceland has to take in 15-20% of EU rules into its own legal framework.\nMr Helgason does not feel that Visir would gain much from being in Europe. \"We are completely independent. It's up to us who we want to deal with and what kind of relationship we have with each country. This gives us an advantage.\"\nThe fishing industry is based on a quota system.\nTo keep fish stocks sustainable and protect the marine ecosystem, scientists from the Icelandic Marine Research Institute continually monitor Icelandic waters and provide this data to the government.\nThis guidance is followed to help set limits on the amount of fish that can be caught.\nAs under the Common Fisheries Policy, this quota can be bought and sold.\nThe Fisheries Ministry is the most powerful department in the Icelandic government. Dressed in an impeccable suit Minister Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson sits at a polished circular table in his office overlooking Reykjavik harbour.\nHe is blunt.\n\"I would never join the European Union,\" he says. \"There is a life outside it, as we have proven. We have one of the biggest and one of the strongest fisheries in the world that is sustainable without any subsidies from the state.\n\"We don't have to share this decision-making with anyone else. It would be difficult for Icelanders to control their economic and fisheries sector having the obligation to discuss it with 27 or 28 other countries.\"\nThe 10 biggest families in Iceland control 50-60% of the quota.\nGunnar Tomasson is director of another fishing giant: Thorfish. He stands on the harbour wall watching 25,000 tonnes of fish being unloaded from one of his ships after a five day-trip.\n\"Today the fishing stocks are sustainable and we are controlling them very well. But inside the European Union, it is totally the other way around. They are not controlling it; they are overfishing their stocks and they are even paying subsidies to their industry. We do not want to go into the European Union.\"\nHowever, the fact that Iceland is in charge of its own fish stocks does not mean that all fishermen are happy with the system.\nThere is criticism of the centralisation of power: the fact that a large company can own a factory, own a vessel and also own the quota.\nOne industry insider who did not want to be named likens this to a \"mafia\".\nSince 1984, the number of people working in the industry has gone down by half. Smaller boats are struggling - just as they are in the UK.\nIn Sandgerdi, Halldor Armannsson and his 80-year-old father heave a tub of frozen mackerel and squid from an ancient freezer hut across a cracked patio and into a rundown shed. The bait is hacked up and pressed down on hooks attached to long lines that will run behind their boat.\nThis family has been fishing these Arctic waters in this way for 400 years. Currently, their business supports five families.\nMr Armannsson could be better protected under European rules. Reforms to the Common Fisheries policy mean these businesses - with their sustainable fishing methods - should be prioritised when quota is handed out.\nMr Armannsson says: \"The small fishermen are dying out. Three years ago, we had about 600 boats line- and hook-fishing. Now, we have just 200. The bigger boats buy the quota and once it is lost they can't get it back. The smaller fleet just can't compete.\"\nHe says that people have to move to where the large fish factories are and so fishing in the smaller Icelandic villages is dying out.\n\"The control of the fisheries is what I am afraid of.

In the aftermath one man lies dead and another badly injured.\nFurther down the street, four security cameras outside a local resident's home picked up the sound of the exchange of fire between the two men, but no images of what happened.\nEyewitnesses reported seeing the pair standing just a few metres apart firing handguns at each other, but it is unclear which of the two perpetrators shot first.\nIn an attempt to unravel what happened, local police called Robert Maher, a professor in electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University.\nUsing audio captured by the microphones on the security cameras, he was able to reconstruct the incident shot-by-shot to reveal where each of the men were standing and who fired first.\nProf Maher is one of a small group of acoustics experts working to establish a new field of forensics that examines the sound of gunshots recorded on camera footage or by phones.\n\"Nowadays it is not uncommon for someone with a cell phone to be making a video at the time of a gunfire incident,\" he explains. \"The most common types of recordings are from dashboard cameras or vest-mounted cameras carried by law enforcement officers.\n\"Also common are recordings from an emergency telephone call centres where the calls are being recorded and the caller's phone picks up a gunshot sound.  In some cases there are private surveillance systems at homes and businesses that include audio recordings.\"\nGunshots make a distinctive sound that makes them easy to distinguish from other commonly mistaken noises such as a car backfiring or fireworks.\nA firearm produces an abrupt blast of intense noise from the muzzle that lasts just one or two millionths of a second before disappearing again. High-powered rifles also produce an additional sonic boom as the bullet passes through the sound barrier before the sound of the muzzle blast is detected.\nMost of us spend our lives surrounded by devices capable of capturing these sounds inadvertently if a crime occurs nearby. Professor Maher's aim is to extract details from these recordings that might help police piece together a crime.\nTogether with his colleagues, he has been compiling a database of firearm sounds in a project funded by US National Institute of Justice. They are firing an array of rifles, shotguns, semiautomatic pistols and revolvers beside an array of 12 microphones arranged in a semicircle.\nEach of the guns appear broadly similar to human ears when fired on an open range, but using software to analyse the sound waves picked up by the microphones, they have found it is possible to distinguish different types of weapon.\n\"We observe differences between pistols with differing calibre and barrel length for example,\" says Professor Maher. \"Revolvers differ from pistols because sound can emanate from the gap between the revolver cylinder and the gun barrel, causing two sound sources that can be detected at certain angles.\"\nHis analysis has also revealed other details can be gleaned from recordings of gunfire.\nThe shape of the sound wave produced by a gunshot, for example, is different depending on which way the weapon is pointing. If the microphone is off to one side of the shooter, the split second burst of noise can different compared to when it is in front of or behind the gun.\nThey have also found it is possible to pick up distinct echoes as the initial sound produced by a gunshot reverberates off nearby buildings, parked cars, trees and walls. After the initial blast, other smaller blips in the sound wave can be seen within a fraction of a second of the shot.\nBy calculating the time it takes for sound to travel to and from an obstacle, it is possible to calculate how far a shooter was away from it. It can even reveal if a shooter was firing from an elevated position from the muzzle blast reflecting off the ground.\n\"This means the orientation and location of shooters in some circumstances can be determined,\" according to Prof Maher, who revealed some of his findings to a symposium organised by the National Institute of Justice in New Orleans last month.\n\"In situations where more than one recording of the shooting scene is available, such as where two or more patrol cars equipped with dashboard audio or video recorders are present at an incident, the position of the vehicles can sometimes help triangulate the sounds.\"\nIt is a similar concept to the one used by companies like Raytheon, which produces sniper locators for the military that use the sound of a gunshot to locate the shooter. An array of microphones can be mounted on buildings, vehicles or helicopters to help spot shots.\nAnother firm, Shotspotter, uses a network of microphones across 90 cities in the US to help law enforcement detect gunshots.\nThe difference with these systems is that they detect gunfire in real time, while Professor Maher is trying piece together what happened days, weeks and even months after a shooting.\nIn the case described at the start of this article - a real shooting that occurred recently in Cincinnati, Ohio - the injured man claimed he had shot the other man dead in self defence after he was fired at first.\nWith the two gunshots occurring less than a second apart, it was impossible for witnesses to definitely say which of the shooters had fired first.\nUsing the security camera recordings of a local home owner living further down the street, however, Professor Maher was able to reveal two distinct gunshots in the audio.\nJust a few milliseconds after the first gunshot, a distinct second blip appeared in the sound wave, just moments before the second shot was fired.\nThis blip was the echo of the first gunshot bouncing off a large building at a T-junction around 90 metres to the north. The echo from the second gunshot was far harder to spot in the sound-waves produced.\nAccording to Professor Maher, this suggests the first shooter to fire their gun was the one pointing it to the north - the same man who claimed he had been firing in self-defence.\nProfessor Maher hopes the growing amount of technology capable of recording audio will make such analysis even easier in the future. The microphones on many older consumer devices are not designed to handle the abrupt, loud sounds of gunshots and it can overload them\nBut as more homes become equipped with home security cameras and \"always-on\" smart assistants like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, it may be possible to capture better audio of events.\nIt is something that other forensics experts believe could have a growing role in the future.\nMike Brookes, a reader in communications and signal processing at Imperial College London, said: \"\"The sort of question that such recordings can help with are in sorting out the timing and sequence of events that took place and in establishing the position from which a gun was fired.\"", "summary": "Pioneering work to extract detailed information from audio recordings of gunshots could give forensic case officers new avenues for solving murder cases.", "id": "39621766", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n\"The hustle and bustle of a city going about its business is broken by the crack of gunshots, sending bystanders running and screaming.

However, recent years have seen the emergence of criminal gangs who have moved in to take over drug-trafficking operations previously run by the paramilitaries.\nThe Colombian government says these criminal bands, which it calls \"Bacrims\", are now a major threat.\nThe Farc is the oldest and largest group among Colombia's left-wing rebels and is one of the world's richest guerrilla armies.\nThe group was founded in 1964, when it declared its intention to overthrow the government and install a Marxist regime.\nBut tactics changed in the 1990s, as right-wing paramilitary forces attacked the rebels, and the Farc became increasingly involved in the drug trade to raise money for its campaign.\nPresident Alvaro Uribe, who swept to power in 2002 vowing to defeat the rebels and was re-elected in 2006, launched an unprecedented offensive against the Farc, backed by US military aid.\nThe group had about 16,000 fighters in 2001, according to the Colombian government, but this is believed to have dropped to about 8,000, mainly as a result of desertions.\nThe Farc, which is on US and European lists of terrorist organisations, has suffered a series of blows in recent years.\nThe most dramatic setback was the rescue by the military of 15 high-profile hostages, including the former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt in 2008. The hostages had long been seen as a key element in the rebels' attempts to exchange their captives for jailed guerrillas.\nThe group's founder and long-time leader, Manuel \"Sureshot\" Marulanda, died that same year of a heart attack.\nOn 23 September 2010, the group's top military leader, Jorge Briceno, also known as Mono Jojoy, was killed in a raid on his jungle camp in the eastern region of Macarena.\nIn November 2011, Alfonso Cano, leader of the group since Marulanda's death, was killed in a bombing and ground raid in Cauca province. He was replaced by Rodrigo Londono, better known under his alias of Timochenko.\nThe rebels still control rural areas, particularly in the south and east, where the presence of the state is weak, and have stepped up hit-and-run attacks in recent months\nHowever, in what was interpreted by analysts as a major concession, the Farc announced in February 2012 that it was abandoning kidnapping for ransom.\nIn November 2012, the Farc and the government opened peace talks, focussing on six key issues: land reform, political participation, disarmament of the rebels, drug trafficking, the rights of victims, and the implementation of the peace deal.\nThe left-wing group was formed in 1964 by intellectuals inspired by the Cuban revolution and Marxist ideology.\nIt was long seen as more politically motivated than the Farc, staying out of the illegal drugs trade on ideological grounds.\nThe ELN reached the height of its power in the late 1990s, carrying out hundreds of kidnappings and hitting infrastructure such as oil pipelines.\nThe ELN ranks have since declined from around 4,000 to an estimated 1,500 to 2,000, suffering defeats at the hands of the security forces and paramilitaries.\nHowever, in October 2009, ELN rebels were able to spring one of their leaders from jail, indicating that they were not a completely spent force.\nIn recent years ELN units have become involved in the drugs trade, often forming alliance with criminal gangs.\nThe group is on US and European lists of terrorist organisations.\nShortly after the Farc entered into peace talks with the Colombian government in November 2012, the ELN leader said that his group was also interested in negotiating a deal with the government.\nThe group was rebuffed by the president, who said it needed to show actions rather than words before it could sit down at the negotiating table.\nNine months later, after the release of a Canadian mining executive the ELN had been holding, President Juan Manual Santos said the government \"was ready to talk\" to the ELN.\nHe said he hoped negotiations could start \"as soon as possible\".  So far, no more details about the framework of the planned talks have been released.\nThis right-wing umbrella group was formed in 1997 by drug-traffickers and landowners to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion.\nThe AUC had its roots in the paramilitary armies built up by drug lords in the 1980s, and says it took up arms in self-defence, in the place of a powerless state.\nCritics denounced it as little more than a drugs cartel.\nThe AUC's influence stemmed from its links with the army and some political circles, and its strength was boosted by financing from business interests and landowners.\nThe group carried out massacres and assassinations, targeting left-wing activists who speak out against them.\nIn 2003, a peace deal was signed with the AUC, under which paramilitary leaders surrendered in exchange for reduced jail terms and protection from extradition.\nHowever, the Colombian authorities have extradited more than a dozen former paramilitary leaders to the US to face drug trafficking charges since 2008, saying they had violated the terms of the peace deal.\nSome 32,000 paramilitary fighters have been demobilised, but the legal framework underpinning the process has been widely criticised for allowing those responsible for serious crimes to escape punishment.\nThe Colombian government regards the \"Bacrims\", as it refers to criminal bands, as the new enemy and the biggest threat to security.\nThe gangs, who include former paramilitary fighters, are involved in drug-trafficking and extortion.\nIn September 2010, a local think-tank, Indepaz, said a dozen or so new narco-paramilitary groups had quickly replaced the AUC in much of Colombia and were now responsible for more violence than left-wing rebels.\nThis echoes an earlier report in 2007 by the International Crisis Group, which highlighted concerns that former paramilitaries were joining forces with drug-trafficking organisations.\nWith names like the Black Eagles, Erpac and Rastrojos, they combine control of cocaine production and smuggling with extreme violence, but do not have any apparent political agenda.\nThe authorities believe in some regions they have joined forces with left-wing rebels to run drug-trafficking operations, while in other areas the new gangs and the guerrillas have clashed.", "summary": "Colombia's civil conflict has lasted more than five decades, drawing in left-wing rebels and right-wing paramilitaries.", "id": "11400950", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Colombian government says these criminal bands, which it calls \"Bacrims\", are now a major threat.\nThe Farc is the oldest and largest group among Colombia's left-wing rebels and is one of the world's richest guerrilla armies.

But it was a genuine possibility in the hours before the 13 July bailout deal was hammered out. Since then, Greece has successfully negotiated the first hurdles put up by its eurozone partners.\nThe most important obstacle was in the Greek parliament, where the Syriza-led government survived a rebellion and pushed through tough reforms on VAT, pensions and early retirement which eurozone partners said were an immediate test for the government to pass.\nThat triggered a deal on \u20ac7.16bn in emergency funding, to enable the government to pay its arrears with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its July bill from the European Central Bank (ECB).\nSignificantly, it has also prompted the ECB to lift its limit on emergency cash assistance for Greek banks, which reopen on 20 July, three weeks after they were shut.\nNot for a while, and it depends on weeks of negotiations on the terms of the third bailout.\nCapital controls, imposed when the ECB froze emergency liquidity assistance for the banks (ELA), are unlikely to be lifted for some time. So while the banks are open again, cash withdrawals will be limited to \u20ac420 per week.\nThe reality is that Greece has not been normal for several years. The financial crisis hit Greece and its banks hard. The jobless rate is above 25% and youth unemployment is as high as 50%.\nWhat are capital controls?\nIf negotiations fall through, Greece could still leave the single currency.\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he was unhappy with the bailout deal he negotiated with other eurozone leaders but he was faced with a clear choice: \"A deal we largely disagreed with, or a chaotic default.\"\nSo there is a chance a government that does not believe in a bailout deal and that relied on opposition MPs to get it past parliament might not last to see it through.\nThere are plenty of politicians and economists who believe Greece should leave the euro, most notably German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who believes Greece needs debt relief, which is not seen as legal within the single currency.\nBut at a European level, politically the decision appears to have been taken to do whatever it takes to keep Greece in. And for now Mr Schaeuble's arguments have been over-ruled.\nAustria's centre-left Chancellor Werner Faymann has said it would be \"totally wrong\" for Greece to leave, and ECB Chairman Mario Draghi has been even clearer. The ECB's mandate was, he said, \"to act based on the assumption that Greece is and will be a member of the euro area\".\nThis was an idea put forward by Mr Schaeuble, who called for a Greek \"time-out from the euro area\", enabling the Athens government to restructure its debts.\nHe and many others believe Greek debt is unsustainable and that a debt write-off - a \"haircut\" - would make more sense outside the euro as it is not allowed inside it.\nA time-out was discussed by eurozone leaders, but the terms of re-entering the eurozone are so stringent that a time-out would in reality have become permanent. For France's President Hollande, there is \"no such thing as temporary Grexit\".\nSchaeuble - man with a Grexit plan\nCertainly, there is a clear attraction for many Greeks of abandoning the euro, when faced with many more years of eurozone austerity and a new debt burden of \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn).\nBut it all depends on whether or not Greece is allowed to restructure its debts.\nThe International Monetary Fund revealed it had warned eurozone leaders that Greece's debt would peak at 200% of GDP, far higher than previous estimates. Its \"dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability\" required debt relief \"on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date\".\nThe only reference to potential debt relief in the eurozone deal is of \"possible longer grace and payment periods\". And Germany's Angela Merkel said there was a plan to consider restructuring later in the year, after the \"first review\" of the bailout.\nThe European Commission said \"a very substantial debt re-profiling\" was possible if Greece kept to agreed reforms. However a debt write-off was not on the cards.\nGreece's former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis certainly believes it will not happen.\nWould Grexit have been a better deal?\nThere is no precedent for a country to leave the euro and no-one knows how it might happen.\nHowever, Yanis Varoufakis gave an illuminating idea of the initial steps he had planned for Greece to take towards Grexit in preparation for when the ECB cut off emergency funding for Greek banks.\nHis colleagues rejected the plan.\nThe problem for Greece is the damage already done to the banks. Tens of billions of euros have already been withdrawn from private and business accounts, and capital controls have left Greeks unable to withdraw large sums of cash.\nThe risk is that a messy default could cause even more harm to the Greek economy.\nGreece would suffer instant devaluation and inflation. It could end up a pariah in the international markets for years, much like Argentina in 2002.\nTourism - one of Greece's main earners - would be hit hard, dealing a hammer blow to an ailing economy.\nSome economists believe a return to the drachma could eventually benefit the economy, but it is difficult to see anything positive in the short term.\nIf Greece were to fall out of the euro, one potential option for the banks would be to reopen with a parallel currency before the revival of Greece's former currency, the drachma.\nAnother would be to place Greece in a type of eurozone quarantine, where it would use the euro but not be a fully-fledged part of it. After all, Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro without being inside the eurozone. This method could also be used if Greece were to leave the eurozone on a temporary basis.\nGreece could also maintain two euro currencies, with the euro used for transactions and the government paying salaries and pensions in a separate Greek-style euro or even in IOUs.\nHow easy is it to swap currencies?\n\u20ac320bn\nGreece's debt mountain\n\u20ac240bn\nEuropean bailout\n177% country's

to discover the highest-ranked albums of the year.\nRead about the top 10, and what the critics had to say about each of them, below.\nAs a teenager, you're often told the torrent of emotional ups and downs is \"just hormones\" and once puberty ends, life will sort itself out. But what if that's not true?\nOn her fourth album, 26-year-old indie-pop artist Mitski Miyawaki confronts that head on - exploring her anxiety, depression, happiness and everything in between. The songs mirror her turmoil, veering from the hushed sincerity of Once More To See You to the squalling punk of My Body's Made of Crushed Little Stars.\nA darling of America's lo-fi folk-rock scene, Missouri-born Angel Olsen got playful on her fourth album. Inspired by David Bowie, she experimented with different styles, new singing voices and, in the video for Intern, a bright silver tinsel wig.\nThe record is divided into two halves - an upbeat, pop-infused \"side A\", followed by a more introspective B-side, hinged around the cathartic, seven-minute fuzz-rock ballad Woman, in which she sings: \"I dare you to understand/What makes me a woman.\"\nRadiohead rekindled their relationship with melody on their ninth album, the beautiful and serene A Moon Shaped Pool.\nThom Yorke's break-up from his long-term partner Rachel Owen (who sadly died this week) pervades the album, adding a layer of melancholy to many of the songs - not least the closing track, True Love Waits, written at the start of their relationship in 1995 but uncompleted until this year.\nRecorded in secret before rapper Phife Dawg's death from diabetes in March, A Tribe Called Quest's first album in 18 years was an unexpected return to form.\nLead single We The People addresses the rise in right-wing supremacism (\"Muslims and gays?/Boy, we hate your ways,\" raps Q-Tip sardonically), while the Musical Youth-sampling Dis Generation is a salute to the rappers inspired by the Tribe's brand of socially-conscious hip-hop.\nHyperactive, ambitious and never truly finished, The Life Of Pablo gave an unprecedented glimpse into Kanye West's creative process - not to mention the psyche of the \"38-year-old eight year old\".\nInitially available as a streaming exclusive on Tidal, it was tweaked and updated several times, and while much of it remains infuriatingly unfocused, West's lack of respect for musical boundaries makes for a compelling listen.\nA year ago, Solange Knowles published an essay detailing the prejudice and hostility she has encountered in schools, airports and concert venues, simply for being a black woman.\nIt prompted a year of musical soul searching, in which she moved to Louisiana (where her grandparents lived until a Molotov cocktail was thrown into their home) and recorded a graceful, restrained album that addresses segregation, reverse racism, police brutality, cultural theft and black pride.\nInspired by the birth of his son and brimming with gospel influences, Chance The Rapper's third album effortlessly shakes off the self-obsessed nihilism of modern hip-hop for something altogether more joyful.\nLyrically sharp and fiercely independent, the Chicago-born musician shunned major label deals to release the album as a streaming exclusive on Apple Music. It duly became the first record to top the US charts without ever being sold.\nWith all the punctuality of Southern Trains, Frank Ocean's second album arrived four years late, one morning in August. It was worth the wait.\nHazy and meandering, its 17 tracks glide in and out of focus like a fever dream, as Ocean ponders on love, loss and reality itself. Difficult to digest at first, it rewards the repeat listener with richly-detailed sonic secrets.\nDavid Bowie's death in January was all the more shocking because he sounded so creatively invigorated on Blackstar.\nRetrospectively recognised as his \"parting gift\", it finds the star coming to terms with his own mortality (the title itself implies a light flickering out) while the music, recorded with a New York jazz band, suggests a journey into the unknown.\nFrom the moment she performed at the Super Bowl dressed in Black Panther gear, it was clear Beyonce had something to get off her chest.\nTwo months later, she let us have it - a fierce, densely-layered album that uses Jay Z's (alleged) infidelity as the framing device for a meditation on black history, female identity, betrayal, resilience and redemption.\nSumptuously produced, the record also sees Beyonce spread her musical wings: she flaunts her Texas roots on the country ballad Daddy Lessons; while the Jack White-assisted Don't Hurt Yourself has been nominated for best rock performance at next year's Grammys.\nBut more than that, Lemonade is a window into the soul of a performer who has often seemed remote and untouchable.

But how common are child abductions?\nThe charity Action Against Abduction, formerly Pact, estimates that roughly 50 children under the age of 16 are abducted by strangers every year.\nIts report Taken, which used data from UK police forces in 2011-12, found that 42% of all abduction attempts were made by strangers - and three quarters of the attempts were unsuccessful.\nThe average age of abducted children in the UK was 13, while the average age of children who suffered attempted abductions by non-parental perpetrators was 11, according to the report.\nAction Against Abduction claims that most of these cases are sexually motivated, yet many attempted abductions are not reported to police.\nHowever, offences by strangers are still quite rare - with the NSPCC pointing out that more than 90% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone known to the child.\nGeoff Newiss, chief executive of Action Against Abduction, said the \"old fashioned scenario\" of a man luring a young girl into a car has not changed all that much.\nThe charity's report found that in 2011-12, three quarters of stranger abductions involved girls and more than two-thirds of stranger abductions involved a perpetrator in a car.\nHowever, he said: \"People tend to think of the very worst case scenarios - the Sarah Payne case or April Jones. They tend to think about murder. But there are a very small number of homicides\".\nBoth eight-year-old Sarah Payne and five-year-old April Jones were abducted and killed by paedophiles in 2000 and 2012 respectively.\nMr Newiss pointed to the \"varying degrees\" in severity of abductions, and of stranger-related offences.\nHe said: \"Most are, or believed to be, sexual exploitation\", but he said that the majority involve indecent exposure, touching or fondling.\nA 2008 study by the University of Huddersfield found that 41% of stranger-perpetrated sexual abuse and abduction cases involved indecent exposure, 26% touching and 23% abduction.\nThe study, which was based on a questionnaire completed by 2,420 children in the north-west England, found that nine out of 10 reported abductions were attempted and not completed.\nLatest figures from the NSPCC's Childline helpline show that the internet is increasingly being used as a gateway for offenders to commit crimes including sexual assaults, sexual exploitation and grooming.\nChildline sessions related to grooming have risen by 21% in the last year, it said.\nAcross the board, the number of child sex offences reported to the police throughout the UK rose to a record 45,456 last year, according to the NSPCC.\nFollowing the abduction of the Oxfordshire schoolgirl on Wednesday, an NSPCC spokesman said: \"This has been a horrific experience for the girl and her family and parents in the area will understandably be very worried, but thankfully random abductions of children are relatively rare.\n\"It's essential that the perpetrators are caught before they harm any other children and that the girl is offered whatever support she needs to recover and to give evidence if a successful prosecution is brought.\"\nThe problem is that many attempts go unreported, said Mr Newiss. Certainly, the 2008 study claimed that only 33% of incidents it recorded were reported to the police.\nHe estimates that one in every 100 children face an abduction attempt at some point in their childhood or teenage years.\n\"The police numbers are the tip of the iceberg,\" he said.\n\"It's important to tell the police about attempted abductions as there may be more than one incident in an area which is important. They can't do anything if it's not reported\".\nBrian Lightman, former general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders said while schools have \"extremely rigorous\" safety checks in place preventing strangers from entering school compounds, outside the school gates people need to be vigilant.\nMr Lightman said: \"There is a need to be vigilant - to be careful and educate your children of the dangers - but also the need to ensure that there's a balance.\n\"Remember that they [abductions] are very rare. You can closet children too much.\"\nHe advised children to walk to school in groups and for parents to always be aware of where their children are.\nBefore children head out on their own, parents or carers should think about how well their children can deal with risks - from crossing the road to being out late.\nMake sure they are happy to venture out alone and set any boundaries you have - being clear about where you don't want them to go and why.\nUse an outing together as a trial run - let them take the lead and see how they cope. Show them that they can be trusted but don't feel pressured if you think they are not ready.\nAsk yourself the following:\nSource: NSPCC\nMr Newiss said the biggest concern is that people still talk about \"stranger danger\" - the government's awareness campaign which began in 1971.\n\"This comes from the early 70s and it just doesn't work now. We want to see an end to that focus on strangers and more aware of danger in general,\" he said.\nHe said that too often children are told to do as adults say, but that they should be made aware that no adult should ask them for help, or ask them to get in a car.\n\"Children need to be told to trust their instincts more,\" he said, urging people to join the charity's Safe, Not Scared campaign as an alternative approach.\nBack in 1971, the government was responding to some horrific cases of child abduction, including the Moors murders and the Cannock Chase murders of the 1960s.\nThat year, the Home Office recorded just 33 child abductions in England and Wales. These included all types of abduction - parental, other family, known but not related and stranger - as well as completed and attempted abductions.\nIn 2014-15, according to a report by Action Against Abduction, there were 1,141 cases, including 618 non-parental abduction attempts across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, according to Action Against Abduction.\nHowever, the charity has warned against interpreting the jump since the 1970s as a real increase, explaining that police reporting processes have changed a great deal during that time.", "summary": "Police have stepped up patrols in Oxford after a teenage girl walking to school was abducted and sexually assaulted.", "id": "37504781", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child sex offences reported to the police throughout the UK rose to a record 45,456 last year, according to the NSPCC.\nThe charity said that the number of child sex offences reported to the police throughout the UK rose to a record 45,456 last year, according to the NSPCC.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child sex offences reported to the", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is \"likely to be much higher\" than the official figures suggest.\nThe charity said that the number of child abductions is \"likely to be much higher\" than the official figures suggest.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is \"likely to be much higher\" than the official figures suggest.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is \"likely", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe NSPCC said that the number of abduction attempts has increased by 10% since 2013-14, but the number of completed abductions has fallen by 11%.\nThe charity said that the number of abductions has increased by 10% since 2013-14, but the number of completed abductions has fallen by 11%.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions has not increased, but the way in which they are recorded has changed.\nThe charity said that the number of child abductions has not increased, but the way in which they are recorded has changed.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions has not increased, but the way in which they are recorded has changed.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is likely to be much higher than the official figures suggest.\nThe charity said that the number of child abductions is likely to be much higher than the official figures suggest.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is likely to be much higher than the official figures suggest.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is likely to be much higher than the official", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nSource: Action Against Abduction\nThe NSPCC said that the number of child abductions is still low compared to the number of children in the UK.\nThe charity said that the number of children abducted is still low compared to the number of children in the UK.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of children abducted is still low compared to the number of children in the UK.\nThe NSPCC said that the number of children", "decode_al_1_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe charity's chief executive, Dr.\n\"The figures are the tip of the iceberg.\n\"The vast majority of abductions are prevented by the child, the parent or the carer.\n\"The vast majority of abductions are prevented by the child, the parent or the carer.\n\"The vast majority of abductions are prevented by the child, the parent or the carer.\n\"The vast majority of abdu", "decode_al_15_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe NSPCC said that the number of children reported missing to the police has risen by 10% in the past year, with 2,679 children reported missing in 2015-16.\nThe charity said that the number of children reported missing to the police has risen by 10% in the past year, with 2,679 children reported missing in 2015-16.\nThe NS", "decode_al_15_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe charity has a \"very small number of cases\" and \"a very large number of people who are not in the public eye\".\n\"We are not saying that there are no more abductions, but we are saying that the number of abductions is very small,\" said Mr. Newiss.\n\"We are not saying that there are no more abductions, but we are saying that the number of abductions is very small.\n\"We are not", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_3": "\nIn 1971, the Home Office recorded just 33 child abductions in England and Wales.

But Mercedes will be heading their with trepidation. It is the same sort of low-grip, low-abrasion circuit as Sochi and Monaco, where Hamilton has struggled, and the teams will also be using the ultra-soft tyre, which Mercedes are struggling to make work effectively.

Mr Cameron has used tough language about Russia's actions in Ukraine before.\nEven the phrase \"ripping up the international rule book\" is not freshly minted - look back to the joint article he penned with US President Barack Obama ahead of the Nato summit in September.\nNor is it the first time he has tendered a comparison between Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine and Hitler's behaviour on the eve of World War Two.\nDowning Street tells us that it was this language the British prime minister used round the table at  EU summits this spring and summer to make the case for sanctions.\nBut this time his blunt accusations were levelled in public.\n\"Here in this building - with its history shaped by the Blitz - we shouldn't need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries in Europe bully smaller countries,\" he said to 1,000 or so guests gathered amidst the medieval finery of the Great Hall of Guildhall,  the power house of the City of London.\nSo why lash out at Russia now?\nWell in part, it seems, because of the chilling warning that came from Mikhail Gorbachev at a recent symposium in Berlin, which has - because of who he is - set nerves on edge across the continent.\n\"The world is on the brink of a new Cold War,\" said the former Soviet leader, adding: \"Some are even saying that it has already begun.\"\nAnd in part because this Guildhall speech was by way of a public rehearsal for what Mr Cameron tells us he wants to say to President Putin when he meets him face to face at the G20 summit in Brisbane this weekend.\nFor a while it was not clear the Russian president would be going to Brisbane.\nAfter all, in the wake of Western sanctions, he had been disinvited from attending - or hosting - G8 meetings.\nTony Abbott, the Australian host, had mused aloud whether it was appropriate for him to come.\nBut the G20 summit is an international gathering, convened by members who do not all share the West's antipathy for Russia's president.\nVetoing the guest list is not in the Australian prime minister's gift.\nPlus this does present an opportunity for Western leaders to eyeball Mr Putin and see whether there is any way that this Ukrainian crisis - which seems to be fast unravelling on the ground - could somehow be stopped in its tracks.\nBut don't hold your breath for peace to break out.\nAlready, apparently, there have been tetchy meetings between the Russian president and his American and Australian counterparts at this week's earlier Asia-Pacific summit in Beijing.\nAnd if Mr Cameron is anything to go by, Brisbane will deliver even more fractious face-offs to stoke tension, not tone it down.\nIn his speech in London Mr Cameron said he did not believe a new Cold War was inevitable or desirable.\nBut nor, he added, would Britain step aside from further confrontation with Russia if it did not change its course.\nSanctions on Russia, argued Mr Cameron, were having an effect - the rouble had plummeted, and capital was flowing out of the country.\nThere is no denying this - even Russian officials admit the economy is hurting.\nThis week Russia's Central Bank revised upwards its estimate for capital flight this year from an already record $90bn (\u00c2\u00a357bn) to an even more staggering $128bn.\nWhat Mr Cameron will say to Mr Putin, apparently, is that Britain is prepared to tighten the screws still more.\n\"If Russia continues on its current path, then we will keep upping the pressure,\" he said, \"And Russia's relationship with the rest of the world will be radically different in the future.\"\nNo prizes for guessing what Mr Putin, hot foot from glad-handing Asian and Latin American leaders in Beijing, will say to that - Russia has plenty of other options and other partners to turn to. It does not need the West.\nAnd do not expect the Kremlin leader to give an inch.\nLook no further than his scathing assessment of US foreign policy over the past 20 years in his recent Valdai speech, and his warning that worse relations will follow, unless the West agrees to a new partnership on Russia's terms.\nAnd just in case Western leaders did not clock that Valdai message, it was echoed in Berlin by Mikhail Gorbachev.\nIf anyone was to blame for the loss of trust that had led to the current crisis,  said Mr Gorbachev, then it was the West and particularly the US.\nThey had declared victory in the Cold War and let euphoria and triumphalism go to their heads.\nPowerful words from the last Soviet president, an international statesman for years feted in Western capitals for his part in bringing the Cold War stand-off to an end and for his fearless attacks on Mr Putin for undermining Russia's faltering democracy.\nBut these days Mr Gorbachev no longer criticises the Russian president - he echoes him instead.\nThe absence  of trust and lack of a viable compromise in this conflict is sending the two sides hurtling in opposite directions.  The rhetoric is hardening.\nIn theory Russia and the West still share common interests - in securing a nuclear deal with Iran, in containing the threat in Syria and Iraq from the ruthless fighters of Islamic State, in finding a way to stop the low level conflict in eastern Ukraine from turning into a full blown war.\nPossibly private deals could still be done.\nBut there is precious little optimism to be garnered from the public posturing offered from the podium over the past few weeks.", "summary": "It has been a tradition since the days of Winston Churchill that the prime minister's address at the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet in London is devoted to foreign policy.", "id": "30010263", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

Do you think a word is comparable with a push in the eyes of everyone?\n\"I can't say anything because the next time I speak, seriously a stadium ban, then after that, an electronic tag.\"\nLast month, Mourinho was cleared by the FA of making discriminatory comments to former club doctor Eva Carneiro.\nHe was also charged last season for claiming there was a \"campaign\" to influence referees' decisions against his Chelsea side.\nMourinho was also given a formal warning for comments before the Blues' 2-0 win at Stoke on 22 December 2014.\nChelsea entertain Aston Villa on Saturday (15:00 BST) seeking a third Premier League win in nine games after a poor start to the season.\nThe reigning champions are 16th in the table after losing four out of eight top-flight games.\nMourinho has said he will only resign if he loses the backing of the players, with club captain John Terry stating the squad remain firmly behind the manager.\nChelsea subsequently took the unusual step of reiterating their \"full support\" in a statement on the club website.\nAsked by Walker for the reasons for the bad start to the campaign, Mourinho said: \"There's an accumulation of factors which I'm not ready to discuss.\"\nJose Mourinho's \u00a350,000 sanction was the seventh time he has been fined by the FA in 10 years, with those punishments totalling \u00a3181,000.

including attacks by prisoners on staff.\nBut Mr Grayling said prison violence was \"at a lower level today than it was five years ago\".\nMr Grayling admitted to staff shortages in certain prisons and said there had been \"far too many\" suicides among inmates, but maintained the government was adapting to such issues.\n\"We've got challenges of an increased population that was not expected in the last 12 months,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nMr Grayling added: \"We're meeting those challenges, we're recruiting those staff but I'm absolutely clear - there is not a crisis in our prisons.\n\"There are pressures which we're facing but there's not a crisis.\"\nAccording the latest figures for England and Wales, there was a 2% increase in the prison population, including those on remand - to 85,509 in the 12 months to the end of June 2014.\nThe justice secretary said he wanted \"to continue to deliver a safe and appropriate prison regime in a world where budgets are much lower than they were\".\nMr Grayling said when he became justice secretary in September 2012, he had decided against \"an option of privatising a significant number of additional prisons\".\nInstead he had opted for a proposal by prison governors to identify best practice and bring down costs, keeping the estate in the public sector.\nBut the Prison Governors Association said staffing levels were too low to make this proposal work.\nChris Grayling's interview with Today is his first on the issue of prisons since a recent run of stories highlighting issues of overcrowding, violence and death in prisons, which have led to calls to improve the state of the system.\nEarlier this month, a government investigator called for more action to tackle suicide among young inmates.\nIn July, official prison ratings revealed that more than a fifth of prisons in England and Wales were \"of concern\".\nChief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick attacked the state of the system in June, claiming \"political and policy failure\" was behind dangerous overcrowding in publicly-run jails.\nAlso that month, it emerged that the government had ordered dozens of already full jails to take in more inmates because the prison population was growing faster than expected.\nThe Ministry of Justice started recruiting a reserve force of prison officers in June this year.\nJail life: 'Hot watered and sugared'\nBut the Howard League for Penal Reform reported in July that prison officer numbers in England and Wales had been cut by 30% over three years, from 27,650 officer grade staff in September 2010 to 19,325 in September 2013.\nPrison Governors Association president Eoin McLennan Murray said the fundamental problem was \"this shortage of staff where we haven't been able to recruit in the numbers that we need in order to run safe, decent regimes\".\nHe told Today that when unions advised the government that prisons should remain in the public sector there was an understanding \"we would have certain levels of staffing\".\n\"They have not yet been delivered and that is what the government have to do,\" he said.\nHe said that if, for instance, a prisoner became ill and had to be taken out of prison to get treatment it might mean closing an entire wing to provide staff to escort them.\n\"That means you could be locking up anything from 50-150 men for a period of time, it can be for several hours,\" he added.\n\"They can lose their associations during the evening, they can lose their association during the weekends. This is happening around the country.\"\nMr Grayling's comments come as an unannounced inspection of the Isis Young Offenders Institution in Thamesmead, south-east London, reported high levels of fights and assaults.\nOf these, it stated, \"more than we usually see involved weapons\".\n\"Nearly a third of prisoners felt unsafe\", it added, with many incidents in the prison - which houses 18 to 30-year-olds - involving groups attacking single inmates.\nOne former inmate at a young offenders institute, Justin Rollins, said the environment was brutalising.\n\"I realised straight away that if you don't fight... if you don't act out with some sort of extreme violence, then you're going to get basically terrorised,\" he explained.\n\"It's not a nice place for a kid to be when you're away from your family for the first time.\"\nThe report into the Isis Young Offenders Institution also found \"obvious tensions\" between staff and prisoners due to the effect of staff shortages, with inmates allowed less time outside their cells.\nDavid Murray, a recently retired prison officer with 30 years' experience, said he had seen similar issues elsewhere in the past two years.\n\"More staff are being assaulted, vulnerable prisoners are in danger of being badly hurt or killed.\n\"It's frightening to go into an establishment where young people who come from a violent background are not caring what they do to people.\"\nAnother prison officer, who works at Feltham Young Offenders Institute, said:  \"Many of the attacks are out of fear - fear that unless they act tough they will be started on themselves and now we have fewer prison officers to deal with it too,\" he told BBC News.\nFred Lunn, who was jailed for armed robbery from the age of 18 to 37, said makeshift weapons in prisons can have a \"devastating\" effect.\n\"I've seen people boil up cooking oil, I've seen people get that in their face.\"\nThe Prison Governors Association says some prison officers are afraid to intervene in case they are accused of assault.\nIn June, the chief inspector of prisons warned that, because of staff shortages, men were locked up together for 23 hours a day, causing \"huge tension\".\nNick Hardwick said extra resources were needed or the prison population had to be reduced.\nAt the time, Mr Grayling told the BBC he disagreed.\nHe said there were 1,000 spare prison places and promised 2,000 new places by April.\nAccording to MoJ figures, the proportion of prisoners held in crowded conditions in 2013/2014 fell to 22.9% of the prison population - down from 23.3% the previous year.\nIt said this was the lowest level since 2001/02.", "summary": "Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has admitted that prisons in England and Wales face problems with violence, suicides and staff shortages.", "id": "28810439", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Prison Governors Association says some prison officers are afraid to intervene in case they are accused of assault.

abduction, murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice.\nEver since his arrest, Bridger - only the 37th person to be given a whole-life tariff - stuck steadfastly to his story about not remembering where he put April's remains.\nNever before have I witnessed such a powerful silence when a jury delivers its verdict at the end of a highly emotionally-charged case.\nThe packed public gallery remained quiet as the jury of nine women and three men returned after four hours and six minutes of deliberations.\nBridger, dressed in a long-sleeved blue shirt and a tie, closed his eyes and put his head back as the forewoman prepared to read out the verdict.\nHis eyes remained closed as each of the three guilty verdicts were delivered.\nThe forewoman looked directly at him as she announced he was guilty first of abduction, then murder and finally intending to pervert the course of justice.\nApril's mother, Coral, looked tearful but both she and her husband Paul maintained a dignified silence, as they have done throughout every day of this four-and-half-week trial.\nBefore the verdict, the judge had warned the court that \"absolute silence\" was necessary.\nHe warned members of the public gallery that this was a \"stressful\" part of the trial, \"particularly for April's parents\".\nAfter the jury delivered their unanimous verdict, April's parents, supported by close family members retired to a family waiting room.\nApril's father shook hands with some supporters as he left the public gallery.\nAfter the court had been mostly cleared, prosecutors, investigating police officers and even court staff were visibly emotional.\nBut shortly after he was convicted it emerged that while on remand at HMP Manchester, he told a prison priest he disposed of April's body in a river - thought to be the Dyfi close to where Bridger was arrested.\nThis conversation was the subject of legal arguments during the trial.\nThe jury was absent during the discussion and the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to submit the evidence.\nWhat was revealed during the trial was fragments of bone consistent with a juvenile human skull were found among ashes in the woodburner, along with April's blood near to a number of knives, including one which was badly burned.\nBridger's cottage had also been extensively cleaned.\nA library of child sex abuse images were found on his computer, and evidence of search terms including \"naked young five-year-old girls\" as well as pictures of murder victims including the Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.\nHe also had Facebook pictures of local young girls including April and her sisters.\nSentencing Bridger, Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said: \"For the last four weeks, the court has listened to compelling evidence of your guilt, evidence which has also demonstrated that you are a pathological and glib liar.\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile who has for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls, storing on your laptop not only images of pre-pubescent and pubescent girls but foul pornography of the gross sexual abuse of young children.\n\"What prompted you on Monday, 1 October to live out one of those fantasies is a matter for speculation but it may have been the combination of the ending of one sexual relationship and your drinking.\n\"Whatever, you set out to find a little girl to abuse. I am not sure you targeted April specifically... but you were on the prowl for a young girl.\"\nReferring to the grief of April's parents, he added: \"Without the knowledge of what happened to April, her parents will probably never come to terms with their grievous loss, described so eloquently in the impact statement.\n\"It is to be hoped, for their sake and for the sakes of all those who mourn April, that the verdicts will bring some measure of closure.\"\nA statement read earlier in court on behalf of April's mother said she would never forget that night they allowed their daughter out to play with her friend, something they had done hundreds of times before.\n\"Words alone cannot describe how we are feeling or how we manage to function on a daily basis and I would never want any other family to go through what we are and will go through for the rest of our lives,\" it read.\n\"April was born prematurely weighing only 4lbs 2oz and was in intensive care for two weeks. She has always been a little fighter and we later found out that she had a hole in her heart and a heart murmur.\"\nIt went on: \"As April's mother I will live with the guilt of letting her go out to play on the estate that night for the rest of my life.\n\"She fought to come into the world, she fought to stay in this world and he has taken her not only from us but from everyone who loved her.\n\"I will never see her smile again or hear her stomping around upstairs and on to the landing.\n\"We will never see her bring home her first boyfriend and Paul will never walk her down the aisle. How will we ever get over it?\"\nOutside the court, senior investigating officer Det Supt Andrew John said the strength of evidence against Bridger was overwhelming and he was responsible for the most horrific of crimes.\n\"Justice has been done and Mark Bridger, an evil and manipulative individual, will have his liberty taken off him,\" he said.\n\"He abducted and murdered April and has then gone to enormous lengths to destroy the evidence, conceal his involvement and avoid detection.\"\nApril's disappearance sparked the biggest missing person search in UK police history, focusing on around 650 areas near her home town and involving hundreds of experts as well as thousands of members of the public.\nDyfed-Powys Police received help from 45 other UK forces.\nInsp Gareth Thomas who led the search told the jury he was \"extremely confident\" that if April's body was anywhere in the vicinity, it would have been found.\nThe seven-month search for her remains was finally called off last month.", "summary": "The man found guilty of abducting and murdering five-year-old April Jones in a sexually motivated attack must spend the rest of his life behind bars.", "id": "22687971", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2328998/Mark-Bridger-jailed-life-April-Jones-abduction-murder-trial.html\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2328998/Mark-Bridger-jailed-life-April-Jones-abduction-", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nApril's disappearance sparked the biggest missing person search in UK police history, focusing on around 650 areas near her home town and involving hundreds of experts as well as thousands of members of the public.\nDyfed-Powys Police received help from 45 other UK forces.\nInsp Gareth Thomas who led the search told the jury he was \"extremely confident\" that if April's body was anywhere in", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nApril's disappearance sparked the biggest missing person search in UK police history, focusing on around 650 areas near her home town and involving hundreds of experts as well as thousands of members of the public.\nInsp Gareth Thomas who led the search told the jury he was \"extremely confident\" that if April's body was anywhere in the vicinity, it would have been found.\nThe jury heard that Bridger had", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\n\"The search for April was called off because we have found her body,\" he said.\n\"We have found her body and we have found her body.\n\"We have found her body and we have found her body.\n\"We have found her body and we have found her body.\n\"We have found her body and we have found her body.\n\"We have found her body and we have found her body.\n\"We have found her body and we have found", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nApril's mother, Coral, said she would never forget that night they allowed her go out to play on the estate that night for the rest of my life.\n\"I will never see her smile again or hear her stomping around upstairs and on to the landing.\n\"We will never see her bring home her first boyfriend and Paul will never walk her down the aisle.

A total of 296,438 farmers have killed themselves in India since 1995.\nThe latest numbers show a very welcome decline - until you look at the numbers more closely.\nWith a total of 7,653 cases, five key states - Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka -  still account for two-thirds of all farmer suicides in the country. There are no changes in the pattern there.  Also, 15 other states recorded mostly mild increases.\nAlso, with 3,146 suicides, Maharashtra, India's richest state, tops the grim list for the 12th year in a row. The state alone has accounted for an alarming 60,750 farm suicides since 1995.\nThe fall in numbers coincides with a growing trend of states with traditionally high farm suicide numbers declaring zero or near-zero suicides in recent years.\nChhattisgarh has done this three years in a row now since 2011: it has declared 0, 4 and 0 suicides. West Bengal recorded no suicides in both 2012 and 2013.\nWhat if we take a three-year average for these states before they began showing up virtually no suicides?\nFor Chhattisgarh that average was 1,567 suicides, and for West Bengal, 951.\nThis is not to say that states cannot or have not seen any decline at all. Also, one-off annual rises or falls are quite normal.\nIt is just that the nature of the decline as recorded in the past three years appears to be highly suspect.\nSo Chhattisgarh, a state that saw some 14,000 farm suicides from 2001 to 10, suddenly has none at all in the last three years.\nPondicherry, for long the worst among the federally-governed union territories in farm suicides, has declared a zero figure in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In 2010, it claimed only four suicides. But in 2009, its figure was 154 farm suicides.\n\"Clearly, massaging of the data continues,\" says Prof K Nagaraj, an economist at the Chennai-based Asian College of Journalism, whose study on farm suicides in India remains the most important one on the subject.\n\"When you want to play down very bad numbers in one column, you can't just erase them. You have to fit them into some other category. Shoving unwanted numbers into 'Others' is the common route to data massaging.\"\nAnd that's exactly the trend in the data that India's states have been submitting to the NCRB.\nHere's another thing that possibly gives away the heavy massaging the data have been subject to at the state level.\nOn the same page as the NCRB data which records the victims as \"Self-employed (farming/agriculture)\" is another column: \"Self-employed (Others).\"\nAs Chhattisgarh's farm suicide numbers have dwindled to zero, its numbers of suicides in this \"Self-employed (Others)\" column have swollen.\nIn the years when Chhattisgarh wasn't blanking out farm suicides numbers - 2008 and 2009, for example - its figures for suicides in this \"Others\" column were 826 and 851.\nIn the last two years, when it reported zero farm suicides, the numbers for others soared to 1,826 and 2,077.\nMaharashtra, which claims a decline of 640 in farm suicides, records a rise of over 1,000 suicides under \"Self-employed (Others).\"\nMadhya Pradesh records a decline of 82 in farm suicide numbers, but a rise of 236 in this \"Others\" category. Pondicherry shows a similar trend. West Bengal solved that problem by simply not filing any data at all in 2012.\nThose prematurely celebrating a decline in farm suicides miss another point.\nThere were 7.7 million fewer farmers in 2011 than there were in 2001, as the census data shows. Millions were and are either quitting the profession or losing full farmer status.\nIn that period, the country, on average, saw 2,000 fewer farmers each day. So there were surely even fewer farmers in 2013.\nAlso studies have shown that suicide rates among Indian farmers were 47% higher than they were for the rest of the population in 2011. In some of the states worst hit by the farm crisis, they were well over 100% higher.\nAre the suicides occurring because of drought and crop failure?\nFarmers have been killing themselves in years when the crop has been excellent and in the years it has failed.\nThey have taken their own lives in large numbers in very different years. When it rains they lose out; when it doesn't, they lose out worse.\nThere have been high suicide numbers in some good monsoon years. And so too, in years of drought.\nThe suicides have been occurring overwhelmingly amongst cash crop farmers - growers of cotton, sugar cane, groundnut, vanilla, coffee, pepper and others.\nFar fewer suicides occur amongst growers of paddy or wheat.\nCan we argue that drought kills cash crop farmers but not those cultivating food crops?\nIndia's south-west monsoon does have a significant impact on agriculture. But lack of a good monsoon is by no means the main reason for the farm suicides.\nWith the bulk of those suicides occurring amongst cash crop farmers, the issues of debt, rising input costs, water-use patterns, and severe price shocks and price volatility come much more to the fore.\nP Sainath is Rural Affairs Editor of The Hindu newspaper", "summary": "Are fewer farmers killing themselves in India today?", "id": "28205741", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27.

So instead, Recyclobekia collects such products from companies.\nTo fulfil the first order from Hong Kong, Mr Hemdan realised that he need to raise $15,000, but this was before he won the Injaz Egypt competition.\nInstead, to secure the money he needed Mr Hemdan managed to persuade a university professor to give him a loan, in exchange for 40% of the profit from the first sale.\nFour months later the first shipment was completed.\nWinning the entrepreneurship competition helped Recyclobekia to secure investment to expand the business, including $120,000 from two well-known Egyptian private investors, Khaled Ismail and Hussein el Sheikh, who both now sit on the company's board.\nHowever, the investment was initially unsettling.\n\"Here's where the problems began,\" says Mr Hemdan looking back. He stresses that \"working with a huge capital while you don't know how to run a company\" can lead to mistakes.\nMr Hemdan's error was to quickly expand the business, and overestimate how much waste he could collect.\nDespite partnering with companies to buy their waste, the amount they discarded was much lower than Recyclobekia expected, and in six months it had only managed to gather six tonnes, a lot less than expected.\nIn order to rectify the situation, Mr Hemdan realised he need to quickly improve his knowledge of an industry that was still very much in its infancy in Egypt.\nSo he flew to Hong Kong to study the work of recycling firms in the Chinese region.\nThe trip made Mr Hemdan realise that he had to change Recyclobekia's business model.\nAt the time it was simply collecting the old electronic items and sending them off to its buyer in Hong Kong. The Chinese firm would then break them apart, separate the materials, and sell them on to other companies which melted down and extracted the individual metals.\nMr Hemdan realised Recyclobekia could be more profitable if it cut out the middle man, and instead did all the dismantling work itself - it could get a better price for waste that had already been broken up and sorted.\nSo he ended the Hong Kong deal, and instead signed up with a German extraction company. This also reduced Recyclobekia's shipping costs.\nBut as Mr Hemdan attempted to schedule his first flight to Europe, he hit another hurdle.\n\"Having to do the military service is the greatest barrier to building my business,\" he says.\nIn Egypt, all males between the age of 18 and 30 are required by law to join the military for between one and three years.\nWhile students, like Mr Hemdan, can postpone it until they finish their studies, they can't travel abroad without special permission from the Ministry of Defence.\n\"Regulations only allow me to do it on the first semester of each academic year, which means I have to keep postponing trips, and limit them to those months,\" says Mr Hemdan.\nBy June 2013, Recyclobekia had come close to a deal with a German firm for investment, but a month later this was called off after the Egyptian military overthrew former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.\nMr Hemdan says: \"Media reports said that roads were closed by the army and terrorists were out in the streets... it was a disaster for us.\n\"By the end of 2013, we had lost most of the investment we had received.\"\nThis political turmoil, together with the fluctuations in the gold price had brought the company to the brink of collapse, but the entrepreneur weathered the storm by seeking alternative partners across the Atlantic, where Wisconsin-based Dynamic Recycling offered better payment terms.\nMr Hemdan is now planning to expand this business across the Middle East.\nThe entrepreneur has also joined forces with African online retailer Jumia to allow individuals to trade their electronic waste for vouchers to buy products.\nCon O'Donnell, an angel investor, and co-founder of Egypt's leading entrepreneurial event, RiseUp Summit, says: \"Mr Hemdan made the mistake a lot of younger entrepreneurs make and over-extended.

There are currently 117, up from 100 a couple of years ago, and 30 of these are small independents.\nHere three new independent whisky producers explain how they started out, and the challenges they face.\nThe time it takes to get your product to market can create challenges in securing the initial investment, as 38-year-old Kingsbarns Distillery founder Douglas Clement can testify.\nHe worked as a caddy in St Andrews for 20 years, and decided to start a whisky distillery after visiting golfers repeatedly expressed frustration at the lack of a nearby distillery. Mr Clement raised initial funds for Kingsbarns by approaching his golf clients then spent 18 months being rejected by venture capitalists.\n\"Most investors want a return in three to five years.  The trouble with whisky is that they won't see much for about 10 years,\" explains Mr Clement.\nThe turning point came in 2012 when he secured a \u00a3670,000 grant from the Scottish Government.  It was enough to convince one of the oldest families in Scotland, the Wemyss family which already own independent bottler Wemyss Malts, and gin brand Darnley's View, to invest \u00a32.5 to \u00a33m.\nMr Clement sold his interest in the venture to them, and he is now employed as visitor centre manager, though remains founding director, an arrangement he says he's \"extremely happy\" with.\n\"This project for me personally was never about profit. It was about taking my idea for a whisky distillery by the home of golf and the area I was born and raised, and turning it into a reality,\" he says.\nIt will be summer 2018 before the first release of Kingsbarns single malt. In the meantime, they are finding other ways to make money, such as the income from their visitor centre, shop and cafe.\nFor the Shetland Distillery Company, a visitor centre was not a viable option because of the remoteness of their base on the Unst, the most northern of the Shetland islands.\nInstead the four founders have opted to distil gin, as a means of generating income while they wait for the whisky to mature, due to the lower start-up costs of around \u00a3110,000.\nStuart Nickerson, 59, has worked in the whisky industry for more than three decades. To establish the Shetland Distillery he has his wife Wilma have joined forces with fellow married couple Frank and Debbie Strang.\nThe firm has been funded with their own money, and grants from the Scottish Government's economic and community development agency. They began selling gin in November 2014, and so far they've produced around 10,000 bottles.\nLater this year they will build the whisky distillery at a cost of \u00a31.5m, for the equipment, and another \u00a3250,000 each year to build stock.  For this, they are looking at debt financing and more grants.\nMr Nickerson says: \"Shetland is the only area in Scotland that [currently] has no whisky distillery. It's very remote on Unst, to get here, it's a 12-hour journey.\n\"There are cost challenges associated with that. Whatever we make has to compete at the higher end of the market because of our higher costs.\"\nAnthony Wills, the 59-year-old founder of Kilchoman Distillery on the Isle of Islay, knows all about weighing up the options when it comes to getting the business started.\nHe ran his own independent whisky bottling company for eight years, but decided to start producing it himself.\nTotal set-up costs for the first distillery to be built on Islay for 124 years were \u00a36m from 30 private investors, as well as \u00a3500,000 of Mr Wills' own money.\nHe says that raising funds was the most difficult part, and, when he found it hard to raise more than \u00a31m, he opted to build the distillery anyway.\n\"It was a bit risky but I thought it would be easier to raise the balance once people could see the operation,\" he says. \"It worked, but we've had times when it's been pretty hairy.\"\nProduction began in December 2005, and the first malt came on the market in September 2009 with 8,000 bottles on limited release - they sold out within two weeks.\nIn whisky terms, the distillery had success very early, making a profit in its fifth year.  The whisky remains in high demand - the cheapest bottle costing \u00a345 and the most expensive \u00a380 - and, in 2014, the firm's turnover was \u00a33.6m.\nIt's an undoubted success, but Mr Wills says it has not been easy.\n\"If I'd looked at it rationally, I would never have done it. It's been a lot of hard work and grief but, for us, it's been worth it.\"", "summary": "\"Once you're selling everything you make, it's a licence to print money,\" says whisky consultant Jim Swan.", "id": "35300685", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

If you have no estate, or the estate isn't sufficient to cover all liabilities, they get written off and creditors cannot chase surviving family members, no matter how big the debt. However, there are some exceptions.\"\nWith unsecured debts, if the debt is in joint names, it is likely that a next of kin may have signed a \"joint and several liability agreement\" when the debt was taken out, says Ms Hamilton.\nThis means if one of the party stops paying the debt, because of financial difficulties or death, the other named party would have to pay the balance.\n277\npeople made bankrupt daily\n31.5m\nplastic card purchases each day in March\n\u00a36,065 avg household debt, excluding mortgages\n\u00a33,192 avg borrowing per adult\n\u00a328,756 avg owed per adult\nWith joint mortgages it depends whether the agreement signed was as beneficial joint tenants or as tenants in common, she says.\n\"Broadly speaking, if you are beneficial joint tenants, you both own the whole home, so if one of you passes away, the surviving party automatically becomes sole owner.\n\"If you are tenants in common, the deceased's share may form part of their estate.\n\"However, if one party has experienced a debt problem in the past and the property has been brought into the equation, for instance in bankruptcy, this can automatically change a beneficial joint tenancy into a tenants in common agreement and this isn't automatically reversed.\n\"This can mean that a historic debt problem can bring about surprises upon the death of one party.\"\nMs Hamilton says if someone is struggling to keep up with debt payments, they should contact a free debt advice provider or speak to lenders directly.\n\"Some lenders may offer a moratorium, suspending payments entirely and making a claim on any estate once you pass away, or they may offer a complete write-off. It's at their discretion though,\" she says.\nCaroline Hamilton from the Money Advice Service's checklist:\nPayment protection (unsecured debt) - some policies may pay off the full balance upon death of one or both parties\nLife cover (mortgages) - likely to pay off the whole balance and remove the home from the deceased's estate (where it may have otherwise formed part)\nAuthorised user status - not all joint debts are actually joint. For instance, credit cards are never lent on a joint and several basis. Instead there is one account holder who can request additional cards for authorised users. Only the account holder is liable to repay any outstanding balance\nMoney Advice Service: Debt Test\nAccording to statistics from 2013 by the debt charity StepChange, people aged over 60 are disproportionately less likely to seek debt advice than young people.\nHowever, it appears that at any age people are hesitant to seek help.\nA recent survey conducted by Comres for the BBC found 69% of British adults in debt have not asked for advice on managing their debts. The poll surveyed 1,000 respondents between 23 and 25 May 2014.\nMr Barber, who also worked as a debt adviser at one stage in his life, says that those with problem debt often do conceal it.\n\"Most people try and hide the fact from everybody, they're not honest about it and part of that is they really don't look around enough to find out what they can do about it.\n\"It's almost as if they roll over and let the debt take over and control their lives,\" he says.\nAccording to Lucy Malenczuk, policy adviser at Age UK, many older people are also not aware of the support they can receive too.\n\"We know lots of older people are not claiming benefits that they're entitled to, and so it would be great to stop people having to take on debt that they perhaps don't need if they just got all the help they could.\"\nMr Barber's daily life is affected by his debt. He has had to sell his car because he cannot afford to run it and does not socialise because he cannot afford to go out, but he remains positive about the future:\n\"I've just got to work and try and do something to get myself out of it if I want to go back to the lifestyle I had before, and that is my motivation.\"\nFind out more about the impact of debt in the UK on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Breakfast TV and BBC North West Tonight on Tuesday, 10 June.", "summary": "One in 50 people in their seventies has problem debt according to Age UK, but what happens if you cannot pay off these debts later on in life?", "id": "27732054", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n\"I've just got to work and try and do something to get myself out of it if I want to go back to the lifestyle I had before, and that is my motivation.\"\nSource: The Money Charity\nFind out more about the impact of debt in the UK on BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Breakfast TV and BBC North West Tonight on Tuesday, 10 June.\n\"I've just got to work and", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\n\"I've just got to work and try and do something to get myself out of it if I want to go back to the lifestyle I had before, and that is my motivation.\"\n\"I've just got to work and try and do something to get myself out of it if I want to go back to the lifestyle I had before, and that is my motivation.\"\n\"I've just got to work and try and do something to get", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\n\"I think it's a bit of a myth that people are not claiming benefits, because they are, but they're not claiming the right ones.\n\"I think it's a bit of a myth that people are not claiming benefits, because they are, but they're not claiming the right ones.\n\"I think it's a bit of a myth that people are not claiming benefits, because they are, but they're not claim", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\n\"We know that many older people are not claiming benefits, and so it would be great to stop people having to take on debt that they don't need if they just got to work.\"\nMr Barber says that the government is not going to help.\n\"We know that many older people are not claiming benefits, and so it would be great to stop people having to take on debt that they don't need if they just got to work.\"\nMr", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Money Advice Service is a free, independent service set up by the government to help people manage their money.\nIt offers free, unbiased money advice to people in the UK.\nThe Money Advice Service website has a range of tools and calculators to help people manage their money.\nThe Money Advice Service also has a free debt test to help people understand their debt and what they can do about it.\nThe Money Advice Service", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not sure how much of a problem debt is for people, but I know that it's a big problem for some people.\n\"I'm not sure how much of a problem debt is for people, but I know that it's a big problem for some people.\n\"I'm not sure how much of a problem debt is for people, but I know that it's a big problem for some people.\n\"I'", "decode_al_1_be_12_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not sure how much of this is going to be on the news, but I'm sure it's going to be a lot of it.\n\"I'm not sure how much of this is going to be on the news, but I'm sure it's going to be a lot of it.\n\"I'm not sure how much of this is going to be on the news, but I'm sure it's going to be", "decode_al_15_be_08_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not sure I'd be able to cope with it now, but I'm sure I'd be able to cope with it then.\n\"I'm not sure I'd be able to cope with it now, but I'm sure I'd be able to cope with it then.\"\nMr Barber says he is not sure he would be able to cope with his debt now, but he is sure he would", "decode_al_15_be_1_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not sure that the BBC is not a good thing, but it's a good thing that the BBC is not a good thing, but it's a good thing that the BBC is not a good thing, but it's a good thing that the BBC is not a good thing, but it's a good thing that the BBC is not a good thing, but it's a good thing that the BBC is not a good thing, but it's", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_3": "\n\"I've just got to work and try and do something to get myself out of it if I want to go back to the lifestyle I had before, and that is my motivation.\"\nFind out more about the impact of debt in the UK on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Breakfast TV and BBC North West Tonight on Tuesday, 10 June.\nFind out more about the impact of debt in the UK on BBC Radio 5", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_3": "\nThe Money Advice Service has a free debt advice service.\nThe Money Advice Service has a free debt advice service.\nThe Money Advice Service has a free debt advice service.\nThe Money Advice Service has a free debt advice service.\nThe Money Advice Service has a free debt advice service.

her way to a constituency surgery when she was set upon in front of two of her assistants and shocked constituents.\nMair shot the 41-year-old with a sawn-off rifle and stabbed her with a dagger, turning on 78-year-old Bernard Kenny, who tried to stop him. In a raid of his home nearby, police found Nazi-related material.\nThomas Mair: The man who murdered MP Jo Cox\nWhat the judge told Thomas Mair\nBrendan Cox: 'Jo strengthened, not silenced'\nConviction closes 'sad chapter' for Birstall\nWestminster reacts to verdicts\nRolling coverage and reaction to verdicts\nThe jury found Mair guilty of having a firearm with intent, causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Mr Kenny and having a dagger.\nThe judge gave him a whole life tariff, saying he was likely to spend the rest of his life in jail.  He said  the offence was so exceptional that Mair could only be released by a secretary of state.\nMair, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, remained impassive as the verdicts were read out, after just over 90 minutes of deliberations.\nHe had not entered a plea and chose not to give evidence in his defence at the trial.\nBut before sentencing, Mair asked to speak to the courtroom. The judge declined, saying he had already had an opportunity.\nAddressing Mair, Mr Justice Wilkie said: \"You affect to be a patriot. The words you uttered repeatedly when you killed her, give lip service to that concept.\n\"Those sentiments can be legitimate and can have resonance but in your mouth, allied to your actions, they are tainted and made toxic.\"\nMair's inspiration was not love of country but admiration for Nazism, the judge said.\n\"Our parents' generation made huge sacrifices to defeat those ideas and values in the Second World War. What you did, and your admiration for those views which informed your crime, betrays the sacrifices of that generation.\"\nHe said Mair had not the courage to acknowledge what he had done and forced Mrs Cox's family to relive the events.\nBy contrast, your second victim of the day - Mr Kenny - acted \"instinctively and courageously\" to try to save Mrs Cox and deserves the highest praise, he said to Mair.\nMr Justice Wilkie said the murder was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism, associated with Nazism.\nHe said an aggravating feature was the weeks of planning in which Mair researched Mrs Cox, a past assassination of a serving MP and matricide, knowing she was the mother of young children.\nThe judge described Mrs Cox as \"a wonderful mother, daughter, sister, partner, and companion\".\nHe said her generosity of spirit was \"evident in the selfless concern she had for others, even when facing a violent death\", referring to Mrs Cox's plea to her assistants to get away and save themselves, as she lay dying in the street.\nDaniela Relph, BBC News correspondent\nThe jury took just one hour and 36 minutes to reach its verdicts. Every seat in courtroom eight of the Old Bailey was filled as the jury foreman stood to deliver the guilty verdicts.\nFrom Mair there was no reaction. He had maintained his silence throughout the trial and during every police interview.\nAs the verdicts were delivered, Jo Cox's family smiled. Her sister, Kim, held her mother's hand. Then Jo Cox's husband read a victim impact statement.\nStanding in the witness box, in front of the man who murdered his wife, Brendan Cox told Mair that he pitied him because his life was devoid of love and consumed by hatred. It was a highly charged moment.\nThe Cox family watched as Mair was led away, in silence, to begin his life sentence.\nIn a statement read to a packed courtroom at the Old Bailey, Mrs Cox's husband Brendan said he was not there for \"retribution\" and felt \"nothing but pity\" for Mair.\nLater, speaking outside court, he said his wife's killing was an incompetent and self-defeating act of terrorism that was driven by hatred but instead created an outpouring of love.\nHis family would not respond to hatred with hatred, he said, and Jo's ideas and values would live on in her children, and family.\nOutside court, Mrs Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater said she and her parents, Jean and Gordon, were relieved that the process was over after a difficult few months.\n\"We can and we will work through our pain and, as a family, we are stronger and more united than ever.\n\"I, for one, will not be beaten by what has happened and I know I am not alone - it is the last thing my sister would want,\" she said.\n\"There may have been one act of extreme cowardice on that day, but there were acts of extreme bravery,\" she added.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mair had \"robbed the world of an ambassador of kindness\" and urged her fellow MPs to confront those who wish to promote the hatred and division that led to her murder.\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd called it a \"shocking and senseless murder\" that was \"an attack on all of us and the values we share of democracy and tolerance\".\n\"As home secretary, I am determined that we challenge extremism in all its forms including the evil of far right extremism and the terrible damage it can cause to individuals, families and communities,\" she said.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: \"Mair has offered no explanation for his actions but the prosecution was able to demonstrate that, motivated by hate, his pre-meditated crimes were nothing less than acts of terrorism designed to advance his twisted ideology.\"\nThe CPS said it worked closely with police to build a strong case, and commended a number of \"brave\" eye witnesses who gave evidence.\nMair was a \"cold-blooded killer\" who lived a solitary lifestyle, with no social circle and had never come to the notice of the police before, DS Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, said.\nNothing could ever excuse the evil and the horror that he brought to the small town of Birstall, he added.", "summary": "Thomas Mair has been jailed for life after being found guilty of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.", "id": "38079594", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe 53-year-old shot and stabbed to death the mother-of-two in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June, a week before the EU referendum vote.

It is a practical signing which Arsenal will hope develops into an excellent one.\nThe move brought a mixed response from Arsenal fans, who may have wished for a so-called bigger name, particularly the Old Trafford-bound Falcao, but Welbeck is an England international with an exemplary attitude and there is room for his game to grow.\nThere was an inquiry made for Manchester City's Matija Nastasic as Wenger pondered strengthening his defensive resources and some will question the absence of a powerful central midfield player.\nWenger, however, has a strict transfer policy of refusing to pay over the odds or simply making a signing for a signing's sake.\nNow it is up to Welbeck to repay the faith - and there is every chance he will improve under Wenger's guidance.\nChelsea and Manchester City spent transfer deadline day pruning the margins of their squads, or in the latter's case accepting an offer from Valencia for Alvaro Negredo that includes an obligation to complete a 30m euros deal at the end of the season.\nBoth clubs had clear plans in place for the players they wanted to bring in, those they wanted out - with City also securing all of the big contract renewals for key players.\nChelsea moved swiftly to sign Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, as well as defender Felipe Luis, so manager Jose Mourinho was able to enjoy a relatively relaxed deadline day. The main business was done.\nCosta, in particular, and Fabregas have both made outstanding starts. It has been a smooth transition.\nCity's summer was well structured. Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando were earmarked some time ago and they were able to avoid any late panics or trolley dashes.\nLike Mourinho, Manuel Pellegrini had his pieces in place and City were able to be part of the Falcao conversation without feeling the need to become more seriously involved, the deal pushed in their direction rather than the other way around.\nManchester United produced the most eye-catching piece of business as news broke early on transfer deadline day that they were signing Falcao.\nThe Colombian striker, who missed the World Cup with a serious knee injury, had been touted around many clubs and linked with Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City.\nNo-one can doubt Falcao's quality or pedigree - the main questions surrounding the deal are whether he is what United need and how manager Louis van Gaal will utilise him.\nWith the presence of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, as well as British record \u00a359.7m signing Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata and youngster Adnan Januzaj, Van Gaal has an embarrassment of riches that enabled United to sanction the sale of Welbeck to rivals Arsenal.\nHowever, they have looked short of strength and numbers in central defence and central midfield. Have they put the roof on the house while the foundations remain in need of serious attention?\nVan Gaal will be hoping Marcos Rojo's work permit issues are swiftly resolved to bolster United's defence, while AS Roma's Kevin Strootman will be a January target.\nOne solution may well be to drop Rooney into a deeper role and use Falcao and Van Persie as his main strikers. A nice problem to solve - but other problems may not be quite as palatable for Van Gaal.\nLiverpool have been major players in the transfer window as manager Brendan Rodgers revamped his squad with the \u00a375m he received from Barcelona for Luis Suarez.\nPlenty of attention will be centred on Mario Balotelli after his shock \u00a316m arrival from AC Milan and the early signs were good as he worked hard and well alongside Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge in the 3-0 win at Tottenham. Caution required though - Mario nearly always starts well before the rot sets in.\nRodgers has brought in nine players to flesh out the squad that performed so well to finish second in the Premier League last season and the likes of Dejan Lovren and Alberto Moreno, along with Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic, will be important figures.\nSpurs had trouble getting an influx of new players to adjust following the \u00a386m sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid last summer - Rodgers will introduce his new faces more carefully and hope for greater success.\nSouthampton fell prey to rival clubs this summer with manager Mauricio Pochettino moving to Spurs and the likes of Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Calum Chambers lured away.\nAll eyes were on new manager Ronald Koeman but there has been a strong response on the pitch with an unfortunate opening weekend loss at Liverpool and a fine win at West Ham United.\nOff the pitch Koeman has been backed with much of the money Saints brought in, with the \u00a310m signing of Senegal forward Sadio Mane from Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg on Monday taking spending to around \u00a375m.\nThere was much pessimism associated with St Mary's as the exodus went on - but the early signs are good that Southampton can move into the new era with confidence.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHull City's transfer deadline day activity was proof of how far manager Steve Bruce has brought the club in a short space of time.\nUruguay striker Abel Hernandez arrived from Palermo in a club record \u00a310m deal while the arrivals of Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle United and Gaston Ramirez from Southampton will capture the imagination. Mo Diame's arrival from West Ham United will beef up midfield.\nBruce did a superb job in establishing Hull in the Premier League last season, as well as reaching the FA Cup final, and these deals signpost the new ambition and hope under Bruce, who has a history of being able to persuade big-name players to come to his clubs.", "summary": "The transfer window has closed and now clubs and managers know what they will be dealing with until it reopens on 1 January.", "id": "29022174", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe arrival of Ben Arfa and Ramirez will be a big boost to the club and the fans.\nThe club have been linked with a number of big names and the arrival of Hernandez is a statement of intent.\nThe club have been linked with a number of big names and the arrival of Hernandez is a statement of intent.

Only in the last few years have researchers started to explore how the microscopically small plants could affect future melting.\nA five-year UK research project known as Black and Bloom is under way to investigate the different species of algae and how they might spread, and then to use this knowledge to improve computer projections of future sea level rise.\nThe possibility of biologically inspired melting was not included in the estimates for sea level rise published by the UN's climate panel, the IPCC, in its latest report in 2013.\nThat study said the worst-case scenario was a rise of 98cm by the end of the century.\nOne concern now is that rising temperatures will allow algae to flourish not only on the slopes of the narrow margins of the ice-sheet but also on the flat areas in the far larger interior where melting could happen on a much bigger scale.\nWe joined the latest phase of research in which scientists set up camp on the ice-sheet to gather accurate measurements of the \"albedo\" or the amount of solar radiation reflected by the surface.\nWhite snow reflects up to 90% of solar radiation while dark patches of algae will only reflect about 35% or even as little as 1% in the blackest spots.\nWhen we flew by helicopter onto the ice sheet, the rolling landscape seemed surprisingly grey - my first impression was that it looked dirty.\nMuch of the surface was covered with what looked like patches of soot and it was pockmarked with countless holes at the bottom of which were pitch-black layers of a mix of algae, bacteria and minerals known as cryoconite.\nProf Martyn Tranter of Bristol University, who is leading the project, told me:\n\"People are very worried about the possibility that the ice sheet might be melting faster and faster in the future.\n\"We suspect that in a warming climate these dark algae will grow over larger and larger parts of the Greenland ice sheet and it might well be that they will cause more melting and an acceleration of sea level rise.\n\"Our project is trying to understand just how much melting might occur.\"\nOver the last 20 years, Greenland has been losing more ice than it gains through snowfall in winter - a change in a natural balance that normally keeps the ice-sheet stable.\nAnd one of the project scientists, Dr Andrew Tedstone, a glaciologist and also of Bristol University, said that over much of the same period, images from the MODIS satellite showed a darkening trend with the years of greatest dark producing most meltwater.\nHe said: \"We still don't think we've reached a point where we've seen the maximum darkness that we're going to see in this area so the fieldwork we're doing is to try to find out in a warming climate 'do we think the area is going to get any darker than we've already seen in the last 15 years?'\"\nEarlier research had found that the ice sheet is covered with a range of contaminants carried on the winds including dust and soot from as far away as Canadian prairie fires and the industrial heartlands of China, America and Europe.\nBut studies over the past five years have shown that the majority of the dark material may be biological with different kinds of algae turning the ice black, brown, green and even mauve.\n\"This is a living landscape,\" according to Dr Joe Cook, a glacial microbiologist at Sheffield University.\n\"This is an extremely difficult place for anything to live but, as we look around us, all this darkness we can see on the ice surface is living - algae, microbes, living and reproducing in the ice sheet and changing its colour.\"\n\"We know they're very widespread and we know that they're very dark and we know that that's accelerating melt but that's not something that's built into any of our climate projections - and that's something that needs to change.\"\nThe final phase of the Black and Bloom project involves weaving the new factor of biological darkening into climate models to come up with revised estimates for future sea level rise.\nAnd, as Dr Cook explained, the retreat of the Greenland ice sheet does not need to be total to have a widespread and damaging impact.\n\"When we say the ice sheet is melting faster, no one saying it's all going to melt in next decade or the next 100 years or even the next 1,000 years but it doesn't all have to melt for more people to be in danger - only a small amount has to melt to threaten millions in coastal communities around world.\"\nMeanwhile, another factor that may be driving the melting has been identified by an Austrian member of the team, Stefan Hofer, a PhD student at Bristol.\nIn a paper recently published in Science Advances, he analysed satellite imagery and found that over the past 20 years there has been a 15% decrease in cloud cover over Greenland in the summer months.\n\"It was definitely a 'wow' moment,\" he told me.\nAlthough temperature is an obvious driver of melting, the paper estimated that two-thirds of additional melting, above the long-term average, was attributable to clearer skies.\nWhat is not known is how this might affect the algae. Their darker pigments are believed to be a protection from ultra violet light - so more sunshine might encourage that process of darkening or prove to be damaging to them.\nThe Black and Bloom project, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc), aims to publish its new projections for sea level rise in two years' time.\nFollow David on Twitter. and Join him for a live Facebook chat at 15:30 with Arctic explorer Pen Hadow ahead of his mission to sail to the North Pole.", "summary": "Scientists are \"very worried\" that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could accelerate and raise sea levels more than expected.", "id": "40686984", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Greenland ice sheet is the largest mass of ice in the northern hemisphere covering an area about seven times the size of the United Kingdom and reaching up to 3km (2 miles) in thickness.\nIt is the largest mass of ice in the northern hemisphere covering an area about seven times the size of the United Kingdom and reaching up to 3km (2 miles) in thickness.

They complain that the migrants will disturb the tranquillity of the resort. They are also worried that the young men will be unsupervised and break into homes that have been closed up for the winter.\nLess vocal are those who don't mind the arrival of the Afghan migrants, those who think it's only human to welcome those who have spent so many months in the squalor of Calais.\nFor the migrants, it should be a short stay. They will be encouraged to claim asylum in France and then maybe move onto more permanent housing. But even here, several hundred kilometres from Calais, the allure of the UK is still strong.\nFrom the hotel you can clearly see the island of Jersey - British shores are still without reach.\nAt least 40 of the 60 coaches planned to transport them have now left, according to BBC correspondents at the scene.\nIn a statement (in French), French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said 2,318 migrants had been \"given shelter\" on Monday.\nHe said 1,918 adults had been taken away on 45 buses to 80 reception centres.\nFour hundred minors were transferred to \"provisional reception centres\" within the camp, he added.\nThe first step of the clearance had taken place in a \"calm and controlled manner\", he said.\nSome volunteers complained earlier that the migrants had not been given enough information about the plans and warned of a sense of confusion and chaos.\nAbout 7,500 beds are being made available in 450 centres across France. So far migrants have been taken to the regions of:\nRue des Garennes links the Jungle camp to the new migrant processing centre, and is a street of suitcases and resignation.\nAt 05:00, three hours before the clearance operation was due to start, groups of refugees and migrants began to form a queue. Since then, a mass exodus from the camp, and hundreds are now lining the road waiting for a coach to take them away.\nTowards the back of the queue is Adil from Sudan, carrying two bags, a football and a guitar. \"My dream is dead, the people you see here, they are broken. We can't believe it's over.\"\nInside the camp, aid workers from Care for Calais are moving tent to tent, warning migrants that if they do not leave, they will be arrested. The police presence is large, with many huddled in riot vans, keeping out of the cold, and making the most of the calm.\nChildren will be housed in the camp's converted shipping containers while the rest of the Jungle is dismantled.\nThe \"Dubs amendment\" rules allow particularly vulnerable children - such as girls and those under 13 - refuge in the UK, even if they do not have family already in the country.\nThe operation to clear the tents and shelters is expected to take three days.\nThe French interior ministry said \"police might be forced to intervene\" if there was unrest during the demolition.\nThere are reports that British activists from the No Borders group have travelled to the Jungle to try to disrupt the process.\nViolence has frequently broken out as migrants, mainly from Africa and the Middle East, attempt to board lorries bound for the UK and clash with drivers and police.\nMost believe there is a better prospect of finding work. Many want to claim asylum, although others want to enter incognito and remain as illegal workers.\nThe language issue is also important - many speak English but do not have a European language. Some also have relatives in the UK and that is a big draw.\nSome are attracted by a belief that there is better housing and education available.\nSome commentators believe illegal migrants also perceive Britain as a \"soft touch\" for benefits and a better place to find \"black economy\" jobs, although studies do not necessarily back up this view.\nA UK-funded wall 1km (0.6 miles) long is being built along the main road to the port in an attempt to deter would-be stowaways. The UK government is reported to have contributed about \u00c2\u00a31.9m (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.2m) to the cost of the wall, which is due to be finished by the end of the year.\nSpeaking to the BBC, the head of the organisation that runs the port of Calais, Jean-Marc Puissensseau, said business had declined due to attempts by migrants to board trucks.\n\"The port has been really suffering [for] more than one year, because each night there were some attacks, or [migrants] were throwing branches, trees, everything to try to slow down the traffic and then to get into the trucks,\" he said.\nWhat is the Jungle?\nLast year more than one million migrants - many fleeing the civil war in Syria - arrived in Europe. Countries struggled to cope and division arose in the EU over how best to deal with resettling people.\nAn EU-Turkey pact to try to stop migrants crossing to Greece and moves by Balkan nations to close their borders have driven down the number of people using the so-called eastern Mediterranean route.\nHowever, migrants from African countries such as Eritrea and Somalia as well as West African nations such as Nigeria and the Gambia are continuing to attempt the crossing from Libya to Italy.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

They have divided opinion in a city which has seen an influx of well-paid tech workers in recent years but struggled to house its poorer citizens.\nNow a new ballot measure, backed financially by tech investors and to be voted on by residents next month, is proposing to introduce laws against the tent camps.\nProposition Q would give the city the right to tear down camps and remove residents' belongings. Police would have to give 24 hours notice and find a shelter for anyone they turf out.\nSupporters say the measure prioritises housing over dangerous camp environments. Opponents say it is yet another move to criminalise the homeless.\nHere's what you need to know about Prop Q.\nIn theory, a police officer or other city worker would offer someone sleeping in a tent a room in a shelter for the night, or a paid bus ticket out of the city to a family member or friend, under the city's existing \"Homeward Bound\" programme.\nIf the homeless person refused, they would be given 24 hours notice to dismantle their tent and vacate the site. If they failed to comply, the city would remove the tent and store the owner's possessions for up to 90 days.\nProp Q was drawn up and sponsored by Mark Farrell, a San Francisco city supervisor. Mr Farrell told the BBC that the camps had become \"the symbol of the city's homeless problem\" and were \"some of the most dangerous places you can imagine\".\n\"From documented rapes, to fires, to tonnes and tonnes of waste - these camps are a significant strain on our public safety resources,\" he said.\nMr Farrell and Prop Q's other advocates say no one will be moved on from a camp unless there is a guaranteed bed for them that night.\nHe said that allowing the camps to remain and providing water or other assistance would encourage homeless people to come to the city.\n\"If word got out... we would see a massive influx of tent camps in the city,\" he said.\nMr Farrell said he \"completely rejected\" the accusation that the law would criminalise the homeless. \"This is about rejecting dangerous living environments and prioritising shelter and housing,\" he said.\nIn the other corner is San Francisco city supervisor John Avalos, Prop Q's official opposition. Mr Avalos called Prop Q \"a political move\".\n\"Police already have all the powers they need to move encampments,\" he said in an interview. \"This measure is on the ballot so voters can vote with their anger about homelessness.\"\nHe said the key to solving homelessness was to focus resources on supportive housing. \"This measure does not do anything to increase supportive housing, it pushes people from sidewalk to sidewalk, from block to block, in the hope of housing that doesn't exist.\"\n\"This is kind of like a tough love measure,\" he said. \"But we know from the past, they tend to operate on very little love and mostly toughness.\"\nAlso opposing the law is San Francisco's Coalition on Homelessness charity. Jennifer Friedenbach, the charity's executive director, called it \"an incredibly deceptive measure\" and warned it would stir up hate against the homeless.\n\"It's already illegal for tents to be on the sidewalks,\" she said. \"So it bears the question why put it on the ballot? The only reason is to have the homeless vilified to draw out more conservative voters.\"\nNot exactly. San Francisco has a lower homelessness rate than many major US cities including LA, Seattle, and Washington DC.\nBut San Francisco does have a significantly higher proportion of unsheltered homeless people - 511 per 100,000 people, according to 2015 data from the city's Housing Department. That's more than five times the rate of unsheltered homeless than Washington DC, which has twice the overall rate of homelessness.\nAnd San Francisco's homelessness rate is slowing growing, according to the Housing Department's biannual survey.\nOne of the central arguments against Prop Q is that there aren't enough rooms in shelters to move people to, so the homeless will just get pushed around.\nMr Farrell says that a new so-called Navigation Centre under development, plus the city's existing sheltered housing, will total 1,500 rooms, against just 600 people believed to be in tent camps.\nBut opponents point to the total number of homeless in the city, thought to be at least 6,500 but possibly as high as 9,500, and say there is already a long daily waiting list for a room.\n\"We have over 800 people waiting for shelter,\" said Ms Friedenbach, \"and the city would hold shelter beds empty in order to offer them to people in encampments, putting other elderly people and people with disabilities who are in those shelter beds out on the streets.\"\nAccording to a 2015 study by California's University of Berkeley, the average city in the state has nine homelessness laws - significantly more than in other states. San Francisco has the most - 23 laws.\nSan Francisco's include so called \"sit-lie\" - a 2010 measure which bans sitting or lying on the sidewalk during daytime hours and is punishable by up to six months in prison.\nAnd a 2015 measure against begging which set a 20ft perimeter around cash machines and made it illegal to ask for money again from someone who had refused.\nThat measure did also include provisions to get more homeless people into drug or mental health programmes instead of prison.\nAccording to a report by the Guardian, wealthy tech investors have donated significant amounts of money to the campaign for Prop Q. The newspaper reported that Sequoia Capital chairman Michael Moritz, tech angel investor Ron Conway, and hedge-fund investor William Oberndorf donated $49,999 each to a war chest totalling $270,000.\nMr Farrell said the campaign had also had large numbers of small donations from ordinary voters, but the news that rich investors putting up most of the funds has angered many.\n\"These are people who spend more money in a year than homeless people have for a budget for food for six years... I mean how awful to have a billionaire funding a campaign to take away people's tents,\" Ms Friedenbach said.\nAnti-homelessness legislation has typically been popular among voters in San Francisco and proponents say they are confident of it passing.

Their lead came when a James Keatings free-kick was knocked back across goal by Fontaine to Hanlon, who put it away.\nAt that point, and for a long time after, they looked like certain winners. Four minutes after Hanlon scored, Holt should have made it two, but the veteran striker missed a total sitter at the back post. Keatings then had two attempts, both saved by Lee Robinson.

But over months and years, trust has eroded between Kevin Pietersen and the ECB.\n\"There is a massive trust issue between me and Kevin.\n\"While there is no trust between Kevin and the ECB, it is our opinion he cannot feature in our short-term plans. Long-term, who knows?\"\nSpeaking on Monday, before his meeting with Strauss, Pietersen said he was \"desperate\" to return to the international game, adding: \"Personal differences have got nothing to do with what the public wants. The public just wants to see the England team winning.\n\"What more can I do? All I can do is score runs. I'm incredibly proud of how I played under pressure.\"\nPietersen reduced his Indian Premier League commitments this year to play for Surrey after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves suggested an international return might be possible if he were to score runs in domestic cricket.\nBut Strauss's assertion that the South Africa-born batsman will not be considered for selection could signal the end of a career that took in 8,181 runs and 23 centuries in 104 Tests.\nPietersen last played for England in the final Test of a 5-0 Ashes series defeat in Australia in January 2014.\nHe was sacked a month later and released an autobiography in October criticising several players, saying there was a \"bullying culture\" in the squad.\nIn July 2014, Strauss apologised for making an offensive remark about his former team-mate during a live television broadcast.\nAndrew Strauss offered Pietersen a role as an advisor on a board to improve the one-day side, which was turned down.\nHe said: \"Kevin has got brilliant experience in one-day cricket and I think it would be madness not to try to get that information out of his head and help us form a strategy for English cricket going forwards.\n\"That's why I asked him to be on that board. Ultimately that may be an opportunity for us to start rebuilding trust.\"\nPeter Moores was dismissed as England head coach on the same day Strauss was appointed as director of cricket.\nIt was Moores' second spell in charge of the team, which finished with a dismal World Cup performance and a drawn Test series in the West Indies.\n\"That was a very tough decision to take,\" Strauss told BBC Sport. \"He's a very popular coach and has got some really strong attributes as a coach.\n\"I personally think he's got some limitations in the international arena around strategy and tactics and I think we saw that in the World Cup to a certain extent.\n\"But he was undermined greatly by the fact he had done the job before. He needed time and space to take the England cricket team forward and he was never going to get that.\"\nFormer Australia seamer Jason Gillespie, 40, is the current Yorkshire head coach and led the club from Division Two to the County Championship title within three years.\nStrauss confirmed he is \"one of the candidates\" to replace Moores and said he wants someone in place in time for the Ashes, which begin in July.\n\"It is one of the top two coaching jobs in world cricket and there are a lot of ambitious coaches who want to prove they can cut the mustard at this level.\"\nStrauss said Alastair Cook would remain as captain for the summer, with Joe Root \"stepping up\" to vice captain and Eoin Morgan remaining in charge of the one-day side.\n\"Alastair Cook has my full backing to lead the side into the Ashes this summer. He has had a brutally tough last 18 months, with his own form and one-day captaincy.\n\"Selection is something we need to look at. There have been times where there are issues around responsibility and accountability - I want to look at that this summer.\"\nStrauss said he would not play a \"tracksuit\" role, instead leaving the coaching of the side to Moores' replacement.\nHe added that it would be his job to \"make sure we are not off pace for the next World Cup\".\n\"I am not going to be in the dressing room. That is not my role. The captain and the coach will be in control.\"\nECB chief executive Tom Harrison echoed Strauss's opinion on Pietersen.\n\"All I can add to what Andrew said is that we are aligned on the decision; myself, Andrew and Colin Graves.\n\"It has been a tricky issue that has been interpreted in different ways by different people.\n\"We are taking this as a chance to move forward with a new leadership with a real excitement about where English cricket can go.\"\nJonathan Agnew on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Anyone who will have seen Andrew Strauss talk today very strongly about the issue of trust, will be of no doubt that Kevin Pietersen will not play for England again.\"\nPiers Morgan on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I spoke to Kevin this morning and he's incredibly upset, he believes he's been deeply misled. Remove the personal, vindictive politics in the selection process and allow the best player to play for England again.\"\nFormer England bowler Steve Harmison told BBC Sport: \"I never expected Kevin to come back. I thought the decision to sack Kevin was baffling at the time. But I don't think this decision is baffling, because once you've sacked someone it is hard to come back.\n\"Andrew mentions the word trust, and I think that can work both ways. There were reports in the papers after their meeting on Monday and that can only have come from one place.\"\nFormer England and Kent batsman Ed Smith on Kevin Pietersen: \"Fans are not divided. Social media is divided and social media is a poor reflection of cricket.\"\nOn Andrew Strauss: \"Do you want someone to be interesting or good at their job?

There are 22 trade agreements between the EU and individual countries, and five multi-lateral agreements covering multiple countries.\nThis means that if the UK wants to retain preferential access to the markets of the 52 countries covered by these agreements, it would have to renegotiate trade deals with all of them.\nBritain is a large market, so there is a clear incentive for other countries to negotiate a deal. Advocates of Brexit argued that it would be in nobody's interest to interrupt the current trading partnerships.\nBut which of the other models discussed as potential post-Brexit options for the UK are realistic?\nRead more:\nThe UK's trade deal challenges\nReality Check: Who has access to the single market?\nReality Check: Would UK have to make new trade deals?\nReality Check: Could there be free trade without free movement?\nNorway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) - the single market - along with the 28 current EU members, Liechtenstein and Iceland.\nIn return for that access to the single market, it pays a contribution to the EU budget and has to sign up to all the rules of the club - including its common regulations and standards.\nPeople from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway too, but the country is exempt from EU rules on agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs. The downside for Norway is that it has no say over how the rules of the single market are created.\nSenior Leave campaigner and Tory leadership hopeful Boris Johnson wrote in the Telegraph on Sunday that the UK would continue to have access to the single market.\nBut would this be possible while also reducing immigration and cutting costs, as many Leave campaigners want?\nIreland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said the UK is unlikely to secure full access to the single market unless it continues to allow free movement of labour.\nAnd a senior German MP and ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Michael Fuchs, told the BBC that it would be possible for Britain to maintain access but at a price.\n\"The per capita fee of Norway is exactly the same as what Britain is now paying into the EU,\" he said. \"So there won't be any savings.\"\nHow Norway's relationship with the EU has split views\nSwitzerland has a free trade agreement with the EU and a number of agreements which give it access to the single market for most of its industries.\nBut it does not have full access to the single market for its banking sector and other parts of the services sector, which together make up almost 80% of the UK economy.\nIts agreement also requires the free movement of people.\nThe Swiss voted against joining the EEA in December 1992.\nInstead, the country, which sells over 50% of its exports to the EU, has agreed more than 120 bilateral agreements with Brussels, designed to secure Swiss access to Europe's markets.\nSwitzerland contributes billions of dollars to EU projects. Its bilateral deals are now in danger of unravelling over the question of free movement of people, after a referendum two years ago went in favour of restricting the number of workers arriving from the EU.\nWhile no such restriction has yet been implemented, Brussels retaliated swiftly, stalling agreements and freezing participation in education projects.\nCan Switzerland show UK route to Brexit?\nTurkey is not part of the EEA or the European Free Trade Association but does - like tiny Andorra and San Marino - have a customs union with the EU.\nThis means it faces no tariffs (taxes or duties on imports and exports) or quotas on industrial goods it sends to EU countries.\nThe customs union does not apply to agricultural goods, or services.\nTurkey also has no say on the tariffs it has to impose on goods it imports from non-EU countries, as it has to apply the EU's common external tariff to those goods (and is not involved in setting it).\nReality Check: Would the UK face tariffs outside the EU?\nFree trade area v single market - what's the difference?\nThe Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) between the EU and Canada is not yet in force, although it has been in the making for seven years.\nIt gives Canada preferential access to the EU single market without all the obligations that Norway and Switzerland face, eliminating most trade tariffs. However, some \"sensitive\" food items, including eggs and chicken, are not covered by it.\nCanadian exporters will have to prove that their goods are entirely \"made in Canada\", which imposes extra costs, to prevent imports entering the EU through a \"back door\".\nThe services sector is only partially covered by Ceta.\nCrucially, a Ceta-type deal would not give UK financial services the EU market access that they have now. It would be hard for London-based banks to get \"passporting\" rights for their services in the EU - rights that they value hugely now.\nIt would also mean that firms that export to the EU would have to comply with EU product standards and technical requirements without having any say in setting them.\nAnd critics of such a plan point out that the UK has a complex web of ties to the EU - much more than Canada.\nReality Check: Would Canada's deal with the EU be a good model for the UK?\nSome advocates of Brexit have said the UK should adopt a unilateral free trade policy - dropping all tariffs and relying on the World Trade Organisation's framework - as reported by the Financial Times.\nFor example Hong Kong's free trade policy means the Chinese special administrative region maintains no barriers on trade. The Hong Kong government says it \"does not charge tariff on importation or exportation of goods. Import and export licensing is also kept to a minimum.\"\nThis approach may have some appeal to Brexiteers whose ideology favours no trade restrictions.\nIt would be likely to gather less support from disaffected Labour voters and left-wing critics of the EU.\nNo tariffs of any kind could have a strongly negative effect on the UK's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, as importing goods such as food and steel would in many cases be cheaper than producing them in the UK.\nReality Check: Free trade free from regulation?\nViewpoint: Brexit puts UK on new economic path\nIf talks - with the EU and others - do not reach a deal before Brexit takes effect, trade rules would default to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\nThe UK and EU would be obliged to apply to each other the tariffs and other trade restrictions they apply to the rest of the world.\nThat is because the WTO rules allow countries to discriminate in favour of a trade partner only in a limited number of circumstances -

international comparison, carried out by Boston College, found the United States to have the highest number of sleep-deprived students, with 73% of 9 and 10-year-olds and 80% of 13 and 14-year-olds identified by their teachers as being adversely affected.\nIn literacy tests there were 76% of 9 and 10-year-olds lacking sleep.\nThis was much higher than the international average of 47% of primary pupils needing more sleep and 57% among the secondary age group.\nOther countries with the most sleep-deprived youngsters were New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Australia, England, Ireland and France. High-performing Finland is also among the most lacking in sleep.\nCountries with the best records for getting enough sleep include Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Japan and Malta.\nThe analysis was part of the huge data-gathering process for global education rankings - the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).\nFive things that stop you sleepingBBC World Service Business Daily podcast\nThese are among the biggest international benchmarks for education standards, based on tests taken by more than 900,000 pupils in primary and secondary schools in more than 50 countries and regional administrations.\nThe rankings of results for maths, science and reading were published at the end of last year, with Asian education systems dominating the top of the tables.\nBut the researchers also wanted to find out more about the influence of home life. There has been much analysis of the impact of family wealth and poverty, but the Boston College researchers also wanted to measure factors such as sleep and nutrition.\nSo the tests were accompanied by questionnaires for teachers, pupils and parents about sleep patterns. And this information was compared with pupils' test results, so that the performance in maths, science and literacy could be compared with levels of sleep.\n\"I think we underestimate the impact of sleep. Our data show that across countries internationally, on average, children who have more sleep achieve higher in maths, science and reading. That is exactly what our data show,\" says Chad Minnich, of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center.\n\"It's the same link for children who are lacking basic nutrition,\" says Mr Minnich, based at the Lynch School of Education, Boston College.\n\"If you are unable to concentrate, to attend mentally, you are unable to achieve at your optimal level, because your mind and body are in need of something more basic.\n\"Sleep is a fundamental need for all children. If teachers report such large proportions of children suffering from lack of sleep, it's having a significant impact.\n\"But worse than that, teachers are having to modify their instruction based on those children who are suffering from a lack of sleep.\n\"The children who are suffering from a lack of sleep are driving down instruction.\"\nThat means that even the children who are getting enough sleep are still suffering from this sleep-related dumbing-down.\nThe researchers uncovered regional trends that bucked expectations.\nAsian countries are the highest-performing in maths tests - and Mr Minnich says this has often been associated with long hours and cramming in after-school classes.\n\"One would assume that they would be extremely tired,\" he said. \"And yet when we look at the sleep factor for them, they don't necessarily seem to be suffering from as much sleep deprivation as the other countries.\"\nGetting a good night's sleep isn't going to transform an underperforming country into an education superpower. For instance, the least sleepy pupils seem to be in Azerbaijan, but they are still considerably behind the most sleep-deprived pupils in Finland.\nBut researchers say that it does show how differently individual pupils might be placed on the ability spectrum, with lack of sleep representing the difference between being high-performing and average.\nThere are also big changes as pupils get older. Younger pupils in South Korea have among the lowest levels of sleep deprivation in the world, but in secondary school they have some of the worst problems.\nThere are differences within countries too. At the level of US states, among secondary pupils Colorado has a much worse problem with lack of sleep than Massachusetts.\nWhat the study does not show is why young people are missing out on sleep - or why more technologically advanced countries seem to have the biggest difficulties.\nBut sleep experts point to a particular problem due to technology in children's bedroom - specifically the use of screens on smartphones or laptops late at night.\nIt isn't only that young people are kept awake by messaging their friends or using the internet. The light from the screen, held close to the face, is physically disruptive to the natural onset of sleep.\n\"Having a computer screen that is eight inches away from your face is going to expose you to a lot more light than watching a television on the opposite side of the room,\" says Karrie Fitzpatrick, sleep researcher at Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\"It's going to tell your brain to stay awake,\" says Dr Fitzpatrick.\n\"That light can reset the whole circadian rhythm system and say, 'Wait a minute, it's not time to go to bed'.\"\nLack of sleep is also a serious physical barrier to learning.\n\"Sleepiness is a problem at all stages that are relevant to learning, memory and academic performance,\" says Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the Sleep Research Centre at the University of Surrey.\nResearch into sleep disorders and brain function has shown the importance of sleep in memory and consolidating information.\nWithout sleep, the brain struggles to absorb and retain ideas.\n\"There is a growing interest in the associations between adequate sleep and academic performance,\" says Prof Dijk.\nDr Fitzpatrick says lack of sleep is going to leave pupils more emotionally volatile, more potentially disruptive and physically struggling to learn.\nAnd she says that the loss of sleep and short-term attempts to catch up can cause further and complex disruptions to the way the brain tries to store information.\nBut there is good news. If you start getting enough sleep on a regular basis, the loss to learning can be reversed.\n\"As long you haven't gone into extreme sleep deprivation, if you go back to seven to nine hours per night, as long as there has been no permanent damage, you can probably restore the functionality of accumulating, processing and being able to recall memories,\" says Dr Fitzpatrick.\n\"The basis of learning will likely be restored to normal levels.\"\nOtherwise trying to study without sleep is going to be tough. \"Your brain is running on empty.\"", "summary": "Sleep deprivation is a significant hidden factor in lowering the achievement of school pupils, according to researchers carrying out international education tests.", "id": "22209818", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

And it will continue to do so for many years to come.\nThe challenge, then, is how to harness coal's energy more cleanly. While global attempts to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) have stalled, a number of countries are looking at different ways to exploit their abundant coal reserves.\nNot all are motivated by environmental concerns, but are driven instead by economics and a desire for energy independence.\nThe main technology being used is coal gasification - instead of burning the fossil fuel, it is chemically transformed into synthetic natural gas (SNG).\nThe process is decades old, but recent rises in the price of gas mean it is now more economically viable. The US has dabbled in the technique, but China is going all out in a bid to satisfy its soaring demand for power and reduce its dependency on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nThe country's National Energy Administration has laid out plans to produce 50 billion cubic metres of gas from coal by 2020, enough to satisfy more than 10% of China's total gas demand.\nHow American energy independence could change the world\nShale industry faces reality check\nGerman coal underpins renewable push\nNot only does it make economic sense, but it allows China to exploit stranded coal deposits sitting thousands of kilometres from the country's main industrial centres. Transporting gas is, after all, a lot cheaper than transporting coal.\nCoal gasification can also help address local pollution problems that have in recent months brought parts of the country to a virtual standstill.\nBut there are two big problems. First, coal gasification actually produces more CO2 than a traditional coal plant; so not only will China be using more coal, it will be doing so at a greater cost to the environment.\nAs Laszlo Varro, head of gas, coal and power markets at the International Energy Agency (IEA), says: \"[Coal gasification] is attractive from an economic and energy security perspective.\n\"It can be a nice solution to local pollution, but its overall carbon intensity is worse [than coal mining], so it is not attractive at all from a climate change point of view\".\nIndeed a study by Duke University in the US suggests synthetic natural gas emits seven times more greenhouse gases than natural gas, and almost twice as much carbon as a coal plant.\nThe second problem is water use. Coal gasification is one of the more water-intensive forms of energy production, and large areas of China, particularly in the western parts of the country that would host new gasification plants, already suffer from water shortages.\nMr Varro says a recent IEA report concluded that coal and coal gasification plants would use \"quite a substantial portion of the available water in China\".\nOther countries are looking at different ways to get gas from coal. One method, particularly popular in Australia, is coal-bed methane, a process allowing access to coal deposits that are too deep to mine. Water is sucked out of the seam and the methane attached to the surface of the coal is freed and then collected.\nChina, Indonesia and Mozambique are looking at coal-bed methane, while the US and Canada also have abundant reserves.\nVery little CO2 is emitted, but the process is not without controversy. Opponents highlight concerns about water contamination, land subsidence and disposing of waste water safely, while the water intensive process sometimes involves fracking.\nAnd yet coal-bed methane has \"fundamentally changed the dynamics of the gas industry in Australia,\" according to Phil Hirschhorn, partner at the Boston Consulting Group's energy practice in Sydney.\nHe says there are 200 trillion cubic feet of coal-bed methane resources in the country, with projects under construction to liquify and export 25 million tonnes of gas every year - equivalent to 10% of the entire global LNG market.\nA very different way to produce gas from coal is known as underground coal gasification (UCG), a process that has been around since the 19th Century but which has yet to become commercially viable on a grand scale - there is currently one working facility in Uzbekistan and pilot projects in Australia and South Africa.\nAccording to Julie Lauder, chief executive of the UCG Association, the process is a \"new way of harnessing the energy of coal without the usual environmental impacts\".\nTechnological developments and the rising price of gas mean UCG is now a feasible way of accessing the vast resources of coal that are too deep to mine, she says. Indeed, estimates suggest that as much as 85% of the world's coal resources cannot be accessed through traditional mining techniques.\nOpening them up to exploitation has potentially disastrous implications for CO2 emissions and climate change, but the industry says these resources can be accessed cleanly.\nThe process involves pumping oxygen and steam through a small borehole into the coal seam to produce a small and controlled combustion. Unlike coal-bed methane, therefore, the actual coal is converted from a solid state into gas. The hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and CO2 are then siphoned off through a second borehole.\nAccording to Dr Harry Bradbury, founder and chief executive of UK clean energy company Five Quarters, this process results in 20% of the CO2 produced from traditional coal mining.\nBut his company is developing a process that requires no burning of coal, and which combines what Dr Bradbury calls \"solid state chemical engineering\" with releasing gases that are trapped not just in the coal, but in the surrounding rocks as well. And all of this takes place offshore, relieving concerns about water contamination and subsidence, he argues.\nBut the real advantage lies in the ability to capture the CO2. \"We need to get more radical - we need to get to zero carbon,\" Dr Bradbury says. \"Full carbon capture and storage is absolutely crucial.\"\nThis can take place through re-injecting the CO2 back into the coal seams, or by converting the carbon into products such as plastics and graphene, he says.\nThe UK government has established a working party to investigate the merits of UCG, undoubtedly excited by the vast resources of coal sitting under the North Sea. Other governments are equally keen to exploit new technologies to access their hidden coal seams.\nThe problem, of course, is that the process depends entirely on wider efforts to develop CCS, efforts that have, so far, singularly failed to find a solution.\nUntil one is found, any attempts to gasify coal underground will either remain theoretical or will exacerbate the already grave problem of CO2 emissions.

Playing as captain and centre-back was only the beginning, as he impressed with a nice threaded pass to set up Griffiths for his fourth goal in two games - the striker springing a half-hearted Killie offside trap before calmly slotting in to give his team a 3-0 lead at the break.\nTierney then sent a 40-yard screamer high into the top corner for Celtic's fourth. It was a terrific strike that the man, already capped four times for Scotland, will struggle to better in what promises to be a bright future.\nThe busy Hayes scampered down the right for his second assist of the night, sending an inviting low cross for Armstrong to side-foot home from close-range.\nOne negative for Celtic was a nasty looking injury for Kouassi, who was taken off after jarring what looked like his knee or ankle.\nMatch ends, Celtic 5, Kilmarnock 0.\nSecond Half ends, Celtic 5, Kilmarnock 0.\nAttempt missed.

Despite reductions brought about by measures such as nets or spraying homes with insecticides, it continues to kill hundreds of thousands of people annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe idea of using a \"sex-distorting\" genetic defect to control pest populations was proposed over 60 years ago, but this is the first time it has been practically demonstrated.\nThe researchers, led by Prof Andrea Crisanti and Dr Nikolai Windbichler of Imperial College London, transferred a gene from a slime mould into the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. This gene produces an enzyme called an \"endonuclease\" which chops up DNA when it recognises a particular sequence.\nProf Crisanti said his team exploited a \"fortuitous coincidence\": the target sequence of that endonuclease is found specifically - and abundantly - on the mosquito's X chromosome. \"In Anopheles gambiae, all 350 copies are together, side-by-side on the X chromosome,\" he told BBC News.\nWhen sperm are produced normally, in mosquitoes or in humans, 50% contain an X chromosome and 50% a Y chromosome. When they fuse with an egg these produce female and male embryos, respectively.\nIn the new mosquitoes, the X-attacking endonuclease is turned on specifically during sperm formation. As a result,  the males produce almost no X-containing sperm - or female offspring. More than 95% of their progeny are male.\nImportantly this change is heritable, so that male mosquitoes pass it on to about half their male progeny. This means if the artificial strain is released into a population - in the lab or in the wild - the trait can spread until most males are only producing male offspring, perhaps eradicating the population altogether.\n\"It can be a self-sustaining effect,\" said Dr Windbichler.\nIndeed, in five test cages that started with 50 males and 50 females, when the team introduced 150 of their new sex-distorter males, the number of females plummeted within four generations. After another couple of generations, in four out of five cages, the population died out entirely.\nBoth these effects are beneficial, Prof Crisanti explained, because only female mosquitoes bite humans and spread malaria. So a drop in female numbers might slow its spread, while a population crash could \"break the cycle\" of malaria transmission.\nDr Luke Alphey founded the company Oxitec to develop genetic control strategies for harmful insects and has pioneered the use of GM mosquitoes to help control dengue fever. He told the BBC the new research was exciting, but suggested that if used in the wild, this particular sex-distorter strain might not spread indefinitely and would need to be \"topped up\".\nFor a really successful, spreading system to eradicate malaria mosquitoes, \"You'd have to get such a system expressed on the Y chromosome,\" Dr Alphey said.\nThe new study's authors agree this would be much more powerful. \"You'd need to release fewer individuals, because all males will inherit the gene from their fathers and pass it on to all their sons - so the effect would not be diluted,\" said Dr Windbichler.\n\"Theoretically, if you have it on the Y,\" Prof Crisanti added, \"one single individual could knock out an entire population.\"\nIn fact, Dr Windbichler and Prof Crisanti showed in another recent paper that this type of gene insertion on the mosquito Y chromosome is perfectly achievable.\n\"They haven't yet put it all together,\" Dr Alphey commented, \"but all the pieces are in place.\"\nDr Alphey also commented that the power of that proposed technique would pose additional questions for researchers and regulators. \"In principle, what you get is extinction,\" he said.\n\"Humans have undoubtedly driven a very large number of species to extinction - but we've only deliberately done it with two: smallpox and rinderpest. Would we want to do that with Anopheles gambiae?\"\nDr Alphey's answer to his own question appears to be \"maybe\".\n\"If this species were to suffer a population crash, it's hard to see how significant negative side-effects might arise,\" he explained. \"The mosquitoes are not keystone species in their ecosystems. And this technique only affects one species, Anopheles gambiae, among more than 3,000 known species of mosquitoes.\"\n\"If we rely instead on pesticide control we would likely kill non-malarial mosquitoes and many other insects besides. The genetic approach is much more precise.\"\nCrisanti and Windbichler think that extinction is unlikely, even with the proposed Y chromosome-driven system, but agree that caution is warranted. \"There are a lot of tests to run through,\" Dr Windbichler said.\n\"We are still a couple of years from this being applied in the field. It's very promising but there's still a long way to go.\"\nDr Michael Bonsall, a reader in zoology at the University of Oxford, said the new research was \"super cool\" and demonstrated \"just how important these sorts of GM technologies are at reducing insect vector population sizes.\"\n\"This has important implications for limiting the spread of malaria,\" Dr Bonsall said, though he also noted that it was \"a long way from being deployed.\"\nTo begin testing the safety and efficacy of the sex-distorter strains on a bigger scale, Prof Crisanti's team has built a large facility in Italy. \"We have big, contained cages in which we can reproduce a tropical environment - and we can test several hypotheses on a very large scale.\"\nMeanwhile, he and his colleagues are pleased to have developed such a promising genetic weapon against malaria using the elusive sex-distortion mechanism, proposed many years ago.\n\"One of the first people to suggest it was the famous British biologist Bill Hamilton, while he was actually here at Imperial as a lecturer for a while,\" commented Dr Windbichler. \"So it was theorised 60 years ago, but never put in practice.\"\nThe Life Scientific, broadcast at 9am on Tuesday 10th June, featured malaria researcher Professor Janet Hemingway.", "summary": "Scientists have created mosquitoes that produce 95% male offspring, with the aim of helping control malaria.", "id": "27765974", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Life Scientific, broadcast at 9am on Tuesday 10th June, featured malaria researcher Professor Janet Hemingway.\nPlease summarize context above:\nThe Life Scientific, broadcast at 9am on Tuesday 10th June, featured malaria researcher Professor Janet Hemingway.

They were accurate and threatening - all of the things that Aberdeen were not. The Dons were lamentably bad; their midfield was bossed and their use of the ball was dreadful. They were fortunate not to be behind at the break.\nThey could thank Joe Lewis for that. When Joe Garner's 27th minute shot deflected viciously off Shay Logan it looked like it was going to end up in Aberdeen's net. Lewis did marvellously to adjust his position and claw it away at the last second.\nAberdeen were passive and Rangers were comfortable. The problem for them is that they failed to make their dominance pay. Seven goals from six league games before this one suggests that this is a team that is missing cutting edge.\nDons manager Derek McInnes Derek McInnes replaced Peter Pawlett with Maddison at half-time in an effort to address the imbalance in midfield. What an influence he would have later.\nOnly 20 seconds had gone in the second half before life got a whole lot better for the Dons.

And, bizarrely, it was Aberdeen's most dangerous player who was culpable.\nHayes grabbed a fistful of Wallace's shirt, taking down the visiting captain, and Halliday put away the penalty for a deserved equaliser.\nWith the game in its dying minutes, Aberdeen won a free-kick 25 yards from goal when Tavernier was judged to have brought down Hayes. Later, Rangers manager Mark Warburton railed against the decision, saying that Tavernier had taken the ball in an excellent tackle. McInnes, unsurprisingly, disagreed.\nWhat was beyond argument was the beauty of Maddison's effort. The 19-year-old on loan from Norwich, stood over it and proceeded to launch the most sumptuous strike over the defensive wall and into the net via the inside of Wes Foderingham's left-hand post. Stunning.\nFor Aberdeen, a hugely important win achieved on a day when they failed to produce anything like their best stuff. It's been a big week for the Dons, who reached the League Cup semi-finals on Thursday with another last-gasp goal.\nFor Rangers - deep frustration because they deserved more.

It was the same format in 1995.\nSince 1998, however, it has been held as a tournament every two years, with eight teams taking part. Cameroon is hosting this one, the 10th edition.\nTeams are divided into two groups of four, with the top two sides advancing straight to the semi-finals.\nCameroon, who have never won the competition, qualified as hosts and were joined by Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Egypt, debutants Kenya and Mali, who replaced Equatorial Guinea after they were disqualified for fielding a player using fraudulent documents.\nNigeria are the continent's dominant force. Only one other nation, Equatorial Guinea, has won this tournament, coming out on top in both 2008 and 2012.\nThe tournament is being staged in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital city, and Limbe, in the west of the country.\nThe locals have embraced it, with tickets priced competitively between 1,000 and 5,000 Central African Francs (\u00a31.30 to \u00a36.45).\nStade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde has sold out and will be cacophonous, thanks to the vuvuzelas, beating drums, screeching whistles, cheers of the crowd and the sound of seats shuffling from the many Mexican Waves.\nHelen Mgoh, a local journalist working for National radio broadcaster CRTV, says Cameroonians have been \"clamouring for some good football\" because the men have been performing poorly for a long time.\n\"These women have been putting the action out there on the turf and we're just loving it,\" adds Ngoh.\nIt's a sentiment echoed by Cameroon's assistant coach and former captain Bernadette Anong, who says she has never experienced an atmosphere like it.\nEven the stadium in Limbe has been close to full for the the likes of Nigeria and Egypt, who are making only their second appearance at the tournament.\n\"I never imagined people would be that interested in women's football,\" says Egypt player Esraa Osama.\n\"I have been playing professionally for 14 years and it's the first time I felt what a male footballer must feel - and it is thanks to the fans.\"\nEnow Ngachu, one of the longest-serving coaches of women's football in Africa, has been in charge of Cameroon since 2004, guiding them to their first Olympic Games in 2012 and first World Cup in 2015.\nHe believes the standard of female football has \"increased a lot\" in Africa.\nAt his team's press conference ahead of the final, he was also quick to comment on the packed press room, a sight he reckoned he had never experienced in African women's football before.\nKenya may have lost all three group games in their first Nations Cup but their coach insists it has been a positive experience for his players.\n\"When they go home, they will know what level they need to push their club team-mates to reach,\" says David Ouma.\nBut it is what happens after the tournament that is crucial for the development of women's football in Africa.\nPlayers like South Africa's Janine Van Wyk have already appealed for more international matches because African teams struggle to get games against the world's top sides outside of the major events.\nIn fact, 14 of the 40 women's teams in Africa have not played enough international matches to even qualify for a Fifa ranking.\nDomestic leagues, even in the strongholds of Nigeria and Cameroon, are often fractured or suspended, too, while lack the financial support from football associations and sponsors is also a hindrance.\nNigeria, or the Super Falcons, face Cameroon, also known as the Indomitable Lionesses, on Saturday in Yaounde (14:30 BST) in a repeat of the 2014 final in Namibia, which the Nigerians won 2-0.\nCameroon have yet to win the tournament but their defence has been rock solid in this edition and they've yet to concede a goal. Scoring has been trickier, though. Despite dominating games, their finishing has been poor.\nTheir big star is 24-year-old striker Gaelle Enganamouit. Her face adorns many billboards but the 2016 BBC Women's Footballer of the Year nominee is just back from a lengthy injury and has yet to find the net in this tournament.\n\"She's had so much pressure on her,\" says Ngoh. \"She really wants to score and when she doesn't you can see her frustration. She knows the public are willing her to score. When it doesn't happen, it adds to the pressure.\"\nNigeria are the favourites on Saturday and, despite facing a very vocal home crowd, their coach and former captain Florence Omagbemi is in upbeat mood.\n\"Mentally, physically, psychologically, we are ready for the game on Saturday,\" she says. \"We have experienced players that can deal with any situation.\"\nOmagbemi has reason to be confident. Her team are the top scorers, with Arsenal's Asisat Oshoala claiming six of their 12 goals.\n----------------\nNigeria's path to the final:\nGroup games: Beat Mali 6-1; Drew 1-1 with Ghana; Beat Kenya 4-0.\nSemi-final: Beat South Africa 1-0.\nCameroon's path to the final:\nGroup games: Beat Egypt 2-0; Beat South Africa 1-0; Beat Zimbabwe 2-0.\nSemi-final: Beat Ghana 1-0.\n----------------\nJournalist Mimi Fawaz, who follows Nigeria for Africa Vox TV, expects Cameroon to target Oshoala to stop her finding the net but says the team have other threats, like Ucheci Sunday, Desire Oparanozie and Francisca Ordega.\n\"They used the long ball effectively against South Africa in their semi-final and they could use this again on Saturday,\" adds Fawaz.\nNigeria have never lost in the final of the Nations Cup, claiming seven wins in nine tournaments. Two other titles came their way when the competition was played over a calendar year rather than a two-week event.\nFor Cameroon, Saturday might feel like deja vu. They have lost three times in the final - with all those defeats coming at the hands of Nigeria.\nThere will be updates from Sarah and the World Service team from 15:00 BST.", "summary": "Nigeria have had an almost vice-like grip on the Women's Africa Cup of Nations but will face determined hosts Cameroon in Saturday's final.", "id": "38185232", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n\"Nigeria are the favourites on Saturday and, despite facing a very vocal home crowd, their coach and former captain Florence Omagbemi is in upbeat mood.\n\"Omagbemi has reason to be confident.

Donald Trump wants to renegotiate it or pull America out of it.\nBecause the US has the world's largest economy, and is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, the outcome of this struggle will reverberate internationally. If the US leaves the Paris Agreement, the painfully-negotiated deal could unravel.\nWith such sharply opposing perspectives, this is the first presidential contest in which the candidates are highlighting their stances on global warming and energy, and using them to attack each other.\nSo how is this playing out in a swing state like Ohio, which hosts some of America's oldest coalfields and one of the most innovative solar panel makers?\nThrough the east of the state, the mighty Ohio River flows like an artery for the coal industry, with the heavy machinery of mines, loading stations and power plants lining the steep green banks.\nFor more than a century, this has been a crucible of power production for the US economy, with vast quantities of coal burned to generate electricity. And because the jobs paid well, and there were lots of them, the communities thrived.\nBut in recent years, fortunes have changed. The pollution belching from the smokestacks has been gradually limited by wave after wave of legislation - first on emissions of sulphur dioxide, then of nitrogen dioxide, and now of carbon dioxide.\nIt's no surprise, but along this valley the Environmental Protection Agency is held in contempt. This is the body responsible for cleaning up the air and reducing greenhouse gases under President Obama's Clean Power Plan. A key Trump promise is to dismantle both the agency and the plan.\nThe reality is that environmental regulation is not the only challenge to coal. Another has come from fracking, the revolution that's opened up deep layers of shale rock to release new supplies of plentiful gas that's cheaper and cleaner than coal.\nIn any event, the result is that demand for coal is falling and the mines have long been in trouble. As many as 50 mining companies have filed for bankruptcy.\nAt one pit head, a dozen blackened faces emerged from a lift - this was the day shift, about half the size it would normally have been. Cuts are taking their toll. The mine will close by the end of the year.\nHere, Hillary Clinton is a hate figure. A newspaper cutting, pinned to a wall, highlights her saying \"We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"\nShe later clarified that comment. What she meant to say was that the switch to cleaner energy would inevitably mean coal closures and that she wants to support communities making the transition. But the damage was done.\nI talked to the mine's owner, one of the leading figures in the coal industry, Robert Murray of the Murray Energy Corporation.\nAn outspoken defender of US coal, and prominent in launching legal challenges against the Clean Power Plan, he followed his father into the mines and keeps a polished lump of coal in his board-room.\nWhile many coal mining companies declined our requests for interviews, Mr Murray jumped at the chance, and there was no holding him back.\n\"What happens is when two coal miners get laid off, if they own anything it's their homes and, when they get laid off, they have no one to sell their homes to.\n\"So those people who just want to work in honour and dignity are denied that, and it's not the America that I cherish\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That's why I speak out like I do, that's why I say, Obama is a greater scourge than America has ever had in its history.\"\nDonald Trump would agree with all that. He sees coal as abundant and homegrown, and responsible for thousands of jobs. And he talks of revitalising the industry, which goes down very well in mining country.\nThe fact that it is the dirtiest fossil fuel is irrelevant in the Trump view because global warming is a \"hoax\" as he once called it, though he later said that was a joke.\nSo what about the alternative vision?\nOnly a hundred miles to the west, there's a very different Ohio. The zoo in the city of Toledo has solar panels covering its walkways. The huge roof of the city's famous Museum of Art is shining with them too.\nWith many major companies like Wal-Mart investing in renewable power, the sight of solar installations in this notoriously gas-guzzling nation is no longer so unusual.\nOn the edge of Toledo, in a landscaped business park, stand the sleek buildings of First Solar. A gigantic manufacturing hall is busy with robots and people working side-by-side. Together with a larger sister plant in southeast Asia, this company can boast of a remarkable statistic: it churns out a new solar panel every single second.\nThe executives do not want to be drawn into talking politics but they argue that we are witnessing a fundamental transformation: not only have solar panels increased in efficiency but they have also tumbled in price.\nNo longer is solar just a fad for the eco-conscious rich. The largest solar installations - \"utility-scale\" in the jargon - in the sunniest parts of the US can generate electricity that is comparable in cost to that of coal.\nThough solar power is still intermittent, as with wind, the fall in cost does mean that during the hot days of high summer, when air-conditioning is running at full blast, the electricity supply can be carbon-free.\nThe implication is that solar power may be starting to make sense purely on financial grounds, regardless of any other motivation such as aiming to reduce carbon emissions.\nAt the state's largest solar array, covering a long rolling field, Bill Spratley of Green Energy Ohio, a renewables advocacy group, told me that the new reality of cheaper renewable energy would change the debate.\n\"We have some politicians that are fighting the last war, they're fighting over something, they still believe solar is in the future but it's here now.\n\"We've probably passed the tipping point or the turning point and they just don't know it yet.\"\nIf solar costs keep falling, and coal continues to be undermined by shale gas, then it may be that a Trump victory would not do much to alter what could be an historic trend away from coal into cleaner sources of energy. Even outside the Paris Agreement, US energy companies and big corporations may still see logic in making the switch.\nAs we leave the solar farm, an engineer managing the installation joined the conversation. \"Solar makes sense to me,\" he said, \"and I'm a Republican\".", "summary": "Two starkly different visions of global warming are offered by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in their race for the White House.", "id": "37034052", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "an historic trend away from coal into cleaner sources of energy.

These were socialists from all over Europe, meeting to discuss ways to bring peace to a continent ravaged by World War One.\nTwo of the most famous participants were Russian: Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, or Lenin, and Leon Trotsky.\nTheir peace campaign made secrecy necessary: opposing the war was viewed as treason in many countries.\nLenin and Trotsky were already political refugees. They were both living in neutral Switzerland - Trotsky in Geneva and Lenin in Berne, quietly planning the overthrow of Tsarist Russia.\nToday, Zimmerwald is not much changed from that day in 1915.\nIt is a sleepy little place, population 1,100, with a few farms, a church, and the Alps soaring majestically across the valley.\nAnd for 100 years there was no sign that the founders of the Bolshevik Revolution had ever set foot there.\nThousands of kilometres to the east, however, Zimmerwald gradually became famous.\nIn classrooms across the Soviet Union, the village was being celebrated as the birthplace of the revolution.\n\"In the Soviet Union, Zimmerwald was such a famous place. Every Soviet school child knew about Zimmerwald,\" explained Julia Richers, a historian at Berne University.\n\"But you can ask any Swiss school child, they would never know what Zimmerwald was about.\"\nJulia describes Switzerland's attitude to its history as a kind of \"forceful forgetting\", especially in Zimmerwald itself, where, in the 1960s, plans to have a small plaque marking Lenin's presence were formally banned by the village council.\nSwitzerland's neutrality probably lies at the root of that reluctance to acknowledge the past.\nDuring the Cold War the Swiss were extremely nervous about showing overt friendliness to either East or West, and spent billions on a vast army and on bunkers for every family, in the hope of sitting, neutrally, out of any future conflict.\nBut in Zimmerwald, reminders of Lenin's presence were dropping through the letter box every day.\nMayor Fritz Broennimann has a vast archive of earnest missives: postcards, drawings, and notes, from hundreds of Soviet schoolchildren, many of them addressed to the \"President of Zimmerwald\", all begging for information about their national hero Lenin.\n\"They asked for photographs, for booklets,\" he explained, showing a fraying postcard of a Lenin statue in Moscow.\n\"Some even sent their letters to the Lenin museum in Zimmerwald.\"\nOf course, there was no museum, and there were no photographs or booklets.\nMost of those letters were never answered.\nBut occasionally a Zimmerwald official, perhaps made anxious by the excessive amount of mail with Soviet stamps landing on his desk, tried to stem the flow.\nAnd so, in 1945, this firm reply was sent:\n\"Sir, I have not been briefed on your political sympathies. However, I am not inclined to provide material to a political extremist, which could then be of use to enemies of the state.\"\nEven in this centenary year, Zimmerwald has wrestled with the apparently agonising decision over whether to mark it.\n\"We had an idea [for an article] - 'A hundred years, a hundred opinions',\" explained Mayor Broennimann.\n\"So we put an advertisement in the local paper. We got about six answers.\"\nBut just a few kilometres north of Zimmerwald in the Swiss capital Berne - one of the most left-leaning of Switzerland's cities - the significance of the Zimmerwald conference is getting a good deal of attention.\n\"Zimmerwald was actually a peace conference,\" said Fabian Molina, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists party.\n\"They were young leftists from the whole of Europe, discussing peace, discussing their strategy against war.\"\n\"A hundred years after Zimmerwald, we are in a similar situation, if we compare the wars that are going on, with 60 million people fleeing.\n\"We have a refugee crisis, it reminds us how violent the world is, and so it's important to remember there was once a conference of people uniting for peace.\"\nHistorian Julia Richers agrees, pointing out that the conference was the only gathering in Europe against the war, and that the final manifesto from Zimmerwald contained some fundamental principles.\n\"The Zimmerwald manifesto stated three important things,\" she explained. \"That there should be a peace without annexations, a peace without war contributions, and the self-determination of people.\n\"If you look at the peace treaties of World War One, those three things were hardly considered, and we know that World War One led partially to the World War Two, and so I think the manifesto did state some very important points for a peaceful Europe.\"\nA little-known fact is that that manifesto was not revolutionary enough for Lenin and Trotsky, who wanted it to contain references to replacing war between nations with an armed class struggle.\nTheir fellow socialists and social democrats in Zimmerwald outvoted them, but Lenin continued to harbour hopes that Switzerland might be fertile ground for staging a revolution.\n\"He once stated that the Swiss could have been the most revolutionary of all, because almost everybody had a gun at home,\" said Julia Richers.\n\"But he said that in the end the society was too bourgeois\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so he gave up on the Swiss.\"\n\"I think he recognised after a few years that it was not a good idea to start a revolution in Switzerland,\" laughed Fabian Molina.\n\"Switzerland has always been a quite right-wing country, it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 never had a left majority, and I think Lenin saw that the revolutionary potential here in Switzerland was quite small.\"\nBut back in Zimmerwald, that historic conference, and its most famous participants, have finally received some modest recognition.\nOn the spot where the hotel Lenin stayed in once stood (it was pulled down in the 1960s to make way for a bus stop) are two small signs.\nMade only of plywood and cardboard, they will not last once winter begins, Fritz Broennimann admits, but they do at least commemorate the events of 1915.\nAnd, after much discussion, the village held a memorial event, with speeches by historians and politicians.\nIt took place in the local church which, Mr Broennimann remarks with a wry smile, \"was full for a change\".\nAnd Lenin? He carried on living in Berne, where he wrote some of his most important political treatises.\nIn 1916 he moved to Zurich, and in early 1917 he took the famous train from Zurich to St Petersburg, which was teetering on the edge of revolution.\nThe rest, as they say, is history.", "summary": "On a crisp autumn day in 1915, 38 ornithologists gathered in the tiny Swiss village of Zimmerwald.", "id": "34799462", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

It was in 2006 or 2007 that overcrowding became clear,\" he said.\n\"It was perhaps rising fuel costs, congestion, people wanting to do their bit for the environment. That's when it started going up and there was no plan for this.\n\"People in Cardiff are not used to being mass transited. They won't cwtch [cuddle] up with everyone like on the Piccadilly line at 8:30.\"\nPart of the solution is using bigger trains - with Prof Cole giving an example of the impact of Intercity 125s, each capable of carrying 1,000 people, waiting to ferry the 45,000 rugby day crowds in a bid to keep queues to a minimum.\nA proposed new electrified Metro system should also help with speed - currently, about six trains an hour go through Llandaf station, compared to about 11 on many London underground routes.\nHowever, Prof Cole believes a bigger issue is getting rising numbers of passengers on to platforms safely.\n\"It was never designed for mass transit. It's not a commuter railway station, so it's not even fair to say it's the contractor's fault,\" he said.\n\"It was built for a different era, for mainline trains and a few other local trains.\"\nProf Cole believes a new platform eight, opening in 2017, plus improved signalling will help.\nBut he claimed the area around the station had been developed with no overarching travel plan - saying a new bus station being built will be \"world class\" but \"not big enough\".\nEmployers will also have a big responsibility, with 4,000 tax office workers on flexi-time, for example, reducing rush hour pressures.\nAnd while ambitious plans have been unveiled for redeveloping central station, Prof Cole said they do not address a major issue.\n\"Network Rail want a nice mall and frontage. It would be good, especially if it extended to the BBC building, as it would allow people to stand undercover after events,\" he said.\n\"It's very pretty, but the key thing is capacity - and new platforms are needed.\"\nWith little available land, Prof Cole believes a proposed redevelopment of the Brains Brewery site behind the station holds the key.\nWhen negotiating planning permission, it is not unusual for developers to offer 10% of land value as a contribution to improvement schemes, called a Section 106 agreement.\nProf Cole said \"there is a deal to be done\" and if land was requested instead, new platforms could be built.\nWhile SA Brain is still months away from submitting a planning application, could the idea be a possibility?\nThe proposal is a joint venture with Rightacres and its chief executive Paul McCarthy said: \"The timing for bringing forward the Brain's site ties in perfectly with the Metro system delivery programme.\n\"Public transport is pivotal to the success of any business district and to have a Metro terminal at Central Quay, adjacent to the central train station, would be good for all concerned.\"\nCardiff council said it is \"actively engaged\" with Network Rail, the Welsh Government and developers to find ways to improve the station.\nA spokesman said: \"It's essential that the ongoing regeneration of Central Square is reinforced by the regeneration of central station and the leader of the city council continues to press the case for investment.\"\nCommuter Andrew Jones from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, has already given up on the rail network.\n\"I could never get a seat on the train despite paying \u00a320 a week,\" he said.\n\"It's easier to get here myself. I now bring my bike, which costs \u00a315 a week and takes 15 minutes not 30.\"\nOne of Central Square's first tenant's - law firm Blake Morgan has moved in and employee Fiona MacDonald said the train from Lisvane and Thornhill is \"fine\" at 07:30 GMT.\nHowever, this may not be the experience for commuters on the same line later in rush hour.\nGavin Davies, 31, who travels from Mountain Ash, said the journey is usually manageable, but adding Christmas shoppers into the mix has illustrated the pressures more people create.\n\"If you can't buy your ticket on the train, you buy it at central [station] to get through the barrier. But there was a queue from the one end right to the back,\" he said.\n\"I put it down to the time of year, but new developments won't help.\"\nTim James, Network Rail's head of strategy and planning in Wales, said work around the station is positive and co-ordinating activities will be \"extremely important\".\n\"We will need to refresh our [passenger] forecasts regularly to take into account any new developments in the immediate vicinity of the station,\" he added.\nWhile admitting money is not currently available, Mr James said Cardiff council is helping it look at funding options for developing Cardiff Central.\nHe added: \"We are particularly keen to leverage more commercial funding as a contribution towards delivering improvements for passengers and we are developing options to look at a range of possible solutions.\"", "summary": "Cardiff Central railway station was built \"for a different era\" and will not be able to cope with a rise in commuters, a travel expert has warned.", "id": "38391608", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "The article is about the Cardiff Central train station.

Even if we didn't win today we depend on us.\n\"We never talk about the teams near us, we are talking all the time to try and win the next game.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez:\n\"It is very disappointing, we didn't do what we had to today, we made too many mistakes.\n\"We gave them chances at the beginning. After we started the second half much better we had chances and were on top of them, then we gave a silly foul and gave a goal away from it.\n\"We didn't manage the situation the way we have to. We had some chances at the end and their keeper was making saves.\n\"We have to wake up and be ready for the next game.

Lower rates make it harder for banks to make a profit but that's less of a problem for HSBC with its large overseas interests, than it is for the domestic banks.\nIan Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, says most of HSBC's business is outside the UK, including the US, where interest rates are forecast to rise.\nRoyal Bank of Scotland, in comparison, is an \"almost pure UK business and 'lower for longer' interest rates is a UK phenomenon,\" he says.\nAlso working in HSBC's favour, Mr Gordon adds, is that the bank is handing back $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) to shareholders this year after it sold its Brazilian business.\nThe biggest winners, though? Mining companies. Something of a surprise for investors after the industry's volatility in the last 12 months.\nEdward Sterck, a metals and mining analyst at BMO Capital Markets, says: \"This time last year mining investors were feeling pretty negative, and in January many were feeling very negative indeed.\n\"Sitting here today they are pretty buoyant.\"\nMexican gold and silver miner Fresnillo's shares have risen 46%, putting it top of the post-Brexit leaderboard. Swiss mining trader Glencore is up 39% and British miner Anglo American has also gained 39%.\nThe companies' large foreign earnings, as well as rising metal prices, have helped turn around their fortunes.\nGold and silver have increased 6% and 12% respectively since the referendum. Seen as \"safe haven\" assets, they have been boosted by uncertainty in global financial markets and rock-bottom interest rates, two issues further intensified by the Brexit vote.\nAt the other end of the scale, the biggest loser on the blue chip index has been budget airline Easyjet.\nIts shares are still down more than 34%, leaving the Luton-based firm in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100.\nStephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, says its shares haven't recovered since warning shortly after the Brexit vote that the weaker pound would put off some UK holidaymakers and would make fuel - which it pays for in dollars - more expensive.\n\"The share price has taken a hammering and there's still a lot of uncertainty,\" Mr Furlong says.\nAnalysts at Barclays estimate that factors outside the airline's control, such as terror attacks, strikes in France and congestion at Gatwick, will cost Easyjet at least \u00a3150m this year.\nAlso towards the bottom of the FTSE performance table is British Airways owner IAG, which has seen its shares fall 23% on similar fears about a drop-off in UK travel abroad.\nLike airlines and UK banks, housebuilders are seen as the most at risk in the FTSE 100 if the UK economy slows down or enters recession.\nShares in construction companies are down significantly since the referendum, despite lower interest rates, an ongoing housing shortage and schemes like Help to Buy bolstering the property market.\nMr Khalaf says: \"The big elephant in the room is what effect Brexit will have on the economy and will it take its toll on house prices?\"\nTaylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon, three of the UK's biggest homebuilders, have made back some share price losses, but are still down 20%, 14% and 13% respectively.\nMore than 100 days on, the market seems settled in its forecasts on construction firms and which other companies will gain and lose in the post-Brexit landscape, says Mr Khalaf.\n\"It may or may not end up being the right call but for now it looks pretty rational,\" he adds.", "summary": "A hundred days ago the world woke up to the news that Britain had voted to leave the European Union.", "id": "37485412", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The market seems settled in its forecasts on construction firms and which other companies will gain and lose in the post-Brexit landscape, says Mr Khalaf. \"It may or may not end up being the right call but for now it looks pretty rational,\" he adds.\"\nThe FTSE 100 is the UK's biggest and most influential stock market index.

Champion our businesses, don't put a border at Berwick.\"\nShe added: \"At this election we can send the SNP a message they can't ignore, and with your help we can stop them, and in so doing we can get back to the issues that really matter.\"\nMs Sturgeon responded by accusing the Scottish Conservative leader of using independence as a smokescreen for her party's \"toxic\" policies.\nShe said: \"Ruth Davidson says I talk about nothing else, the truth is she talks so much about independence that I can't get a word in edgeways about it.\n\"Ruth Davidson is using independence as a smokescreen in this campaign because she knows the Tory record and Tory policies are toxic.\"\nMs Dugdale warned the opinion polls were suggesting that the Conservatives \"will be back and they will be more destructive than ever before\" after the election.\nShe added: \"So who do you want to stand up to the Tories? Labour MPs who understand your life, because they've lived, or SNP MPs who will use every bit of Tory cruelty to exploit the case for independence.\"\nMr Rennie said the SNP's focus was \"always independence\", adding: \"It took 44 days for Nicola Sturgeon to publish her Bill on another independence referendum. It took 15 months for them to write their mental health strategy.\n\"It took two years for us to persuade them to expand nursery education for two-year-olds and it took six years for us to persuade them about a pupil premium.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Harvie warned social and environmental rights, guaranteed in the EU, would be \"in the hands of a hard right Tory government hell-bent on a bonfire of the regulations\".\nAnd Mr Coburn used his opening remarks to state that \"UKIP is the party of Brexit. We must elect UKIP to the Commons to ensure Brexit means exit\".\nThe debate also saw Ms Sturgeon come under fire from the politically balanced audience over the SNP's record on health and education - both of which are devolved to the Scottish Parliament.\nOne member said she was a nurse and had been forced to use a foodbank.\nShe said that colleagues were considering leaving nursing, adding: \"You have no idea how demoralising it is to work in the NHS.\"\nMaking a direct plea to the first minister, she said: \"Don't come on your announced visits, come in in the middle of any day to any ward, to any A&E department and see what we're up against.\"\nMs Sturgeon told her \"My sister works in the National Health Service, believe me she tells me exactly what she thinks about these matters.\"\nShe said the \"austerity policies\" of the UK government meant public sector workers had had pay rises capped at 1%.\nAnd she stressed that the Scottish government had a policy of no compulsory redundancies in the NHS and wider public sector.\nAnalysis\nBy Philip Sim, BBC Scotland political reporter\nAt times it was like a Thursday session of First Minister's Questions, with the leaders of the main parties trading barbs over a faintly baffling mix of devolved and reserved policies.\nWith the SNP defending 56 seats, it was natural that the other leaders would target Nicola Sturgeon.\nSo, the early stages saw Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale attack the SNP's record in government, although the Scottish Tory leader came under sustained pressure herself over immigration.\nThere were the usual bouts of participants shouting over each other, and but it was notable that Ms Sturgeon came under much more detailed scrutiny than she did during the UK-wide debate on ITV on Thursday.\nThe first minister is a skilled operator when it comes to this political sparring though, so she held her ground reasonably well; it was a member of the audience who landed the most notable blow on her.\nThe nurse in the audience who took the first minister to task will go down as the most memorable moment of the debate, and will no doubt be the element which leads tomorrow's headlines.\nThere were also fierce exchanges between Ms Sturgeon and Ms Davidson over immigration, with the SNP leader arguing that Conservative manifesto pledges to slash net migration to the UK would be \"devastating\" for Scotland's economy.\nCalling for politicians to be \"honest\" about immigration, Ms Sturgeon continued: \"When we are talking about migrants here we are talking about people working in our hospitals, people serving us in our restaurants, we are talking about our friends and our neighbours.\n\"The language around immigration I think is shocking. We have got a need in this country to grow our population.\n\"If EU migration was to be ended over the next 25 years, or even constrained, we would see our working age population fall while our pensioner-age population is due to go up by 50%. That would be an economic catastrophe.\"\nMs Davidson said that \"no one is talking about ending\" migration from the EU, and that it was important that any immigration system was \"trusted\" by people in order to avoid it causing social unrest.\nShe added: \"What I want to see is Scotland to be the most attractive place so we can attract the brightest and the best. At the moment, despite having a third of the landmass of the UK, and 8.4% of the population, we only attract 4% of immigrants to this country\".\nMs Sturgeon said those figures - which Ms Davidson said were from the UK government - were \"not true\", and instead pointed to National Records of Scotland figures which said the country attracted 7% of migrants to the UK.", "summary": "Scotland's political leaders have traded blows over independence and immigration in a heated BBC debate.", "id": "39995184", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nMs Sturgeon said that \"no one is talking about ending\" migration from the EU, and that it was important that any immigration system was \"trusted\" by people in order to avoid it causing social unrest.

In the end, however, Moyes opted to retain faith with Zubikarai.\nOne interesting selection was Sergio Canales, the former Real Madrid and Valencia midfielder whose talent has never been in doubt but who has frequently failed to deliver. He was picked on the right of midfield.\nMoyes also overturned the much-debated decision of predecessor Jagoba Arrasate to sideline popular right-back Carlos Martinez, handing the 28-year-old only his third start of the season and leaving Arrasate's preferred choice Joseba Zaldua on the bench.\nMoyes's team lined up in a 4-4-2 formation - a playing system rarely used in Spain - with former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela given license to roam alongside Imanol Agirretxe in attack.\nHeeding their new manager's pre-match call for intensity and pace, La Real looked to get the ball forward as quick as possible, especially into wide areas with the intention of delivering crosses into the box.\nMoyes reportedly spent lots of time rehearsing set-pieces with his new players ahead of the game, and there also appeared to be an emphasis on launching swift counter-attacks.\nDuring the opening half, his team were well on top and came close to breaking the deadlock on a number of occasions, with Vela looking particularly menacing.\nBut they faded badly in the second period, struggling to sustain any attacking pressure and forced to drop ever deeper as hosts Deportivo pushed for a valuable winner.\nMidway through the second period, Moyes made a tactical switch by withdrawing winger Chory Castro and introducing central midfielder Ruben Pardo, with Vela dropping wide in a 4-5-1 formation in an attempt to establish more control over possession.\nThe plan did not work as Deportivo continued to look the more likely scorers, and Moyes was ultimately grateful to secure a point after goalkeeper Zubikarai justified his selection with a good late save from on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Jose Rodriguez.\nIf Moyes needed a reminder about the tendency of the Spanish temperament to indulge in flamboyant emotional outbursts - quite different from the stoic Scots - he was provided with one just half an hour into his first game in the country.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAfter Vela came close to scoring the opener with a speedy break, Deportivo assistant coach Roberto Cabellud exploded with fury on the touchline, approaching the visiting bench and directing his anger at Moyes, who reacted by standing on the edge of his technical area and producing the universal 'calm down' hand-pushing sign, with the effect that he appeared to be repeatedly patting an invisible large dog.\nThe Scot looked perplexed as referee Eduardo Prieto sent the unruly Cabellud straight down the tunnel and, although the cause of the spectacular fit of rage was not immediately clear, reports soon circulated that the Deportivo coach was enraged because Moyes had supposedly stepped onto the pitch during Vela's run towards goal.\nPerhaps it's just as well that Moyes's La Liga debut didn't come against Atletico Madrid and Mono Burgos\u2026\nReal Sociedad's performance - starting well but finishing poorly - was not a surprise to the club's fans, judging by their comments on social media.\nA lack of physical conditioning was one of the chief complaints directed against predecessor Arrasate, and although La Real supporters were clearly unhappy with the way their team faded, there was little in the way of dissent against the new manager.\nInstead, the tone was more realistic, with one fan quipping: \"Moyes is going to pack up his suitcase again now,\" and another summing up the mood of disenchantment with the former regime by opining: \"A year and a half of Jagoba [Arrasate] can't be fixed in a week.\"\nThe same views were shared by leading sports newspaper Marca, whose match report carried the headline: \"Moyes has a lot of work ahead of him,\" while El Pais billed the game as a \"tepid debut for Moyes\".\nAnd 'tepid' is perhaps the best word to describe an encounter which could have been a lot better but was by no means all bad for Real Sociedad.\nDespite having trained for little more than a week under their new manager, there was a clear gameplan and a commitment to fight for a point when the going got tough in the final stages - qualities which were not always been evident under Arrasate. And the biggest positive of all: it was their first clean sheet of the season.\nSo there is plenty to build on, but much more will be expected by the time of Moyes's next big date: the local derby with Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, 14 December.", "summary": "David Moyes kicked off his Spanish managerial career by guiding Real Sociedad to a 0-0 draw at struggling Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday night.", "id": "30165941", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nMoyes's first game in charge of Real Sociedad ended in a 0-0 draw at Deportivo La Coruna.\nThe Scot's team lined up in a 4-4-2 formation - a playing system rarely used in Spain - with former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela given license to roam alongside Imanol Agirretxe in attack.\nMoyes reportedly spent lots of time rehearsing set-pieces with his", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe new Real Sociedad manager has made a promising start to his tenure, with his team looking a lot more organised and committed than they did under his predecessor.\nThe new Real Sociedad manager has made a promising start to his tenure, with his team looking a lot more organised and committed than they did under his predecessor.\nThe new Real Sociedad manager has made a promising start to his tenure, with his team looking a lot", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe game was a 1-1 draw, with the visitors taking the lead through a goal from the impressive Vela, who was on the scoresheet again in the 65th minute.\nThe home side equalised in the 75th minute, with a goal from the impressive Imanol Agirretxe, who was on the scoresheet again in the 75th minute.\nThe game was a 1-1 draw, with the visitors", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "the new manager's first game in charge was a draw, but the team's performance was not a draw.\nThe team's performance was not a draw, but the team's performance was not a draw.\nThe team's performance was not a draw, but the team's performance was not a draw.\nThe team's performance was not a draw, but the team's performance was not a draw.\nThe team's performance was not a draw", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe game was a 1-1 draw.\nThe game was a 1-1 draw.

and that he wants to include \"ordinary\" Catholics in it.\nHis unprecedented exercise in consultation - the survey sent to all Catholic bishops with instructions to consult as widely as possible - is a powerful further sign of reform in the old top-down way of governing the Church.\nThe survey's 39 questions deal with sensitive subjects - contraception, gay marriage, sex outside marriage, and whether divorced and remarried people should be allowed Holy Communion.\nThe Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales was the first in the world to put the survey online, and is encouraging all Catholics to complete it by the deadline on 20 December.\nTheir responses are likely to confirm what bishops already know - that the behaviour of Catholics, including the roughly one third who go regularly to church, is diverging dramatically from the model of Catholic practice set out by the Church.\nExamples taken from the survey on the family by the Catholic Church in England and Wales\nBut rather than criticise, Pope Francis is convinced that the Church needs to understand - and his survey is part of that effort.\nA few weeks ago, the Pope criticised the Roman Catholic Church for being too focused on enforcing the rules for human behaviour based on its traditional beliefs.\nHe called it being locked up in \"small things and small-minded rules\", and an obsession with \"the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines\".\nThere is no sign that Pope Francis plans a major overhaul of Church doctrine, but it is clear that he wants a switch in emphasis to a message of mercy and forgiveness, especially towards those who are suffering.\nThe survey is itself a tacit acknowledgement that the way the Church deals with Catholics who cannot - or will not - follow official church teaching must change.\nThe way the survey has been worded has been criticised as obscure and convoluted, but there is no denying that it goes to the heart of fundamental and often awkward issues in the way Catholics lead their lives.\nIn one section - headed \"On Unions of Persons of the Same Sex\", one question asks: \"What pastoral attention can be given to people who have chosen to live in other types of union?\"\nAnother addresses the issue of contraception - but instead of using that word it refers to \"The openness of the married couple to life\".\nThe Church rules out artificial contraception, but questions whether couples are \"aware of how morally to evaluate the different methods of family planning\", before asking more directly \"Is this moral teaching accepted?\"\nThe truth is that much of the Church's moral teaching is not accepted.\nProfessor Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University, in research among 1,672 British Catholics for the Westminster Faith Debates,  finds them largely holding on to their identity as Catholics, but more likely to trust their own reason and judgement than the Church's rules in deciding their moral behaviour.\nOn an issue by issue basis, the results are remarkable, and give an insight into what the Pope is likely to learn from his survey.\nAccording to Professor Woodhead's findings, four in ten churchgoers - who are more respectful of the Church's teaching than non-attenders - would ban abortion altogether, and just under half of churchgoers think same-sex marriage is wrong.\nShe says: \"If we measure ['faithful Catholics'] by the criteria of weekly churchgoing, certain belief in God, taking authority from religious sources, and opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and euthanasia, only 5% of Catholics fit the mould, and only 2% of those under 30\".\nThose figures exclude elements such as the teaching on contraception, widely ignored by Catholic lay people.\nPope Francis is not offering to change teaching on contraception.\nThe Church would not believe it was serving anyone by dismantling its values - diluting what it regards as a \"gold standard\" for people who want to lead a good life.\nLike the Church's understanding of what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage - that is, between a man and a woman - contraception is an issue of doctrine, or core belief, and not open to reform.\nBut that is not to say there is not considerable room for manoeuvre, allowing the change of focus to the \"kinder\" and non-judgmental approach Pope Francis has repeatedly called for.\nThe Pope has shown that he is aware that even those Roman Catholics who shun the rules are hurt by the way the Church deals with them, in deeds as well as words.\nFor example, in the past the Church has described \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" as \"objectively disordered\".\nPope Francis has said that he does not feel in a position to judge homosexual people.\nThen there are the divorced people who have remarried - and are, according to the strict interpretation, therefore committing adultery and are denied Holy Communion.\nThe Vatican document accompanying the survey hints at a realisation that all might not be well by pointing out mournfully that \"many Catholic children and young people will never see their parents receive the sacraments\".\nEven Catholic bishops thought of as traditionalist - such as the Bishop of Portsmouth, Philip Egan - have called for a more merciful way of dealing with such people.\nEven without a reform of core beliefs, there could be significant changes in practice and what has already been identified as Pope Francis's \"style\" to reduce conflict in the Church's ideal values and the real lives of its members.\nAs some in the Church have already pointed out, to a great extent \"style is substance\" when it comes to applying the rules.\nIn matters such as contraception for example, new thinking could call for Catholic couples to be \"open to life\" in their sexual relationship, but leave up to their consciences how exactly they manage it.\nResponses to the survey are to be given to Catholic bishops before they gather in Rome next September for a special meeting, or synod, to discuss the Church's approach to \"the family\".\nThey are due to meet in 2015 to issue new guidance to Catholics based on their discussion next September.\nMost were selected by the traditionalist popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, but the Catholic commentator John Wilkins says even traditionalists are aware of the gulf between teaching and practice.\n\"It's a dangerous gap for an institution like the Church,\" says Mr Wilkins. \"It can deal with it in two ways - either by clamping down from the top, which runs the risk of reducing the Church to a small sect, or by adapting its teaching, focusing on Jesus, so that Catholics can say, 'yes, that's me, that's what I believe'.\"\nTo some extent the very fact of the Pope's survey, broaching issues Catholics were once not encouraged to discuss, has raised expectations, assumptions which, whether justified or not, might be hard to satisfy.", "summary": "A survey of ordinary believers' views on sexual ethics signals a potentially ground-breaking change of emphasis for the Roman Catholic Church.", "id": "24955321", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

Another 32 died in later operations.\nGeorge 'Johnny' Johnson, one of three surviving Dambusters, thanked the BBC for its work on the online gallery but said any account of the raid would not be complete without the names of Roy Chadwick, who designed the Lancaster bomber used in the attack, and Sir Barnes Wallis, the engineer behind the bouncing bomb.\nBy Greig WatsonBBC News\nThe original idea was to show the human face of a story which is now close to mythology.\nIt is easy to talk about the cost of the raids and the youth of the crews but to see the faces, to almost look into their eyes, really brings home their sacrifice and bravery.\nMy thanks goes out to all the families and organisations across the globe who have allowed us to publish this lasting tribute to those who took part in one of the most famous and fascinating events of World War II.\nDambusters: See all the men who took part\nMr Johnson added: \"It is a great privilege for me to add these words of appreciation and thanks, for in bringing together again all 133 men of the Dambusters, 70 years on from the raid, this photo montage and site is a fitting dedication to all who took part in Operation Chastise on 16/17 May 1943, particularly those who gave their lives and failed to return.\"\nDavid Robertson, chairman of the 617 Squadron Association, said: \" We believe this is the first time that there has been such a record of the crews who flew on Operation Chastise.\n\"It is a most fitting commemoration of the men whose skill, courage, determination and airmanship has gone down in the annals of air warfare as one of the most remarkable operations of World War II.\"\nJohn Sweetman, author of The Dambusters Raid and The Official Dambusters Experience, said wartime secrecy and the \"simplified\" story told in the film had led to many myths springing up about the operation.\n\"But research has made some of the story clearer,\" he explained. \"The inexperience of some crews, the group effort to make the bombs work, the impact on the German war industry.\n\"Even now, there is lots we don't know, particularly in the frantic last days and hours leading up to the raids, when crucial decisions were made.\n\"The story, hopefully, will continue to be discovered.\"\nAmong the surprises, and challenges, encountered by the project were the large gaps in the official photographic archives.\nCurator of photographs at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) Ian Carter explained that 125,000 men flew with the RAF and many lasted just a matter of weeks.\n\"All this meant that very few individuals were actually recorded by the official RAF photographers,\" he said.\n\"Of course, some men took unofficial snaps on their own cameras, and we have examples within IWM's collection, but many more remain in private hands.\n\"Researching their whereabouts is a far more difficult and lengthy process, as the BBC researchers have found out.\"\nPeter Elliott, head of archives at the Royal Air Force Museum, added that even when photographs were taken, many were lost.\n\"At the end of the war bases were closing and men were leaving or dead and a lot must have seemed pointless to store.\nBy Charles FosterDambusters researcher\nWhen I was asked to help with the gallery I thought it was a great idea.\nIt was a chance to collect the pictures we knew were out there and perhaps find those which were missing.\nI knew we could get about 90% of the pictures but the rest were likely to be tricky. So when the last of the photos were located I was just so pleased, it was so exciting.\nHaving read the names of these men so often, suddenly they had faces.\nDambusters blog\n\"It's always good to be able to put a face to a name, especially if it's something notable like the Dambusters and people ought to be able to commemorate those involved properly.\n\"But it happens the other way too - many museums have countless pictures with no names to go with them. I've see many, many images of young men, standing next to their aircraft and we have no idea who they were, which is rather sad.\"\nDouglas Radcliffe, secretary of the Bomber Command Association, recalled Dambuster pilot David Shannon was keen to put the raid in context.\n\"He would talk about the dams but would then slide the conversation towards all the other raids he took part in, some immensely costly.\n\"And it is important to remember all those other crews, who took part in less famous raids, who also served and also deserve our respect.\"\nMike Gibson, the nephew of Guy Gibson, who won the Victoria Cross for leading the dams raid, felt the public attitude towards bomber crews had seesawed from admiration to cynicism and back again.\nHe added: \"People have come to appreciate what these men went through, living on bases knowing they would have to fly into terrible danger again and again and again, that the odds were against them. Who could sustain that today?\n\"To some extent I think the Dambusters have come to represent all of the men who flew.

I thought, when they get to us they're going to give us a bashing, too,\" Brother Freddy says.\n\"I was standing on the top of the stairs, with my hands in the air and my eyes closed as two of them came up the stairs.\"\nThe two told Brother Freddy to hand over his phone, which he did, and then one of them gave a signal and they all left.\n\"They took everything, all the food, and what they couldn't take they destroyed, such as the microwave. \"They even overturned the pots with the plants!\"\nBrother Freddy is convinced that the group was organised and suspects that its members were part of a \"colectivo\", the name given to pro-government militant groups.\nClashes between anti-government marchers and colectivos are not unusual at marches.\nMr Ram\u00edrez thinks the intruders may have been searching for the protesters who had earlier taken shelter in the school, and that when they did not find them they went on the rampage.\nHe reported the incident to the authorities and police are investigating.\nThe mayor's office sent three guards to protect the school in the aftermath of the attack and while the main gate was being fixed.\nThe school re-opened on 24 April.\nBut Mr Ramirez says that at least 40% of the school's 704 students are not attending class out of fear a similar incident could happen again.\nManuel and Mathias are among those being kept at home.\nManuel says he was very sad when he heard about what had happened. \"How can it be that someone would attack a school just because it sheltered some people?\" he asks.\nA keen footballer like his father, he has been using his free time to train.\nHis younger brother Mathias is also fed up with the situation in Venezuela.\n\"It's been two years since I've had any Nutella,\" he says of the shortages of imported goods.\nTheir mother, Sara Y\u00e9pez, says she just does not want to run the risk of them getting hurt in school or on the way there.\nBut it is not just that, she says. Like her husband, Andrew P\u00e1ez, she believes that the situation in Venezuela has deteriorated so much, drastic measures are called for.\n\"Normal life has ceased, and if we want our children to have the opportunities they once had, we need to stop carrying on as normal,\" she says.\n\"And if that means that our children may have to repeat a year, so be it.\"\n\"At any moment you can get hurt, you can get robbed and your salary does not cover the basics, even if you can find them,\" she says of Venezuela's rampant crime rate and its hyperinflation.\nLina Contreras, an independent business woman who has a 17-year-old son at La Salle school, agrees.\n\"We want to send a message to the country that we can't send our kids to school when other young people are giving their lives on the streets,\" she says referring to the protest in which dozens of people have been killed over the past weeks.\nAndrew P\u00e1ez says that what his sons are missing out on in terms of schooling is made up for by what they are learning as individuals.\n\"Ethics and values are more important at this point,\" he says.\nThey also try to ensure that the children keep up with the curriculum.\nAfter teaching mechanical engineering at the University of the Andes, Sara Y\u00e9pez rushes home to sit down and study with Manuel and Mathias.\nThey say they are lucky to have someone to help them look after them when they are both at work.\nAs owners of their own company, Lina Contreras and her husband have also been able to adapt their schedule enough to make sure someone is there for their son at key times.\nAll three say it is a sacrifice they are willing to make.\nNot all parents agree with the stand Lina Contreras, Andrew P\u00e1ez and Sara Y\u00e9pez are taking.\nMore than half are sending their children to La Salle whenever the roads around the school are not blocked by protests, not wanting them to miss out on their schooling.\nOthers just do not have anyone who can look after them while they are at work.\nBut they, too, are worried by the security situation and many have had to leave work to collect their children from school early when a march passed nearby.\nWith no end to the protests in sight, Andrew P\u00e1ez and Sara Y\u00e9pez say they may have to consider leaving Venezuela altogether, as 17 of their nieces and nephews have already done.\nLina Contreras says she is optimistic that the protests will bring about a change of government and that her son may be able to graduate this year as planned.", "summary": "Venezuela is gripped by an ever-deepening economic and political crisis that has triggered almost daily anti-government protests since April.", "id": "40012642", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.\tThe article is about the impact of the protests on the lives of Venezuelan children. 2.\tThe protests have led to a high crime rate, hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods. 3.\tThe protests have led to the closure of schools and the cancellation of school trips. 4.\tThe protests have led to the closure of schools and the cancellation of school trips. 5.\tThe protest", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe school was closed on 19 April, but the director was in his office doing some grading.\nWhen some noise was heard, he went to investigate and found a group of about 40 people had broken into the school.\nThe school was broken into again on 20 April, but this time the director was not there.\nThe school was broken into again on 21 April, but this time the director was not there.\nThe school was broken into", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe protests have been going on for more than a month, and the government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe government has not yet been able to restore order.\nThe", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\n\"We are not going to leave the country, but we are going to leave the country,\" says Lina Contreras.\n\"We are not going to leave the country, but we are going to leave the country,\" says Sara Y\u00e9pez.\n\"We are not going to leave the country, but we are going to leave the country,\" says Lina Contreras.\n\"We are not going to leave the country, but we are going to leave the country", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe protests in Venezuela have been going on for more than a month.\nThe protests are against the government of President Nicolas Maduro.\nThe protests have been violent.\nThe protests have been led by the opposition.\nThe protests have been against the government's plans to rewrite the constitution.\nThe protests have been against the government's plans to rewrite the constitution.

The election has delayed that process and there may be other factors too,\" he said.\n\"But now with Greg Clark back in place as business secretary I'm hopeful of a definitive answer soon.\"\nMr Hendry added that he had been \"very enthused\" by the degree of cross-party support for the world-first power generation project.\nThe proposal for a 320MW lagoon off Swansea Bay, involving a 9.5km seawall embedded with 16 turbines, is being developed by Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP).\nThe project was included in the Conservatives' 2015 manifesto and was granted planning permissions by then Energy Secretary Amber Rudd that same year.\nHowever government support seemed to wane as discussions continued over the so-called strike price, a guarantee to subsidise the cost of electricity from the scheme.\nThe latest proposal by TLP involved a price of \u00a389.90 per megawatt hour, guaranteed for 90 years.\nBy comparison, the price agreed for the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years.\nAn independent review was commissioned in February 2016 to look into the viability of tidal lagoon schemes and it reported almost a year later.\nTidal lagoon: The economic arguments\nThe environmental arguments\nHow tidal energy could transform the coastline\nMr Hendry concluded that moving ahead with the prototype lagoon in Swansea Bay was in the national interest.\nThe developers had argued that it would kick-start a new industry and that a \"fleet\" of larger, more cost-effective lagoons across the UK coastline could follow.\nTLP is based in Gloucester and the city's Conservative MP Richard Graham is the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Marine Energy and Tidal Lagoons.\nHe told BBC Wales he had met with Greg Clark this week and had \"a good discussion\".\n\"I think he absolutely gets it that we cannot prevaricate as a government indefinitely on this - and a decision should be made as soon as possible,\" he said.\nMr Graham said he had consistently made the point to Mr Clark that the tidal lagoon was \"probably the most popular energy project of our lifetimes.\"\nHe added: \"If we want a government that's got an industrial strategy, that's going to do innovative things, this is the project, this is the time - let's go for it.\"\nWhat could the delay mean?\nRichard Howard, head of energy for the Policy Exchange think-tank told BBC Wales the delay in responding to the review showed that TLP was yet to \"put together a proposition to government that is sufficiently compelling\".\n\"In the time in which this project has been developed we've seen massive, radical reductions in the cost of solar energy, offshore and onshore wind and that will continue,\" he said.\n\"So actually locking yourself into a tidal lagoon for 90 years might not actually be the right option.\"\nAs the wait for a go-ahead goes on, money is drying up for TLP with the scheme's backers now refusing to release further funds, the Financial Times reported.\nDavid Clubb, director of Renewable UK Cymru said he was concerned that private investment that was \"strongly needed\" in south Wales would go elsewhere.\n\"Clearly every new project of this scale suggests risks - and it is right that the government should consider those risks.\"\n\"But the Hendry Review was a very in-depth, comprehensive study which took account of all of those risks and it still came to the conclusion that this was a no regrets option.\"\n\"So we would say to the government, let's act now - these sorts of opportunities don't come along very often.\"\nA decision is needed this summer, TLP says, for work to start on the lagoon in 2019.\nNew evidence on the impact on fish\nAnother hurdle remains in Wales, which is the issuing of a marine licence by the environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).\nThe process started in 2014, with TLP and NRW saying they have been in \"exhaustive discussions\" about the impact on fish.\nIn December 2016, NRW published figures suggesting the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, as they migrate to and from local rivers.\nThe developers strongly refuted that analysis which they claimed had \"no scientific basis\", branding the figures \"grossly misleading\".\nNow they have submitted what they claim is a \"finalised projection\" of the development's likely impact on the marine environment, having agreed a new modelling method with NRW.\nAndy Schofield, TLP's head of fisheries said the work had been \"particularly challenging\" as this was a world-first scheme and there was little research already available about fish behaviour in the Bristol channel.\nHe said the developers had looked for other examples across the world and spoken to leading experts in the field.\n\"The results we are now presenting show that the lagoon will have a very low impact on fish.\"\n\"The other reassurance is that when the lagoon is constructed we will have an adaptive environmental management plan in place and we will be constantly monitoring for any impact.\"\n\"We believe that these figures will now enable NRW to grant us a marine license and we hope that they will be able to do that in early 2018.\"\nNRW will now launch a fresh consultation on the marine licence application in light of the new evidence submitted by TLP.\nCeri Davies, executive director of evidence policy and permitting for NRW, said: \"We support the development of sustainable renewable energy.

The list dropped to 39 shortly after when one was removed for copyright reasons.\nIt was a fairly predictable selection of Maori symbols, silver ferns and Southern Crosses. Just one made a reference to the Union Jack.\nA few weeks later, the Flag Consideration Panel unveiled it four finalists.\nThree silver ferns and one koru Maori symbol. All male designers, two of them the same man.\nNew Zealanders were by and large uninspired.\nThe creative mind behind Laser Kiwi, incidentally, found them \"a tad disappointing\".\n\"I think these people actually take their artwork seriously.\"\nBut a rebellion was brewing. Across the land, New Zealanders were throwing their support behind an outsider - Red Peak by Wellington-based Aaron Dustin.\nThrough the power of social media, some slick lobbying from Mr Dustin himself and perhaps a degree of trouble-making spirit, a petition for Red Peak to be added as a fifth finalist gobbled up signatures.\nSignatories called it drawable, appropriately symbolic, and with the colours and shapes to represent the nation.\nAt first, Mr Key stood firm and defended the \"well set-out process\" of the judging panel. But 52,000 signatures were too many to ignore.\nAfter a heated late-night debate, in which one MP compared Red Peak to a Nazi sentry box, parliament performed a dramatic U-turn and pushed through legislation to change the Flag Referendums Act to allow Red Peak to join the final stretch of the race.\nStage one of the referendum, which ran from mid-November to mid-December 2015 asked New Zealanders which of the five designs they'd want IF the flag were to change.\nAbout 1.5 million people sent in a postal ballot, just under half of registered voters and a better turnout than some had predicted. And with just over 50% of the vote, this was the winner.\nDesigner Kyle Lockwood, who'd had two designs in the final and had the prime minister's backing, said he was \"speechless\", but that as Silver Fern had both red on it and the Southern Cross \"we've got the best of both worlds really\".\nThe flag was put in place across the country so people could get a feel for it.\nOne feng shui master, however, told the New Zealand Herald the colours represented mourning and its bad energy could cause a stock market crash.\nAnother month-long postal ballot opened in March - after unexpected encouragement came from sitcom The Big Bang Theory telling the \"crazy Kiwis\" that \"we're rooting for you\".\nThis time, the ballot papers asked whether Silver Fern should officially become the new symbol of New Zealand.\nMore than two million ballots were sent in and from fairly early on it appeared the status quo was leading the way.\nOne telephone survey in late March, however, found 59% of people condemned the whole NZ$23m ($17.4m; \u00c2\u00a312.3m) process as \"a distraction and a waste of money\".\nThe result on 24 March was close: 1,200,003 for no change, 915,008 for change.\nMr Key took it on the chin, calling on New Zealanders to \"embrace\" their flag.\nSo is that it? Officially yes, the Union Jack-bedecked flag will continue to fly above Aotearoa.\nBut there will be plenty who say the current flag was just the least bad of the two options.\nLewis Holden, chairman of Change the NZ Flag campaign group, told the BBC earlier this week there was still \"a large sentiment for change\".\n\"But the questions remain on what to change to. We'll keep campaigning, we have thousands of followers on FB, and strong support base and strong sentiment, but simply the issues have got in the way of the process.\"\nAnd of course it remains to be seen whether rebellious New Zealanders may yet be pinning a Laser Kiwi to their lapels.\nAdditional reporting by Tessa Wong", "summary": "The results are in, New Zealanders have spoken - and they do not want a new flag.", "id": "35878485", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe flag of New Zealand is a defaced Blue Ensign: a blue field with the Union Flag in the canton (upper hoist quarter), and four red stars with white borders in a rectangular pattern known as the Southern Cross, representing the four main islands of New Zealand.

He married a British woman in Dublin in 2012 and lived in the city's Rathmines area.\nA man was arrested in Limerick, in the Irish Republic on Tuesday over the discovery of ID documents in Redouane's name. He was later released without charge.\nA second man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Tuesday evening, with the Garda saying it was also related to Redouane. He is being held in Wexford.\nEntering the final day of election campaigning, Theresa May said she will change human rights laws if they \"get in the way\" of tackling suspected terrorists.\nThe PM said she would make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects and \"restrict the freedom and movements\" of those that present a threat.\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, said existing human rights laws did not stand in the way of taking action against suspected terrorists.\n\"If we start throwing away our adherence to human rights... we are throwing away the very values at the heart of our democracy,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nFormer SAS commander Col Tim Collins has said intelligence \"isn't good enough\", adding that police needed to recruit informants from within the Muslim community and appoint Muslim officers.\n\"MI5 and the police have to recruit sources, informants,\" he told Today. \"Intelligence from within the community is improving, but there's a lot more to be gleaned.\"\nFour of those killed in the attack have been named.\nAustralian Kirsty Boden, 28, worked as a senior staff nurse at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London. Her family have described her in a statement as an \"outgoing, kind and generous person\".\n\"We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life,\" they added.\nThe hospital said that Ms Boden was \"an outstanding nurse and a hugely valued member of the staff team in Theatres Recovery, described by her colleagues as 'one in a million' who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care\".\nCanadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Her family said she had died in her fianc\u00c3\u00a9's arms after being struck by the attackers' speeding van.\nThe family of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, say they believe he also died.\nMr McMullan's sister said he was believed to be among those who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene.\nTwo French nationals were also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.\nThe BBC understands one of them to be Alexandre Pigeard, 27.\nManager of the Boro Bistro, Vincent Le Berre, told the Brittany news outlet Le Telegramme how his colleague was attacked in a bar near Borough Market.\n\"I managed to escape him, but my friend Alexandre did not have that chance,\" he said. \"He was hit in the neck with a knife.\"\nMr Le Drian confirmed on Wednesday that a second French citizen had been \"identified among those who have died\".\nThe identity of the victim has not been released.\nThe Met have set up a casualty bureau on 0800 096 1233 and 020 7158 0197 for people concerned about friends or relatives.", "summary": "One of the London Bridge attackers was able to enter the UK, despite being placed on an EU-wide watch list.", "id": "40183147", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The Met have set up a casualty bureau on 0800 096 1233 and 020 7158 0197 for people concerned about friends or relatives.

A recent survey found contractors' confidence was at a \"record low\".\nNorth Sea exploration reached its lowest level in at least two decades in 2014, with 14 explorations wells drilled compared with 44 in 2008.\nMs Michie said: \"We have paid more to the Treasury than most other industrial sectors, we generate hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, we have a vibrant supply chain, at home and abroad, and make a key contribution to the UK's security of energy supply. It is an industry that has grown and evolved for 50 years.\n\"However, we now face real and present threats that are challenging our future. At $60 oil, 10% of our production is struggling to make money and there is a shortage of capital and a shortage of investors willing to place their money here.\n\"Therefore it is not unreasonable for the North Sea to set out its stall at being sustainable in a $60 world. As a target, it's one that we as a trade association can champion, government can align with and the regulator can pursue as an enabler, for example, to focus on key infrastructure.\"\nShe added that focusing on efficiencies would be a key factor for the industry's future.\nMs Michie also believed it was vital for clients, employers, employees, unions, trade associations and governments to work together.\nShe said: \"This is not a time for conflict or entrenched positions.\n\"We don't need to wait for consensus, but we do need leadership in this industry to drive co-operation and an 'early adopter' culture from companies willing to rise to the challenge.\"\nWhen Oil and Gas UK, the trade body, convened this conference last year, the oil price was about to start its slide from $115 per barrel. By January, it hit $45. It's now in the mid-60s, with conflicting signs of its future direction of travel.\nFew think it will rise much above $70, because that's the point at which fracking starts again in North America, pushing up supply. Fracking is much more responsive to price than offshore producers can afford to be.\nThat plunge in the value of this asset has focused attention on the problem of the high cost of operating in British waters. Along with some North American reserves of oil and gas, this is seen in a global context as among the most expensive places to operate.\nCosts per barrel have been rising very steeply; partly because fewer barrels are flowing from older, smaller and hard-to-reach reserves: as old equipment needs more and longer shutdowns for maintenance: and partly because the industry had become inefficient through recent years of booming investment.\nMuch of the talk in Aberdeen this week will be about driving those costs down further, including the tax bill. Frustration about tax, along with regulation, was found to have soared in a recent survey of industry concerns in north-east Scotland.\nHowever, the industry's requests for reduced tax were largely answered in George Osborne's March Budget. The unfinished business is on incentives for exploration, which has been particularly weak of late, and eventually removing Petroleum Revenue Tax altogether.\nRead more from Douglas\nThe Scottish government previously said changes to the industry brought by the chancellor in his recent Budget had not gone far enough to support the oil and gas industry, with particular mention of exploration credit.\nMs Sturgeon reiterated these calls when she opened the conference.\nShe said: \"At this time in the previous parliament nobody in the industry had any inkling that the UK government might decide to increase the supplementary charge from 20% to 32%. Indeed, even on the morning of the announcement, nobody expected it.\n\"The Scottish government argued strongly for reversing that increase - and also for replacing the current system of field allowances with one unified investment allowance. We are pleased that the UK government has introduced both measures.\n\"But it now needs to go further.\n\"The UK government should make a commitment that there will be no tax increases for the industry for the whole of this UK Parliament.\n\"Even more importantly, it should promise that all significant policy proposals will be subject to consultation with the industry and the Oil and Gas Authority.\n\"The UK government should demonstrate that it has learnt from the mistakes of five years ago. Working in partnership is far more effective than operating in isolation.\"\nScottish Labour's Shadow Finance Secretary Jackie Baillie said government at all levels \"must work together to support workers who have lost their jobs and attract further investment to secure existing jobs\".\nShe added: \"One thing Nicola Sturgeon yet again failed to do today was publish an updated oil and gas bulletin, so that workers and investors can properly understand the future of the industry.\n\"Last week the independent Office for Budget Responsibility cut its forecasts for future oil and gas tax receipts by \u00c2\u00a335bn.\n\"The fact that this blew a hole through the SNP's disastrous plan for full fiscal autonomy shouldn't be an excuse not to publish an updated oil and gas bulletin.\n\"The SNP should put party politics aside and give an honest assessment about the future of one of Scotland's most important industries.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Treasury said the UK government wanted to ensure the oil and gas industry was in the best possible position to manage the current decline in investment.\nShe added: \"We can't control the oil price - but we've delivered on the Wood Review recommendations and established the Oil and Gas Authority.\n\"In addition, the package of support announced in the Budget in March is expected to encourage over $4bn of additional investment in the UK's oil and gas industry over the next five years.\n\"We look forward to the industry capitalising on this, to deliver efficiencies and make the industry more robust now and for the future.\"\nGordon Colborn, from PwC in Scotland, believed the industry could have a sustainable future.\nHe added: \"We need to take a more strategic and integrated view if we are to extend the life of the North Sea for everyone involved and for future generations.

which calls for a permanent EU crisis reserve to be set up within the budget - will be put to a vote on Wednesday.\nAlso to be debated during the afternoon is an advisory report from Parliament's special tax investigation committee which sets out a number of recommendations for reforming corporate taxation.\nThe committee was set up in February to continue the work of a previous inquiry committee established after the Luxleaks revelations about favourable corporate tax deals in Luxembourg.\nThe afternoon's big debate will be on legislation to set up the EU's proposed Border and Coast Guard force, proposed last year as part of a drive to improve management of the external borders of the Schengen area.\nMEPs struck a provisional deal on the new force with national ministers at the end of last month, which will also be put to a vote on Wednesday.\nThe evening will also see a debate on the EU's first-ever directive on cybersecurity - a deal on that will also be put to a vote at the same time.\nUnder the new legislation, companies designated as providing critical services will have to report serious security breaches to national authorities.\nIt would fall to national authorities to determine which firms fall into this category, and to draw up \"national strategies\" for dealing with cybersecurity threats.\nSlovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be in town to start the day with a debate on his country's plans for its EU presidency, which gets underway this month.\nMr Fico last week admitted that Brexit negotiations were now likely to exert \"considerable influence\" over his country's planned agenda for the next six months.\nAfter this, MEPs will debate what they would like to see in the Commission's legislative programme for next year.\nDuring the lunchtime voting session, they will pass a non-binding motion setting out their wish-list, before the Commission unveils its new agenda in the autumn.\nAfter lunch, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini is due to join them to debate her plans to update the EU's common defence and security policies.\nThe long-awaited document called for \"strategic convergence\" between the defence policies of EU states, as well as co-operation on defence research.\nMEPs will also debate relations with China, the bloc's annual report on respect for human rights and EU priorities at this September's UN General Assembly.\nIn the evening they will also discuss protection for whistle-blowers following the conviction of two men last week for their involvement in the Luxleaks scandal.\nThe two former PwC employees received 12 and nine-month sentences respectively for leaking documents exposing favourable tax arrangements offered by Luxembourg to some of the world's biggest companies.\nMEPs have previously called for changes to EU rights law to protect whistle-blowers who leak information deemed to be in the public interest.\nThe session begins with debate on a motion calling on all EU institutions to \"implement fully\" the recommendations of an UN disability rights committee.\nAmong the committee's recommendations was a call for the EU to ratify the optional protocol to the UN's Disabilities Convention.\nAfter this, they will then debate and vote on this month's human rights motions, which focus on Malawi, Bahrain and Myanmar.\nAlso up for a vote is a motion to veto Commission rules which would allow drinks companies to advertise that their caffeinated drinks increase alertness.\nThe text says energy drinks have been linked to behavioural problems in children - and calls on the Commission to introduce stricter marketing rules.\nIn the afternoon, they will debate regulatory discrimination against food suppliers in the single market and legal protection for EU data transfers to China.\nThe session will end with a debate on how the EU Commission enforces the application of national minimum wage legislation.\nIt comes after the Commission decided last week to launch legal action against France and Germany for requiring foreign transport drivers to be paid the French or German minimum wage.\nPlease note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.\nA guide to how the European Parliament's plenary sessions can be found here.", "summary": "MEPs return to Strasbourg this week still pondering the potential fallout from last month's dramatic Brexit vote in the UK.", "id": "36690287", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe European Parliament is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union (EU).

Convicted in 2012, Stanford denies any wrongdoing and has vowed to clear his name.\nWhen asked how he felt about the humiliation the ECB had suffered as a result of its association with him, Stanford said: \"It makes me very, very sad. I'm very sorry\".\nSpeaking from the maximum-security Coleman II federal prison in Sumterville, Florida, he admitted: \"It breaks my heart and there's nothing I can say other than that was not caused by Allen Stanford.\"\n\"That was caused by the wrongful prosecution... an over zealous and a wrongful prosecution.\"\nStanford signed a deal with with the ECB for a series of five Twenty20 games between England and a Caribbean side nicknamed the 'Stanford All-Stars'. The winners of each of the five games would collect a prize-fund of $20m (\u00a313.75m), the largest ever for a team sporting event. The losers would get nothing.\nThe exuberant tycoon promoted the series by flying into Lord's, where he was greeted by the ECB's then chairman Giles Clarke and chief executive David Collier.\nThe long-term deal collapsed the following year when the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Stanford, and the ECB cut all ties. But many felt the the governing body had been blinded by Stanford's wealth and should have seen the warning signs. Both Clarke's and Collier's reputations were damaged by the ill-fated partnership.\n\"I'm not sure if Giles Clarke is still the head person now, but he and I got along well,\" said Stanford.\n\"And I think the world of David Collier.\n\"My dealings with the ECB was one of professionalism and one of mutual respect and I love cricket.\"\nUltimately, only one match took place between England and the All Stars, England suffering a humiliating 10-wicket defeat in Antigua in November 2008. Stanford also ended up having to apologise to the losers for cavorting with some of their wives and girlfriends during their warm-up victory over Middlesex, at one point bouncing the pregnant wife of wicketkeeper Matt Prior on his knee.\n\"To tell you the truth I don't remember doing that,\" he said.\n\"It's one of those blurry blank spots. What I remember is going down there, I didn't know who they were. I just saw a group of young gals sitting there and they were waving at me and the camera was following me around and they said 'come over here and take your picture with us' so I did.\n\"There was one chair shy of having us all sitting there, so I said 'here come sit on my knee', and we were going to take a picture and that was the end of it.\n\"I had no idea those were the English players' wives and that created quite a bit of an uproar. But I apologised for it. I went over to the English locker room and I apologised to the guys. I said 'look I was just over there having fun with the crowd like I always do, I was just horsing around, I didn't mean anything by it', and they accepted my apology.\"\nStanford's involvement in cricket began in 2006, when the Antigua-based banker created and funded the first Stanford 20/20 tournament. By the time a second tournament took place in 2008, watched by a reported global audience of 300 million, he was considered the world's leading promoter of the sport, and a cricket innovator.\nWhen asked what he thought of those who said he had exploited cricket, Stanford said: \"I would say they are absolutely correct.\n\"I was trying to grow the Stanford brand globally. I mean anybody would be foolish not to spend the money, and I spent about $30-odd million on cricket in the West Indies in addition to what I spent on the 20/20 for 20 tournament.\n\"But I certainly did want a return on that investment in terms of a business sense.\n\"But what nobody understood is that I anticipated this new generation of players that we were going to uncover.\n\"When we had our first cricket tournament we broadcast that and I gave the TV rights away globally. We had over a billion people watch our matches and that was the island versus island competition.\n\"My goal was to have a vehicle where I could uncover new talent, take the money that this tournament generated, and pile it back into the island so that they could develop their own programmes, home-grow these young athletes and bring them to the Stanford 20/20. We would pick the best players out of the tournament. These would not be the superstars that currently play for the West Indies, these would be unknown young guys.\n\"In the West Indies we have the greatest physical athletic talent for cricket anywhere in the world. They were just being diverted into other sports, whether it's basketball or soccer. There just wasn't that real incentive for them to stay and play in a sport that had not kept track with the 21st Century and the modernisation of the sport.\"\nStanford says he never watches cricket now that he is behind bars.\n\"Cricket is not a very big sport in prison. In fact, I've had to educate some of the guys what cricket is all about. Occasionally I run into a guy from the West Indies - it filters through the system here, and of course they know who I am and we immediately have a talk.\n\"But cricket is not shown on any of the few televisions that are available here.\n\"I try to keep up with it best I can, but my focus right now is to get out of prison and to see these wrongs made right and to see that I get back with my family.\"\nListen to a BBC Radio 5 live special on the Allen Stanford interview from 21:00 on Monday, 11 January.", "summary": "Jailed fraudster Allen Stanford says the embarrassment he caused English cricket chiefs \"breaks his heart\".", "id": "35284752", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nStanford was interviewed by BBC Sport's Mike Bushell.\nStanford was interviewed by BBC Sport's Mike Bushell.

He founded the party in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists; the party of the political establishment since the state was founded in 1921.\nUnlike nationalists, who want to see the Irish border removed and rule from Westminster ended, unionists want the link with Britain preserved. For most of his political career, Ian Paisley saw the prospect of devolved power sharing with his political enemies as a Trojan Horse to Irish unity.\nHe set his face against successive attempts to cobble together an agreement between nationalists and unionists, knowing that simply by saying no he could make political gains. And so it was that by 2005 the Democratic Unionist Party, which started as the party of resistance to any hint of accommodation, displaced the ruling class of the Ulster Unionists as the party which could legitimately claim to speak for all of unionism.\nPower sharing with Sinn Fein followed in 2007 and, until recently, the DUP had a reputation for fiscal prudence and deft political strategising.\nWhen Ian Paisley became first minister in Stormont - Northern Ireland's seat of government - with Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's Martin McGuinness acting as deputy first minister, the two of them got on so well that they were nicknamed the \"chuckle brothers\". But all of that seems like a distant memory.\nThe party remained electorally dominant under its next leader Peter Robinson, but relations between nationalists and unionists in the country's fragile power-sharing executive began to cool.\nAfter Mr Robinson lost his Westminster seat in the 2010 general election, Mrs Foster took over as party leader in December 2015, and first minister in 2016.\nHer leadership has been sullied by controversy over the Renewable Heat Incentive Deal, which saw the power-sharing executive collapse in 2017, causing a snap election in Stormont.\nNorthern Ireland is still without a government but the DUP has found itself in a position to influence political events across the entire United Kingdom, and that has led to scrutiny of some of the party's policies.\nThe party may be less overtly religious than it was in the days when Rev Paisley was in charge, but on social issues it is still deeply conservative. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases.\nDUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, a devout climate change denier, was once Northern Ireland's environment minister.\nMervyn Storey, the party's former education spokesman, once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes.\nHe has also objected to an exhibition on evolution in the Ulster Museum and signs at the Giant's Causeway in his North Antrim constituency.\nThen there's the party's historical links to loyalist paramilitaries.\nDuring this general election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly received the endorsement of the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations.\nAlthough the DUP said it did not accept their support, in her acceptance speech, Mrs Little-Pengelly thanked those who came out to vote for her, singling out several loyalist working class areas in Belfast.\nIn December, the DUP's Trevor Clarke was criticised by Sir Elton John after the politician admitted he did not know heterosexual people could contract HIV until a charity explained the facts to him.\nThe DUP was a wholehearted supporter of Brexit and got heavily involved in the Leave campaign.\nAfter Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland becomes an EU frontier and the DUP is not in favour of a so-called hard border. This means no checkpoints or intrusive enforcement.\nSo no hard border but in the round, the party's vision of Brexit is a fairly hard one - it was the most Eurosceptic party in the UK before the ascent of UKIP.\nThe party also wants to leave the EU customs union - their manifesto says there should be \"progress on new free trade deals with the rest of the world\" - and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, ensuring that in future British law is supreme.\nOne red line is the idea of Northern Ireland being granted some sort of \"special status\" when Brexit comes to pass - the DUP will not stand for any arrangement that physically sets the region apart from anywhere else in the UK.\nIts 2017 manifesto set out its position on Brexit and other issues, including:\nIts key slogan during the campaign turned out to be rather prescient: \"A vote for the DUP team is a vote to send 'Team Northern Ireland' to Westminster.  It is a team that has real influence\".\nAfter a tumultuous night for the Conservatives, Prime Minister Theresa May has lost her majority in the House of Commons, and the mandate she was expecting from the British people.\nBut with more seats than any other party, she has the first opportunity to form a government, but she needs to have an overall majority of 326 MPs to get legislation past the House of Commons.\nThe DUP plays a key role in this as their increased Northern Ireland majority of 10 seats could get Mrs May's Queen's Speech through parliament.\nAhead of the election, Northern Ireland's largest party made clear its preference was for a Conservative rather than Labour government.\nThe DUP's most senior MPs, including its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, have been consistently critical of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, particularly for his past links with Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in and his stance on security issues.", "summary": "The Democratic Unionists look set to be the powerbrokers in an election that intended to bring stability but has ended in a hung Parliament.", "id": "40217141", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe DUP is a socially conservative party, with a strong emphasis on the union with Britain.\nIt is also strongly opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage.\nThe party is also strongly opposed to the European Union and wants to leave the EU customs union.\nThe party is also strongly opposed to the European Union and wants to leave the EU customs union.

Popular among the England players, the 2005 Ashes winner has a close relationship with captain Alastair Cook and batsman Kevin Pietersen, whom he recently described as a \"million-pound asset\". Described by Clarke as a \"strong candidate\", Giles said he is \"very interested\" in the post.\nCons: Giles may be tarnished by his association with England's disastrous Ashes tour. He helped select the Test squad and oversaw the woeful showings in the one-day and Twenty20 series. If the ECB is looking for a fresh approach, then Giles is not the man.\nCoaching style: \"The fact he had to work hard for everything he achieved as a player helps Ashley as a coach,\" said former England captain Michael Vaughan. \"He had to graft for every wicket and run. He had to go to his room at night and think about his game, and analyse opponents. I have not known a player get on better with KP as well.

He coached England Lions on their West Indies tour in 2011 and has already put his name forward to succeed Flower.\nCons: The Lions tour aside, Newell has no international experience. He was Nottinghamshire coach during Pietersen's ill-fated spell with the county and had a difficult relationship with the South Africa-born batsman. \"Pietersen wasn't great for our team environment, so we had to cut him a lot of slack,\" Newell said in November. \"The evidence is not much has changed.\"\nCoaching style: \"My style is management as much as coaching, and that seems to be the way England have run things in recent years,\" said Newell last week.\nFormer Nottinghamshire and New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said: \"Mick is a very good manager.

He guided India to the top of the Test rankings and won the 2011 World Cup before taking on the head coach role with his home country. Kirsten established South Africa as the number one team in Test cricket, plotting series wins in England and Australia in 2012.\nCons: Kirsten ended his tenures in charge of India and South Africa in order to devote more time to his family and was quoted last week as saying he wants to spend 70% of his time at home in South Africa, with his wife and three young children.\nCoaching style: \"Gary Kirsten allows the natural instincts of players to flourish,\" said former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar. \"A lot has got to do with what's going on in a player's mind and Gary has played a huge role there.\"\nSouth Africa captain Graeme Smith said: \"More than anything, of all the coaches I have been under, Gary brings a much more relaxed, mature approach to the way he runs the team.\"\nAge: 48\nTeams coached: Worcestershire, Sri Lanka, Western Australia, Kings XI Punjab, Sunrisers Hyderabad\nBest odds: 10-1\nPros: Moody knows the English game well after long spells as a player and coach at Worcestershire. On the international scene, he coached Sri Lanka to the World Cup final in 2007 and was heavily tipped to succeed Duncan Fletcher as England coach before losing out to Peter Moores.\nCons: It is one thing to appoint an Australian as your bowling coach, but quite another to put one in charge of the England team across all three formats. Moody has been out of full-time coaching since 2010, splitting his time between commentating and short-term Twenty20 assignments.\nCoaching style: \"Tom can not only create a winning culture in the dressing room and groom players but also act as a father figure to them,\" said former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who worked under Moody at Worcestershire. \"That is how players are developed and made into world-class performers under pressure.\"\nAge: 53\nTeams coached: Natal, South Africa, Kent, Sri Lanka, Surrey\nBest odds: 10-1\nPros: If anyone can coax Kevin Pietersen back to his best, it is Ford. The South African has been a mentor to England's most talented, but difficult, batsman since his early days at Natal and was credited with helping him get back to form following a lean spell in 2010. The veteran coach has international experience with South Africa and Sri Lanka and knows the county scene after spending several years with Kent.\nCons: Ford is about to embark on a three-year contract with English county side Surrey. He was fired by South Africa in 2002 after losing home and away series to Australia.\nCoaching style: \"Graham Ford was brilliant for my confidence.

He gets his work via an agency.\nIn 2011, he made his way to Italy, where he paid traffickers \u00a32,500 for a false passport.\nBut when he flew into London, immigration officers realised his papers were fake.\nHe was fingerprinted and sent back to Italy.\nHe got another false passport and tried again, but he was deported for a second time.\nUndeterred, Victor tried to enter Britain from France by ferry. This time, he got in.\nHowever, before he could start work on construction sites, companies required him to provide them with a valid national insurance number.\nInstead of buying a set of fake documents, he paid someone to share their legitimate national insurance number with him.\n\"You find somebody who is British or [an] EU citizen and encourage them to help you, and we use their documents, photocopies, which would have our photographs on.\"\nHe says the other person is \"selling their identity\" to him.\nI hear Ana's bold jewellery jangling down the corridor leading up to the room where we meet.

When her visa ran out, she stayed on, working illegally as a housekeeper.\nBut in 2010, she was caught by immigration officers, fingerprinted and deported back to Brazil.\nShe quickly acquired a new Brazilian passport.  Six weeks after being kicked out of Britain, she flew to Italy, where she paid a man \u00a32,000 to accompany her back to the UK.\nWhen they landed, her companion walked her through the immigration hall.\nAs she recounts this part of her journey, she bites her lip nervously.\n\"After showing a piece of paper to the immigration officer, we were let through,\" she says.\nShe doesn't know how or why she was allowed in.\nShe says she was just overjoyed, adding that she loves the UK.\nEither immigration service systems failed to identify that Ana had been deported under her old passport or the person who accompanied her had arranged an \"inside job\".\nHowever, that seems unlikely given she arrived at a busy airport.\nShe is now working as a nanny for a family who she says are aware of her illegal migrant status.\nCan the UK Border Force deliver on the government's promises to make the UK an unattractive place for those who want to work illegally?\nHear BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme Working in the Shadows\nAli has seen better days.

It means the authorities cannot properly identify him or where he is from.\nIt therefore makes it very hard for them to know where to send him home. Added to that, some countries, including India and China, won't take people back unless they have the relevant paperwork to prove they are genuine nationals.\nThe irony for Ali is that he now wishes he could return home. Without a passport, he is stuck while the Indian authorities check his identity.\n\"It would be better if I had not come,\" he says.\nMaria is from Brazil.

The hourly rate works out at less than \u00a33.50 per hour, and the money is paid cash in hand.\nHer employer, who is also Brazilian, won't tolerate people taking time off because they're sick, and there's no holiday pay.\n\"We only get 10 minutes to eat,\" says Maria.\n\"If we do more than 12 hours [work], we don't get paid extra.

But it was already too late.\nAs life drained from his body, James and Hoa took it in turns to kiss him, before saying goodbye for the last time.\nOn his headstone, they wrote: \"Our little fighter, always remembered\".\nEach statistic is a tragedy.\nA life lost, a family suffering, loved ones bereaved. But each avoidable death is something else, too: a precious learning opportunity.\nMany of the deaths suffered in hospitals have patterns, what accident investigators call \"signatures\".\nWith open reporting and honest evaluation, new procedures could be put in place to ensure that the same mistake never happens again. But all too often, that's not the case.\nFive years before Joshua died, newborn Elleanor Bennett passed away at the same hospital, after staff failed to monitor her heart rate properly.\nThe consultant told the parents \"it was just one of those things\" and no independent investigation took place.\nWhen James Titcombe lost his son, he was met with similar evasions. Only because Mr Titcombe campaigned for more information, did he find answers.\nThe Kirkup report of 2015 found that 11 babies and a mother died in a 'lethal combination of failures' at every level of the system between 2004 and 2013.\nHad the lessons been learned earlier, these lives could have been saved.\nToday, a new approach to learning will come into legal effect in the NHS, with the establishment of an independent accident investigation branch.\nIt is modelled on aviation, an industry which has a very different response to failure.\nWhen two planes almost collide in mid-air - a near-miss event - both pilots can submit a report.\nThese reports are statistically analysed to learn the lessons to prevent an accident before it has even happened.\nAnd when a crash does happen, there are two almost indestructible black boxes (data recorders) that can be probed to learn the lessons.\nIn 1978, for example, a plane crashed in suburban Portland, Oregon, after the pilot had become focused on a malfunctioning light bulb, but lost focus on dwindling fuel reserves, which ultimately caused the accident.\nOn the surface, it looked like human error, but the black box investigation found uncanny similarities with other accidents.\nIt turned out that this was not a problem with the specific pilot, but with the limits of human perception.\nNew protocols were immediately introduced that addressed this problem.\nThese were designed to create a more structured division of responsibilities amongst the crew so that they could not become fixated on the wrong problem, and to improve communication.\nWhat happened? Accidents of this kind disappeared overnight.\nTen people died on the Portland flight, but the learning opportunity saved many thousands more.\nViewpoint: How creativity is helped by failure\nViewpoint: Should we all be looking for marginal gains?\nToday, aviation is arguably the safest form of transportation. Last year the accident rate had dropped to a low of only four fatal crashes from a total of 37.6 million flights.\nIndependent investigation is at the heart of this process. Professionals are given every reason to cooperate, because they know that investigations are not about finding scapegoats, but learning lessons.\nIndeed, professionals are given a legal safe space so they speak up honestly, and can be penalised only where negligence or malevolence is proven.\nIndependent investigation and safe space protection are equally vital in healthcare.\nStaff must be assured that when mistakes are caused by defective processes, they can speak up without being scapegoated.\nOnly by combating the \"blame culture\" in the NHS can transparency and meaningful change take place.\nHospitals that have developed a culture of open reporting have produced outstanding results.\nThe number of malpractice claims against the University of Illinois Medical Center, for example, fell by half in two years.\nVirginia Mason, a hospital in Seattle, has seen a fall in insurance liability premiums of a staggering 74%.\nAs Gary Kaplan, its chief executive, put it: \"We have a system that learns the lessons so that we can turn weaknesses into strengths\".\nThis is about more than healthcare and aviation, however.\nConsider, for example, how the success of British sport has been driven by a similar commitment to continual improvement.\nIn cycling, for example, there is a constant emphasis on discovering weaknesses so they can be turned into strengths.\nWhen Sir Dave Brailsford became head of British cycling, he was driven by insatiable curiosity to improve every single process.\nSo, he tested the bike design in a wind tunnel and tweaked it for a gain in aerodynamic efficiency.\nHe transported mattresses from stage to stage during the Tour de France for a marginal improvement in sleep quality.\nHe had the team use antibacterial hand gel to cut down on the risk of infection. The accumulation of these \"marginal gains\" has turned British cycling into the envy of the world.\nIf these sound like trivial issues, consider that until recently up to 60,000 deaths were caused annually in the United States by central line infections.\nOnly through proper investigation was it discovered that a key factor was clinicians failing to put sterile dressings over the catheter site; the medical equivalent of not using antibacterial hand gel.\nThe introduction of a five-point checklist - a marginal change - saved 1,500 lives over 18 months in the state of Michigan alone.\nAs a writer, I have seen the importance of a progressive culture again and again.\nIndeed, I wrote a book on the subject and, as a consequence, was invited by the Secretary of State for Health to help draft the proposals that come into force today.\nThe vast majority of NHS staff are diligent and heroic and have been long let down by a culture of blame.\nIndependent investigation is a crucial first step to drive down the avoidable errors that kill 150 people every week.\nMatthew Syed is the author of Black Box Thinking: The Surprising Truth About Success", "summary": "Copying the aviation industry and even professional cycling may help the NHS save lives, writes Matthew Syed.", "id": "35929557", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe NHS is a publicly funded healthcare system in the United Kingdom, which provides healthcare to all permanent residents of the United Kingdom, regardless of income.\nThe NHS was founded in 1948, and is funded from general taxation.\nThe NHS is the world's largest publicly funded healthcare system, measured by number of people covered.\nThe NHS is the world's third largest employer, after the Chinese Army", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe NHS is a great example of how to do things right.\nThe NHS has a culture of openness and transparency.\nIt has a five-point checklist that has saved 1,500 lives over 18 months in the state of Michigan alone.\nThe NHS has a culture of openness and transparency.\nIt has a five-point checklist that has saved 1,500 lives over 18 months", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe NHS is a national health service.

blamed on foreign powers - that were sparked by the disputed 2009 presidential election.\nWhen Baroness Ashton first landed in Tehran last weekend, moderate newspapers hailed her arrival as an \"achievement\" of the reformist President Hassan Rouhani.\nHis Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has established a good working relationship with Europe's top diplomat during their months of negotiations which led to November's landmark interim deal on Iran's nuclear programme.\nNow Mr Zarif, as well as Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, has been summoned to appear before parliament to answer questions.\nHardliners have zeroed in on what is being denounced as Baroness Ashton's \"controversial meeting\".\nTheir target is a small gathering with seven female human rights activists at the very start of her mission, which coincided with International Women's Day.\nThe presence of Narges Mohammadi, the acting head of Iran's Centre for the Defenders of Human Rights, attracted some of the greatest attention.\nShe has been to prison five times since her days as a student activist, and is now on bail.\n\"The better Iran's relations with the world become, the more open the political climate in Iran becomes, and the more active our civil society,\" Ms Mohammadi told me.\nBaroness Ashton spoke of \"the great privilege to meet women to talk about issues for women in Iran and across the world,\" as she stood next to Mr Zarif at a news conference on Sunday.\nOn Wednesday, a small crowd of protesters, mainly from an Islamic Association of University Students, gathered outside the residence of the Austrian ambassador in Tehran where the meeting with the female activists - meant to be a low-key discussion - was held the previous Saturday evening.\n\"If Mrs Ashton is concerned about women and human rights, she should go take care of the women in Europe,\" one student association declared earlier this week.\n\"This backlash was to be expected,\" a prominent editor of one of Iran's conservative media told me. \"It will subside.\"\nBut it is also clear the deeply-rooted suspicion will not go away.\nHardline politicians, still smarting from President Rouhani's emphatic victory in last year's elections, also see this as an opportunity to step up the pressure to try to weaken the reformist government, including negotiations on the future of Iran's nuclear programme.\n\"They will try to keep the flame alive,\" said one Iranian commentator.\nThere has been less comment so far from more moderate media.\nBut a cautious appreciation of her visit was quoted earlier this week.\n\"It can have a positive effect on the process of Iran's nuclear talks and the promotion of our country's relations with the European Union,\" remarked Ahmad Shohani, a member of the parliament's security and foreign policy committee.\nAs we walked through Tehran's crowded bazaars this week, Iranians often asked us what kind of impact her visit would have.\n\"When senior officials visit it gives us hope,\" said Mehdi whose family has been in the carpet business for more than three decades. \"When more junior officials come, we worry.\"\n\"We definitely welcome her visit,\" emphasised a woman carrying bags of Iranian nuts and sweets in preparation for the upcoming Persian New Year on 21 March. \"It's not good to live in isolation.\"\n\"Ashton and her friends should deal with the government,\" insisted another man who lamented the high prices caused by years of international sanctions. \"We cannot make a long wall around ourselves but the EU and the Iranian government have to show good intentions.\"\nBaroness Ashton was clear from the start that human rights were an important part of her greater engagement with Iran.\nShe often makes a point of talking to women wherever she visits.\n\"She would have been criticised if she did not reach out to Iranian women, especially since it was International Women's Day,\" commented one of her advisers.\nHer approach in Iran was carefully framed as a \"potential human rights dialogue in future\".\nEuropean diplomats say the idea to put human rights on the agenda was first suggested by Iran's delegation during a meeting at the United Nations in September.\nBoth Baroness Ashton and the Iranian leaders she met in Tehran have spoken positively about their talks earlier this week.\n\"I've met people who've played a role in Iran, not just now but historically, and we were able to talk about the potential to do other things, including human rights,\" Baroness Ashton told me and the few other journalists who came to cover her visit.\nAfter meeting her, President Hassan Rouhani spoke of the need to \"interact constructively\" with the entire world, including Europe, based on \"common interests and mutual respect\".\nHis unofficial Twitter account @HassanRouhani used the hashtag #Constructive_Engagement.\nMr Minister Zarif also spoke about the potential to co-operate in other areas, including action against drug trafficking from neighbouring Afghanistan, the battle against \"terrorism\", and the \"dangerous\" situation in Syria.\nBut Baroness Ashton also made it clear that progress on any front would depend on the success or failure of difficult talks on a long-term comprehensive nuclear accord, which will resume on 17 March in Vienna.\n\"I am leaving here knowing there is support for those who are going to come to negotiate,\" she told me. \"But there's so much to do and we have to be cautiously optimistic.\"\nEven deeper scepticism was reiterated again this week by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\"Our officials have started negotiations.

The University of Tallin in the country's capital capital absorbed eight smaller institutes and colleges.\nIn Denmark, the number of universities was reduced from 12 to eight and government research centres integrated into the university sector.\nFrance now leads the way with mergers with a government-inspired initiative to gather universities and research centres into umbrella-like communities - \"communes\" - and then to consider full mergers.\nOne of the biggest amalgamations, the Paris-Saclay \"federal university\", includes the highly-ranked Ecole Polytechnique, the HEC business school and Universite Paris-Sud.\nThis has the explicit aim of creating a institution which will be in the top 10 of global rankings.\nNow it looks like Paris will go one step further, following successful university mergers in Strasbourg, Bordeaux and Marseille.\nIn the heart of the Latin Quarter, two of the French capital's most prestigious institutions - Paris-Sorbonne and Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC) Universities - are planning to recreate the spirit of the old unified University of Paris which was torn apart after the student riots of 1968.\nBack then, the French government allowed the University of Paris - one of the oldest in the world, founded around 1150 - to split into 13 autonomous universities along faculty lines, often referred to as Paris 1, 2, 3 and so on up to 13.\nProfessor Jean Chambaz, president of UPMC - Paris 6 - said: \"One of the limitations of French universities came about 40 years ago when they separated along disciplinary lines.\n\"One had all sciences, another only the humanities, another just law and economics.\n\"We were the science and medical faculties of the Sorbonne, of the University of Paris, before the split in 1970.\"\n\"Today UPMC's focus is science, engineering and medicine; at Paris-Sorbonne it is arts and humanities. But to address the challenges of the world, we need to build a comprehensive university containing all these disciplines.\n\"At the moment in Paris, we don't have mergers, but autonomous institutions working in partnership, like our own Sorbonne University group, which includes research centres, the private INSEAD business school, as well as Paris-Sorbonne, UPMC and some other institutions.\n\"In February, we will have elections for presidents and boards of both Paris-Sorbonne and UPMC. Providing the new members agree, we will press ahead with a full merger and create the new university by 1 January 2018.\n\"In some ways we are recreating the old Sorbonne, but in the 21st Century.\"\nProfessor Barthelemy Jobert, president of Paris-Sorbonne University - Paris 4 - is enthusiastic about creating a powerful global research university covering all disciplines and capable of rivalling the best in the world.\n\"Success will be creating a new model of a global university in France, with independent autonomous faculties as well as a presidency who will speak for the whole university.\"\nThe French government favours such mergers, but is leaving it to the universities to decide.\nProfessors Jobert and Chambaz see eye-to-eye on the merger, but say it is vital to win support from academics, technical and administrative staff and students.\nProf Chambaz says they are learning from other European examples of successful government-backed mergers, such as Germany's Karlsruhe University and Karlsruhe Research Centre merging into Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).\nWith the goal of repeating the success of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, KIT has increased student numbers by 20% since 2009 and concentrated research on fields such as energy and mobility.\nIt enjoyed a 50% boost to research income between 2009 and 2013.\nThe new Aalto University in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, had government backing to combine institutions.\nHelsinki School of Economics, Helsinki University of Technology and the University of Arts and Design, Helsinki were merged, with the aim of turbo-charging Finland's higher education system.\nIt wanted to tackle the relative poor performance of Finland's universities, compared with the country's top ratings at school level in the Pisa test rankings.\n\"The new university was designed to put innovation and impact on the knowledge economy at the heart of things,\" said Aalto's vice president, Hannu Seristo.\nAnd the new bigger university climbed almost 50 places in this year's QS rankings.\nBut not all mergers are so enthusiastically supported by government.\nThe University of Lisbon and Technical University of Lisbon, Portugal, had to \"actively convince\" public authorities to secure approval to merge into Universidade de Lisboa and justify the costs involved.\nAnd that's just the point, says Mr Estermann. \"Mergers need a lot of time and energy to be successful.

The report details how, at a time of extraordinary stress, they experienced a lack of compassion, poor counselling and badly handled complaints.\nHundreds of children are treated at the Leeds unit every year so 16 families represents a tiny minority who had a bad experience.\nBut the report makes clear that every single one of them is entitled to the best possible care.\nIn the words of this report, their stories need to be not just listened to but heard.\nHe told the Today programme the behaviour of politicians who had campaigned to save the unit had been \"downright disgraceful\" and that children should be cared for in an \"atmosphere that was caring and compassionate\".\nHe said there had been an \"overwhelming consensus\" in about 2006 that the NHS needed fewer larger child surgical centres that could provide a \"comprehensive and safe service\".\nMichelle Elliot, whose daughter Jessica was left with brain damage after her treatment at Leeds, said changes still needed to be made.\n\"There are numerous recommendations for the trust to work on as part of that report,\" Ms Elliot said.\n\"So it's very unfair, I feel, to say it has a clean bill of health because it doesn't.\"\nHer daughter had a stroke as she awaited a heart transplant and remains in a wheelchair.\n\"We're the lucky ones. She's still with us,\" Ms Elliot said.\n\"There are many families in the group whose children and babies have died.\"\nShe added there had been \"a lack of kindness, a lack of action, a lack of belief in the parents\".\nOne parent, who has not been named, told investigators they were given \"no support\" by staff after their daughter had died.\n\"We were given a leaflet,\" they said.\n\"Nobody asked how we were getting home in the early hours of the morning.\"\nAnother parent described how a book had gone missing in which their son had been writing about his experiences before his death.\nA fourth, a mother, described how she felt pressurised into having an abortion, which was against her beliefs as a Muslim.\nJulian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said he was \"so sorry\" for those families and offered them a \"heartfelt apology\".\nHe said: \"Although we treat 10,000 children a year and do 800 operations, one poor experience is one too many.\"\nA number of actions had already been taken to improve service at the unit, Mr Hartley said.\nThese included the appointment of three permanent consultant surgeons, a full review of how complaints are handled and the opening of a new \u00c2\u00a31.75m children's intensive care unit.\n\"We commit to making sure we derive every ounce of learning from their experience,\" said Mr Hartley.\nSharon Cheng, of the Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Fund, a charity giving support for children and adults born with congenital heart defects and their families, said she was \"surprised\" to read the critical comments.\n\"The trust has learned from this. I know things have been put in place since to address these issues and my sympathy goes out to those families. The whole country has to learn from this.\"\nBut Fragile Hearts, a group representing parents who have lost children or seen them suffer medical harm as a result of heart surgery, said the report was \"evidence the culture which exists at LGI heart unit takes no account of the emotional, psychological or spiritual needs of children or parents\".\nIn a statement, Fragile Hearts said its members did not believe the changes introduced at the unit went far enough.\n\"We believe that the changes required are not only in the skill and care provided but in the attitude of those care providers.\n\"We therefore call for systemic changes within the unit, but above all we hope that nobody else ever has to walk in our shoes.\"\nThe Children's Heart Foundation said other concerns, which it had raised

"Matty Taylor netted on his full debut and Tammy Abraham scored twice from close range as the Robins dominated an abject home side in the first half.\nHeaders from Bent and Tom Ince, though, set up a thrilling finale.\nAnd Bent's penalty, after Scott Golbourne fouled Ince, denied City a third away league win of the season.\nBent's composure from the spot - for his sixth goal in seven games - took the Rams to within five points of the play-off places, and came after a second-half performance which was in stark contrast to a miserable opening period when the Rams lacked both urgency and quality.\nTaylor's tap-in, in his second match after a controversial move from Bristol Rovers, put the visitors ahead.\nThey wasted several chances to double the lead before Abraham's double - the first set up after a flowing team move and both involving the excellent Taylor - seemingly settled the match by the break.\nA second successive City win, which would have taken them five points clear of the relegation zone, started to look in doubt as the Rams hit back through Bent's diving header and Ince's downward header.\nAnd Bent's coolly taken penalty made it 3-3 with 10 minutes left, but the Robins survived some strong home pressure to go home with one point.\nDerby boss Steve McClaren: \"For the neutral it was one hell of a game, but we talk about game ready or game head on and we didn't have it on first half, it's as simple as that.\n\"You can't do that against any opponent. We had to change attitude and it was up to the players to respond, which they did, but I think it's a lesson for us.\n\"We said that at the end, it's a lesson and if you're not right and your game head isn't on, you can lose to anyone.\n\"It was Jekyll and Hyde, we know the direction we want to take and it's up to the players.\"\nBristol City head coach Lee Johnson: \"You know when your kid runs out in the road and you quickly grab them back in and you don't know whether to give them a smack on the bum or a cuddle, that's how I feel.\n\"So much of our work was excellent today, the way the players passed and moved the ball in the first half, and even in the second we created numerous really good chances and could have scored six.\n\"But obviously I'm massively disappointed, I'd be lying if I told you I was happy with the group and taking a point from a winning position and three goals up.\n\"We are very, very close to being a decent side but we've got to learn and grow together.\"\nMatch ends, Derby County 3, Bristol City 3.\nSecond Half ends, Derby County 3, Bristol City 3.\nAttempt blocked.

After her, they sang about themselves - their fears, their pain, and how the loss of a lover can leave you feeling: \"The bed's too big, the frying pan's too wide.\"\nHer reputation as a fragile, confessional lyricist does her a disservice. Mitchell's writing may be unflinchingly personal, but it is also rich with imagery and engaged with the world beyond her \"yellow curtains\".\n\"My work has always contained the question of how far the pop song could go. What themes it could hold without collapsing,\" she once said.\nHer most famous compositions are the poem-songs she released during her early, Laurel Canyon years, but she was incorporating jazz and world music in her work long before it became fashionable.\n\"My music is not designed to grab instantly,\" she once said. \"It's designed to wear for a lifetime, to hold up like a fine cloth.\"\nIt would be impossible to select a definitive list of her best songs, but here is a quick guide to seven of the most popular ones.\nCovered more than 200 times by the likes of Tori Amos, Herbie Hancock, Linda Ronstadt and Aimee Mann, River is one of Mitchell's most enduring songs.\nFeatured on 1971's Blue album, its spare, piano-driven arrangement paints a vivid picture of loss and self-recrimination, with Mitchell facing Christmas with no-one to kiss under the mistletoe.\nKey lyric: \"I wish I had a river I could skate away on / I wish I had a river so long / I would teach my feet to fly.\"\nMade famous by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, whose hard-rocking version is a stark contrast to Mitchell's stripped-down, intimate performance where her multi-tracked voice is set against a simple Wurlitzer electric piano.\nA tribute to the 1969 festival of peace, love and music, the song is quiet and thoughtful when the event was anything but.\nMitchell famously did not attend Woodstock, basing her lyrics on the (undoubtedly hazy) recollections of her then-boyfriend, Graham Nash.\nKey lyric: \"We are stardust / We are golden/ And we've got to get ourselves / Back to the garden.\"\nA devastatingly gorgeous ballad, A Case Of You captures the nuances and complications of an affair in its dissolution.\n\"You are in my blood like holy wine,\" sings Mitchell, seemingly drunk on love, before delivering the killer blow: \"I could drink a case of you and still be on my feet.\"\nBut the song also captures her ambiguity over ending the relationship: \"Love is touching souls / Surely you touched mine / 'Cause part of you pours out of me / In these lines from time to time.\"\nArguably Mitchell's best composition, A Case Of You is tucked away at the end of Blue, and exemplifies the album's searingly intense lyrics.\n\"The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals,\" she told Cameron Crowe in a 1979 interview for Rolling Stone.\n\"At that period in my life, I had no personal defences. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes.\n\"I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defences there either.\"\nKey lyric: \"I could drink a case of you / And still be on my feet.\"\nA reflection on the demands of fame, Free Man In Paris is more exuberant and funny than most musicians' stories of \"screaming in a hotel room\".\nMitchell adopts the voice of her record-executive friend David Geffen as he enjoys a worry-free weekend in France, neatly capturing the tension between having power and wanting freedom.\nKey lyric: 'I was a free man in Paris / I felt unfettered and alive / There was nobody calling me up for favours / And no one's future to decide / You know I'd go back there tomorrow / But for the work I've taken on / Stoking the star-maker machinery / Behind the popular song.\"\nAn upbeat sing-along that hides a message about imminent ecological disaster, Big Yellow Taxi is Mitchell's biggest radio hit - and her only top 40 single in the UK, reaching number 11 in 1970.\nShe wrote it after a trip to Hawaii, where she arrived at her hotel in the dead of night.\n\"When I woke up the next morning, I threw back the curtains and saw these beautiful green mountains in the distance. Then, I looked down and there was a parking lot as far as the eye could see, and it broke my heart... this blight on paradise. That's when I sat down and wrote the song.\"\nKey lyric: \"They paved paradise / And put up a parking lot.\"\nMitchell's biggest hit in the States, Help Me is one of her most straightforward compositions - a shimmering, swooning love song that largely adheres to pop's verse-chorus structures.\nIt finds the singer helplessly falling for a man she knows is bad news: \"A rambler and a gambler and a sweet-talking-ladies man.\"\nIt's a favourite of funk musician Prince, who references it in The Ballad of Dorothy Parker, from his 1987 album Sign O The Times.\nKey lyric: \"Help me / I think I'm falling in love again / When I get that crazy feeling, I know / I'm in trouble again.\"\nWritten in 1967 and originally recorded by Judy Collins, Both Sides Now stemmed from the failure of Mitchell's first marriage and her decision to give up her daughter for adoption.\nIt uses clouds as a metaphor for the loss of innocence - how a child pictures \"ice cream castles in the air\", but adults only see a portent of bad weather.\nWritten when she was 21, the world-weary lyrics sat uncomfortably on Mitchell's young shoulders - but her 2000 re-recording is darker and wiser.\n\"It took a mature woman to bring it to life,\" Mitchell once said.\nKey lyric: \"I've looked at love from both sides now / From give and take and still somehow /It's love's illusions I recall.\"", "summary": "Joni Mitchell describes herself as a \"painter who writes songs\" with a \"little helium voice\".", "id": "32143868", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"I've looked at love from both sides now / From give and take and still somehow /It's love's illusions I recall.\"\nMitchell's most famous song, and one of the most covered in the world, is a haunting, heartbreaking tale of a woman who has lost her lover to another woman.\nThe song's lyrics are ambiguous, but it's widely believed to be about Mitchell's relationship with", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\"I've looked at love from both sides now / From loss and gain and still somehow / It's love's illusions I recall.\"\nA song about the pain of losing a lover, and the fear of being alone, this is one of Mitchell's most personal compositions.\nIt's also one of her most beautiful, with a melody that's as simple as it is heartbreaking.\nKey lyric: \"I'm so", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\"I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore / I'm", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\"I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore.\"\nMitchell's most famous song, and her most famous album, is a meditation on the inevitability of death.\nKey lyric: \"I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore.\"\nKey lyric: \"I'm not a child anymore / I'm not a child anymore.\"\nKey lyric: \"I'm not", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\"I've looked at love from both sides now / From give and take and still somehow /It's love's illusions I recall.\"\nMitchell's first hit, Big Yellow Taxi is a witty, wry song about the destruction of the environment.\nIt was inspired by a trip to Hawaii, where she arrived at her hotel in the dead of night.\n\"When I woke up the next morning, I threw back the", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\"I'm not sure if I'm a child or a mother.\"\nA song about the death of her mother, Chelsea Morning is a haunting, beautifully-crafted song that finds Mitchell at her most vulnerable.\n\"I was 21 when my mother died,\" she once said. \"I was a child.

the score was 17-17 in Paris last March - and it was another absorbing, if at times desperate, contest this time around.\n(provided by accenture)\nFrance, whose final game of the tournament is against Scotland in Paris next weekend, had been in danger of being whitewashed in the tournament for the first time in 56 years.\nHowever, despite managing to grab a draw, head coach Philippe Saint-Andre will struggle to keep his job, whether his side beat Scotland or not.\nFor Ireland head coach Declan Kidney, victory over France would have provided welcome respite following a fortnight of speculation over his future - his contract is up after this year's tournament after almost five years in the job.\nBut his side having failed to beat Scotland in Murrayfield a fortnight ago, despite huge advantages in terms of territory and possession, and now failed to finish off an insipid France team, the writing may now be on the wall.\nWith the wind billowing around Aviva Stadium and a blanket of rain enveloping players and spectators alike, the game was always going to be characterised more by mistakes than free-flowing rugby.\nIndeed, a couple of handling errors under the high ball set the tone before Ireland's forwards began to make large dents with their driving maul, a tactic the French had little answer to.\nOne drive, with Sean O'Brien at its rear, travelled fully 15 metres into French territory and the hosts scored their first try from a second shortly after, Heaslip burrowing over from short range.\nJackson, in the side ahead of the injured Jonathan Sexton and discarded Ronan O'Gara, added the extras.\nFrance fly-half Michalak, back in the starting line-up after losing his place to Francois Trinh-Duc for the game against England, missed a makeable penalty chance after 15 minutes and the visiting team did little to warm the cockles of their large travelling contingent of fans in the opening quarter.\nIreland should have extended their lead when France went over the top at a ruck but Jackson missed a penalty from centre-field, before Michalak got his side on the scoreboard with a three-pointer after the host's scrum disintegrated.\nUlster's Jackson, playing in only his second full international, steadied the nerves with a long-range penalty 11 minutes before half-time and added another from almost the identical spot three minutes later as errors continued to flow from the French.\nMuch was said before the game about the need for Ireland to put France on the back foot from the opening whistle and break them psychologically and so it panned out in the first half, with France, who were clueless in attack, never able to recover their composure after those early Irish mauls.\nMichalak missed a difficult penalty attempt on the stroke of half-time and France, for whom skipper Thierry Dusautoir had been tireless in defence in a losing cause, were booed off by their fans.\nWhen Louis Picamoles dropped the ball from Jackson's restart it was apparent it would be more of the same from a beleaguered French outfit in the second half.\nIreland should have added points after several waves of attack but desperate French defence and an ill-judged Rob Kearney drop-goal attempt let the visitors off the hook.\nMorgan Parra took over kicking duties in the second half and slotted a three-pointer after 52 minutes to keep France alive but scuffed his second attempt at goal after Ireland went off-side.\nIreland began to lose their way as the second half went on, forgetting the pragmatic tactics that won them the first half, namely tight forward play and clever territorial kicking.\nBut while France were beginning to dominate in the scrum, Michalak, who had another poor day at the office in open play, was unable to spring anything worthwhile in attack.\nWhen France did finally create some space, full-back Yoann Huget butchered the opportunity, ignoring the overlap and going into contact instead.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut France did cross soon afterwards, Picamoles reaching over for the try after a sustained period of pressure on the Irish line. Michalak levelled the scores with a difficult kick from just inside the left touch-line.\nIreland nearly nicked the win with four minutes remaining, Picamoles, who put in a monumental shift for France, just beating Keith Earls to the touch-down after a kick ahead. And the hosts were unlucky not to have won a penalty as it appeared Vincent Debaty had taken Earls out without the ball.\nFrance had one last throw of the dice but with Ireland defenders out on their feet and no time left on the clock, Michalak decided to kick ahead, a move that rather typified French decision making.\nIRELAND: Kearney, McFadden, O'Driscoll, L.

in the US, other concerns are sometimes given priority.\nPersonal data should no longer be transferred to US bodies solely on the basis they are Safe Harbour-certified.\nInstead to authorise the \"export\" of the data, the two bodies involved must draw up and sign what's referred to as \"model contract clauses\", which set out the US organisation's privacy obligations.\n\"It will involve lots of contracts between lots of parties and it's going to be a bit of a nightmare administratively,\" commented Nicola Fulford, head of data protection at the UK law firm Kemp Little.\n\"The model clauses themselves are standard form - what you need to put into them are details of the data involved and the security steps being taken.\n\"It's not that we're going to be negotiating them individually, as the legal terms are mostly fixed, but it does mean a lot more paperwork and they have legal implications.\"\nAll of this will drive up costs and potentially cause delays.\nIt depends on who you speak to.\nThe big-name firms are being guarded about what they say.\nSources at one firm suggest it believes it already has all the necessary contracts drawn up and processes in place to avoid any disruption.\nBut an insider at another company suggests that it may have to alter or stop some of its data transfers across the Atlantic.\nWhat everyone agrees on, however, is that the ruling will have wider impact.\n\"It's not just about companies whose core activities is data processing - i.e. the Facebooks of the world - it's the companies who don't have data processing capabilities of their own and transfer personal data abroad to get it done,\" explains Allie Renison from the UK's Institute of Directors.\n\"So, if you're a company that sends payroll data for administrative purposes across to the US, that becomes an issue.\n\"Likewise, it affects you if you're a firm trying to send over data about your customers for a marketing campaign.\"\nYes - but few expected the court to rule on the matter so quickly.\nHaving said that, while some data privacy regulators - including the UK and Ireland's - said they were satisfied with Safe Harbour's stamp of approval, Germany's watchdogs raised concerns years ago.\nAs far back as 2010, they told local firms they were still obliged to check whether Safe Harbour-certified organisations were actually taking adequate measures, and suggested they draw up model contract clauses to avoid any doubt.\nPotentially, yes.\nIf people challenge whether adequate steps to protect their data are being taken, the regulators may now need to intervene.\nMax Schrems certainly intends to try again to make the Irish Data Protection Commissioner look into Facebook.\nIt should, however, be stressed that the social network strongly denies providing \"backdoor\" access to the US intelligence agencies.\nYes - but that's not as simple as it sounds.\nThe US and EU have in fact been negotiating to update the Safe Harbour pact for nearly two years, and won't say when they hope to conclude a deal.\nFollowing Snowden's leaks, the EU sought to limit the circumstances under which the US authorities could access transferred data, and threatened to veto any future trade agreements if a new deal was not stuck.\nBut despite repeated reports that an agreement was close, the two sides have failed to agree terms.\nTo further complicate matters, they recently agreed in principle a separate data-sharing deal called the Umbrella Agreement, which governs how their law enforcement agencies share data.\nBut the EU has said it would only finalise the pact if Europeans are given the right to sue US companies in American courts for misusing their data.\nThe US seemed set to agree, but now its politicians may retaliate against the ECJ's ruling by refusing to grant the privilege.", "summary": "A pact that helped the tech giants and others send personal data from the EU to the US has been ruled invalid.", "id": "34442618", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe European Court of Justice said that the Safe Harbour agreement did not eliminate the need for local privacy watchdogs to check US firms were taking adequate data protection measures.

Centre-back Giuseppe Bellusci and goalkeeper Marco Silvestri both failed to clear, allowing Oliveira to go on and tap into an empty net.\nMills then had a header cleared off the line by Luke Murphy, and Forest substitute Jamie Ward had a shot turned over by Silvestri before Leeds mounted a late challenge.\nByram, whose contract expires at the end of the season and is expected to be sold in January, picked the ball up in space in a central area and shot low into the corner.\nLeeds substitute Mirco Antenucci then sliced badly wide as Steve Evans' side came to life, with Chris Wood fluffing a close-range effort straight at Dorus de Vries.\nIt was Forest who came closer to winning a sixth home Championship game in a row though when Burke's miscued volley beat Silvestri and hit the base of the post.\nThe draw extends both sides' unbeaten records and leaves Leeds in 12th and Forest 13th in the Championship table - seven and eight points behind the play-off places respectively.\nNottingham Forest boss Dougie Freedman talking to the club website:\n\"I was trying to go and win the game two or three-nil because that's the only way you can beat Leeds. Doing so, I increase my chances of losing but also of winning.\n\"We felt if we had a good structure we could hit them on the counter attack. I felt it was a gameplan that was working.\n\"Credit to Leeds, their fans demand their team goes for 95 minutes and they did that. I didn't see my goalkeeper get worked too much. Of course we're disappointed with the goal but it was a fantastic strike.\"\nLeeds manager Steve Evans on Sky Sports:\n\"If it's a boxing match the towel would have come in. For all our dominance we made a mistake on the breakaway.\n\"Some of our play in the second half was exceptional. We opened them up a number of times and on another day we go on to win.\n\"I am a manager that wants the lads to be brave and pass it, I am going to encourage them to keep trying to pass it.\"\nMatch ends, Nottingham Forest 1, Leeds United 1.\nSecond Half ends, Nottingham Forest 1, Leeds United 1.\nAttempt missed.

It's almost as if the Pyramid Stage is cursed...\nBut who is likely to step in for the Foo Fighters on 26 June?\nAlready on the bill, and basking in the afterglow of their third number one album, Florence and the Machine are the most likely choice.\nProven festival headliners with a set of earthy, mystical songs they fit neatly with the Glastonbury ethos.\nHits like Kiss With A Fist and Shake It Up will sound perfect as the sun sets in Somerset, and their promotion up the bill would help settle a gender imbalance.\nBut singer Florence Welch should be wary of the curse of the Pyramid Stage - she broke her foot while playing Coachella in April.\nNever bad at Glastonbury, the Britpop survivors played the gig of their lifetime at the 2009 festival. The set was so emotional, Damon Albarn even broke into tears after To The End.\nA brilliant new album, The Magic Whip, would stop a 2015 set being a repeat performance with songs like Ong Ong and Lonesome Street going down particularly well at the Isle of Wight Festival last weekend.\nAlbarn also has form in helping Glastonbury out of a crisis - he brought his animated hip-hop collective Gorillaz to the main stage when U2 dropped out in 2010. Although it was a poorly received set.\nA natural substitute for the hard-rocking riffage of the Foo Fighters, AC/DC were widely rumoured to be in the frame for Glastonbury earlier this year.\nBut the band poured cold water on the story, with frontman Brian Johnson describing the festival as \"wellies and corporate\".\nBut after hearing Metallica had played in 2014, their attitude softened. \"If they ask\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 OK,\" said guitarist Angus Young.\nDetractors say the band has been writing the same exact song over and over for years - but it's a pretty good song, and Glastonbury would be a perfect place to air Highway to Hell and Back in Black.\nLuckily, they're between dates on their European tour on 26 June.\nEmily Eavis probably has Chris Martin on speed dial. The band are a reliable Glastonbury stalwart, with anthems aplenty.\nGlastonbury also gave the band a considerable leg up in 2005, when they were booked to lead the Pyramid Stage while still relatively untested. Nevertheless, they were the talk of the festival afterwards, thanks to a particularly heartfelt rendition of The Scientist.\nA headline slot would give fans a rare chance to hear last year's well-received Ghost Stories album live - the group only played two UK dates on their brief world tour.\nBut they might want to hold fire until next year. Chris Martin has hinted the band's seventh studio album could be their swansong.\nAssuming Dave Grohl, the nicest man in rock, doesn't want to leave Glastonbury in the lurch, he could put in a call to his good friends Queens of the Stone Age.\nJosh Homme's band played a blistering headline set on Glastonbury's Other Stage in 2013, drawing a sizeable crowd despite being scheduled against Beyonce.\nThey're currently in the recording studio, but have scheduled to play Rock in Rio this September, which means they could be battle ready.\nA popular suggestion on social media, Swift is certainly riding a wave this year, thanks to the  unassailable pop of her new album 1989.\nHandily, she's in the UK next week and has Friday night off before playing the BST festival in Hyde Park the following day.\nBut it's been a long time since Glastonbury booked such an unashamedly commercial act as its headliner - and while the crowd would undoubtedly lap up Shake It Off and Blank Space, they might find the country elements of her set unpalatable.\nMaybe she could win the crowd over with a headbanging cover the Foo Fighters' Best of You?\nEvery year, a rumour sweeps around Glastonbury that Daft Punk are \"definitely\" playing a secret set over the weekend.\nWhy should this year be any different?\nSee above.\nHe's been listed as a potential headliner for years, and at one point looked set to sign up for   2015.  For whatever reason, negotiations fell apart but a last-minute booking would suit the star's hit-and-run philosophy.\nIf the Minneapolis musician did pop, it would undoubtedly go down as one of Glastonbury's legendary performances. He's at the top of his game, thanks to his muscular, perfectly-drilled new band 3rd Eye Girl - and, as he's fond of telling audiences: \"I got so many hits we don't have time to play 'em all.\"\nBut even just the staples of his set - Raspberry Beret, Purple Rain, Let's Go Crazy, Kiss, Little Red Corvette - would be the envy of any headliner.\nThe Chain, Don't Stop, Tusk, Black Magic Woman - Fleetwood Mac have no shortage of hits to supply to the Pyramid Stage. But, it seems, they're not that keen on travelling down to Somerset.\nTheir Isle Of Wight set last weekend was billed as a \"worldwide festival exclusive\", and organiser John Giddings claimed Glastonbury bosses were green with envy.\n\"Michael Eavis said, 'How did you get Fleetwood Mac?' I said, 'I paid them!'\" he told Music Week.\nIf the band were to capitulate, though, they'd have to cancel or postpone a show at London's O2 Arena, which is booked for the same night.\nMuse last headlined Glastonbury in 2010, welcoming The Edge on stage in the year that U2 were forced to pull out.\nTheir star has waned in the intervening years (with the critics, at least) but they are still a thrilling, compelling live act.\nOn their new album, Drones, they've ditched the frilly faux-operatics of their more recent work in favour of proto-metal riffs and Matt Bellamy's soaring vocals.\nThe opportunity to hear Knights of Cydonia charging over the fields of Worthy Farm again is not one to be be missed - but there's one small problem.

Where there is any racism in the party... it will be rooted out.\"\nMP John Mann, who called Mr Livingstone a \"Nazi apologist\" in a public confrontation, has been reprimanded.\nThe Labour MP had been referring to comments Mr Livingstone made about Adolf Hitler.\nThe row was prompted by the suspension of Labour MP Naz Shah over comments she made about Israel on social media.\nMr Livingstone appeared on BBC Radio London defending her and said he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic.\nHe added: \"When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\"\nLabour MP John Mann then accused Mr Livingstone of being a \"Nazi apologist\" in front of a media scrum as he arrived at Westminster's media studios.\nAsked about the confrontation on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Livingstone said Mr Mann \"went completely over the top\" but Mr Mann stood by his remarks.\nMr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, saying the Nazi leader was \"a monster from start to finish\", but he said he had simply been quoting historical \"facts\".\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his long-time ally had been suspended amid \"very grave concerns about the language he used in the interview this morning\" and would face an investigation by the party.\nHe told BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar: \"Anybody that thinks this party is not cracking down on anti-Semitism is simply wrong. We have suspended where appropriate, we have investigated all cases. We will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form whatsoever in the party.\"\nAsked if there was a crisis in the party, he said: \"It's not a crisis. There's no crisis. Where there is any racism in the party it will be dealt with, it will be rooted out.\"\nHe said those who suggested the party was in crisis were \"nervous of the strength of the Labour Party at local level\".\nMeanwhile, a Labour spokesman said John Mann was told it was \"completely inappropriate for Labour Members of Parliament to be involved in very public rows on the television\".\nFor years it has been more surprising when Ken Livingstone hasn't raised hackles than when he has.\nThat's why so many Labour MPs feared a miscalculation when their party's leader brought his old comrade back into the fold.\nBut his staggering comments today about Hitler and anti-Semitism crossed a line - they were enough for Jeremy Corbyn to suspend him.\nBut the problem for the leader doesn't end with that act.\nNo one believes that Jeremy Corbyn himself tolerates discrimination against Jews.\nBut on repeated occasions Labour has been slow and clumsy in closing down cases of anti-Semitism among its members when they emerge.\nAny moments of delay or doubts about the leadership's determination, open the window a tiny crack to the kind of intolerance that the vast majority of the Labour Party, and indeed the public, find appalling.\nPublic denials that there is even an issue could make it even worse. Perhaps in politics as in normal life, the first step towards fixing a problem is acknowledging that it exists.\nAnd with only a week before Jeremy Corbyn's first big test at the polls, In elections in London, Scotland, Wales, and all round England, it's the kind of mess, and political distraction Labour could do without.\nOn Wednesday Labour MP Naz Shah was suspended, pending an investigation, over comments she made on Facebook before she became an MP, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States.\nShe has apologised but it sparked fresh claims from senior Labour figures that the party was not doing enough to tackle growing anti-Semitism in its ranks.\nShadow Commons leader Chris Bryant told MPs: \"I'm sick and tired of people trying to explain it away and, yes, I'm talking to you Ken Livingstone.\"\nKen Livingstone's way with a provocative soundbite was the making of him, propelling him to national prominence from the grey world of local government, but it has also got him into a lot of hot water over the years. Not for nothing is his autobiography called You Can't Say That.\nHe was suspended from office as London mayor for four weeks in 2006 for comparing a Jewish journalist to a concentration camp guard - a comment he continues to be unrepentant about, saying it was a \"fuss about nothing\". The suspension was overturned in court.\nHe remains popular in left wing circles as one of the few socialists to have achieved real power in the UK - but he had largely disappeared from the political scene, following his defeat in 2012 London mayoral contest.\nHe was enjoying semi-retirement when his old friend and ally Jeremy Corbyn was unexpectedly elected Labour leader last year. The two go back a long way.\nProfile: Ken Livingstone\nLabour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said: \"Ken Livingstone's comments are appalling and inexcusable. There must be no place for this in our party.\"\nAnd Labour MP Rachel Reeves, told BBC Newsnight: \"We know we've got a growing problem of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. But also part of the problem is the slow response from the leadership of the party. We do need to see much swifter and more decisive action.\"\nExplaining his stance, in a BBC News Channel interview, Mr Livingstone said Naz Shah was \"not anti-Semitic - she was completely over the top, what she said was rude\".\nHe added: \"I've heard a lot of people being critical of Israel, but if I was to denounce the South African government, you wouldn't say I was racist.\n\"And one of my worries is this confusion with anti-Semitism and criticising the Israeli government policy undermines the importance is tackling real anti-Semitism.\"\nBut Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Mr Livingstone's comments were \"abhorrent and beyond disgraceful\".\n\"He denies anti-Semitism in Labour when the evidence is there for all to see. He lacks any sense of reality and decency.

When SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood and Green Party leader Natalie Bennett got together at the end of one of the general election TV debates, leaving poor Ed Miliband flapping about on the sidelines.\nThat felt, to some, like a moment when things were changing for women in British politics.\nThe impressive performance of female politicians, such as Andrea Leadsom and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson in the EU referendum TV debates, felt like another.\nNow, with Mrs Leadsom and Theresa May battling it out for the Tory leadership we are on the verge of getting our second female prime minister, 26 years after Margaret Thatcher left Downing Street.\nOn the global stage, America could be about to get its first female president, in Hillary Clinton, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel continues to dominate European politics.\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster is the first woman to be First Minister in Northern Ireland and Ms Sturgeon continues to dominate things at Holyrood.\nLabour might even get a female leader for the first time in its history, if Angela Eagle decides to launch a challenge against Jeremy Corbyn.\nAnd if UKIP elects one of its high-profile spokeswomen, such as Diane James or Suzanne Evans, to replace Nigel Farage, and the Greens opt for another female leader we could be in a situation where the majority of Britain's political leaders are women, for the first time ever.\nBut have things really changed for women in British politics - or is it all just a historical accident?\nMany Conservative MPs love the idea that they are going to get a second female leader. What pleases them more than anything is that Labour, for all its hand-wringing about gender equality, and its women-only shortlists, has never managed to have one.\nThe Conservatives, in their practical, common-sense way have simply got on with it, they say.\nTim Montgomerie, Times journalist and former Tory insider, argued on the BBC's Newsnight that the fact that the party does not have a quota system, and women have to compete on equal terms with men for seats and influence, has created better, tougher politicians.\nCritics argue that party has arrived at an all-women shortlist to choose its next leader almost by accident, after the public schoolboy power games of the alpha males in the contest, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, ended in predictable disaster.\nWhich is a victory, of sorts, for female level-headedness and common sense.\nIn fact, there have been efforts going on behind the scenes for years in the Conservative Party, to mentor talented women and get them into winnable seats, through organisations like Conservative Women and Women2Win.\nDavid Cameron - who has taken his share of stick for having a \"problem\" with putting women in top cabinet jobs - has overseen a huge increase in female Tory MPs, from an admittedly low base.\nTen years ago there were just 17 female Tory MPs, now there are 68.\nMargaret Thatcher, who made history in 1979 by becoming Britain's first female prime minister, liked to surround herself with powerful, charismatic men.\nSome have called it the Queen Bee syndrome - the tendency of women in positions of authority to be more critical of subordinates who are also women.\nShe was once asked why she did not have more women in her cabinet. Because they are all so useless, she is reported to have said.\nBut there is no doubt that a generation of Conservative women, from cabinet members right down to members of the tiniest parish council, have looked to Thatcher as a role model.\nMore importantly, the party itself, once the very bastion of male privilege and entitlement, is entirely comfortable with the idea of a woman at the helm.\nImagine the endless, tedious questions about whether the party and the country was \"ready\" for a female leader, that would have attended the run-off between Leadsom and May, had Thatcher not been there first.\nShe went through all of that in her leadership contest in 1975, so they don't have to.\nLeft-wing critics may claim she did little to advance the cause of gender equality in British society during her 11 years in power but Thatcher did break down barriers for women in politics, whether she had intended to or not.\nIt is a profound source of embarrassment to Labour that they have never had a female leader.\nHarriet Harman and Margaret Beckett have both kept the seat warm between permanent male leaders, but there has never been a Labour Thatcher.\nThe macho culture of the old, industrial trade unions has been blamed by some for a lingering, subliminal sexism at the top of the party.\nOthers say the rise of \"identity politics\" - treating women as a special interest group rather than as individuals - has had the opposite effect to the one intended. Listening to Old Labour figures muttering about the \"sisterhood\" would lend weight to that argument.\nMiranda Green, a former senior Lib Dem aide, told the BBC's Daily Politics that Labour women tended to dismiss Conservative women such as Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom because they \"don't fit their idea of a feminist,\" when they should be celebrating them.\nBut, she added, Labour has at least put the structures in place to get more women into positions where they can challenge for ultimate power.\nTony Blair's controversial adoption of all-women shortlists, resulted in the biggest single influx of women MPs into Parliament in its history, permanently changing the character of the place.\nAnd Labour can, at least, console itself, that Ms Green's party, the Liberal Democrats, probably have the worst record of female representation in Parliament of any of the major parties.\nIt is easy to see the recent rise of women in British politics as a watershed moment - but we should not get ahead of ourselves.\nWomen are still massively under-represented in politics, and the barriers preventing them from reaching the top, in public life and business as much as in politics, are arguably just as high as they have ever been. They are just in a different place.\nStrong women are labelled shrill and pushy. The media focuses on their personal grooming and fashion sense in a way that would never happen to their male counterparts.\nAnd despite all the warm words from male leaders the formal, and informal, party structures can still militate against women getting to the top.\nBut none of that need worry Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom, who have made it through the obstacle course - and can now dream of walking through the doors of Number 10 in early September on their own terms.", "summary": "With Britain set to get its second woman prime minister, has the boys' club that has dominated British politics for centuries finally had its day?", "id": "36745873", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

There can be just as many in urban areas as in rural areas.\nLaunched in April 2015, the project asked participating vets to examine dogs in their practice for each week and complete a questionnaire relating to the clinical history of each dog. The species, life-cycle stage, sex and location of origin and whether it was carrying any pathogens were recorded.\nProf Richard Wall, who led the Big Tick Project team at the University of Bristol, said: \"The work that we have carried out shows that ticks are extremely widely dispersed. The records that we have got appear to show that we have had an increase in tick numbers right across the country.\n\"What we are primarily concerned about is the diseases that ticks carry. In the UK, we have relatively low rates of the prevalence of these pathogens at the moment and, in contrast, in continental Europe they have much higher rates of disease. As there seems to be a rise in tick numbers, we need to be concerned and be aware of the potential for increasing problems.\"\nProf Wall said pet owners should be aware of the risk in woodland or areas of long grass, but urban areas were also affected.\nReacting to the new data, conservationist Chris Packham said the \"good solid hard data\" which was  a \"tremendously significant project\" had revealed \"some very shocking and surprising things about the distribution, the population and potential that ticks have to give diseases to our pets and ourselves\".\nIt was surprising ticks were not just found in isolated parts of the UK, but all over the UK, he said.\nTicks don't jump or fly, they climb on to clothes if a person brushes against something that the tick is holding on to. Typically they can be found in woods, urban parks, heathland and fields. They can also be found in gardens.\nLyme disease is transmitted by the bite of a tick infected with Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria.\nThe tick acts as a vector. In the same way that a mosquito transmits malaria when it sucks blood from a person, the tick does the same to an animal or a person.\nAccording to Public Health England, it's estimated that there are 2,000 to 3,000 new confirmed cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, although not all cases are confirmed by laboratory testing. About 15% of cases are in people who have returned from abroad.\nOne initial symptom can be a red circular rash around the bite - called a \"bullseye\" rash. But this isn't always present and so can't be relied upon as a warning signal. Victims can develop flu-like symptoms along with muscle and joint pain.\nLyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. But if left untreated it can seriously damage a person's health, including affecting the nervous system, causing meningitis or heart failure.\nThe threat of Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) in the UK is still thought to be small compared with other countries - some 3% of ticks carry the bacteria.\nHowever, given the results of this study showing the high numbers of ticks across the country and with the serious potential consequences of Lyme disease, scientists are urging people to be aware of the risks and do their best to avoid being bitten.\nThe Big Tick Project has launched an online tool that people can access to find out where ticks are most prevalent.\nSarah Bignell was a very fit and active vet before she went on a walking holiday in Aberfeldy in Scotland in 2011. \"There was a small note in the cabin saying this was a Lyme disease hotspot but I didn't think anything of it. I had no idea,\" she says.\nSix weeks later, she started suffering pain in her bones, joints and nerves. Doctors put her symptoms down to other conditions, including multiple sclerosis or a brain tumour. However, Sarah's background meant that she knew to push for a Lyme disease test. She had been bitten by a tick - and she had been completely unaware of it. She also had no \"bullseye rash\".\nIt became agony \"virtually overnight\" for Sarah to deal with sound or light. She couldn't swallow, and when she could, it was agony. She had developed encephalitis. \"I spent eight-and-a-half months locked in a room,\" she explains. She needed constant care and could no longer look after her dog and cat.\nOver the next four-and-a-half years, Sarah had many close calls. \"I was in danger of dying. I am very lucky,\" she says.\n\"The pain used to be so severe and my quality of life so awful, at that point I was living hour to hour. If I had been well enough I would have ended up in Switzerland and I wouldn't be here now - I am a vet and I am used to ending suffering.\"\nWith extremely strong treatment, Sarah says she now only has one or two really bad days a month. \"I still get bouts of extreme fatigue. Days when I think - having a shower or putting the washing out - which one should I do today? Again I am lucky, there are loads of people not having the same treatment.\"\nSo what does she think should be done about Lyme disease? It's not particularly about investment or research, Sarah says. \"It is a very cunning and specialised bacteria. It is so complicated and mimics so many other diseases and each effect needs individual treatment. It's about being aware and not getting bitten,\" she explains.\n\"I'm not saying avoid the outdoors. The first thing I did again when I could get myself up on sticks was to go to the woods with my dog Matty. I walk him every day but I wear wellies even in the sunshine. I also wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts if I'm walking in long grass. Always light-coloured so the ticks show up. I live in Kent and one day this year when I got back to the car I found five ticks.\"\nSarah is working on her fitness and says she hopes to go back to part-time work as a vet next year.\nFollow Claire on Twitter.", "summary": "Almost a third of dogs checked at random across the UK were found to be carrying a tick, researchers say.", "id": "37252925", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-45111895?ocid=socialflow_twitter\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-45111895\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-45111895?ocid=socialflow_facebook\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe study, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, looked at 1,000 ticks from 100 sites across the UK.\nThe researchers found that the highest number of ticks was in the south-west of England, with the highest concentration in the New Forest.\nThe study also found that the highest number of ticks was in the south-west of England, with the highest concentration in the New Forest.\nThe study", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\"I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Big Tick Project is a citizen science project that aims to map the distribution of ticks in the UK.\nThe project is run by the Royal Veterinary College and the University of Bristol.\nThe project is funded by the Wellcome Trust.\nThe project is supported by the British Tick Association.\nThe project is supported by the British Ecological Society.\nThe project is supported by the British Ecological Society, the British Tick Association", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe UK is a hotspot for Lyme disease.\nThe UK is a hotspot for Lyme disease.

And your contribution to that is something that if you were doing it on your own, you'd maybe never have got round to. So you're covered.\"\nThere is a duty on employers to offer their staff a workplace pension through auto-enrolment.\nAnd by requiring them to opt out the scheme aims to \"nudge\" people into signing up for a pension.\nMo Clark, whose company runs Lebowskis and eight other pubs and restaurants, said all of the people they employed had signed up for the scheme.\n\"We put in place the process and procedure for auto-enrolment,\" he said.\n\"It's all about opting out if they so choose, and our opinion was that we would have some people opting out.\n\"Because of the nature of the licensed trade and hospitality, staff come and go. But we've been pleasantly surprised. It's been 100% take up. So zero opt-outs.\"\nThe so-called nudge at the heart of this pension scheme, seems to have encouraged more people to opt in.\nAnd by the end of this year those who are part of the scheme will get another \"nudge\" - to save more through higher pension contributions.\nBut that is a concern for Colin Borland of the Federation of Small businesses.\nHe said: \"The employer minimum contribution begins at 1%, but it rises steadily over the next couple of years till it gets to 3%, with 5% for the employee - making 8% of salary in total.\n\"That money has to be found from somewhere. And if you have a dozen staff or so, then its significant.\n\"But I think the impact goes beyond simple cost. When we asked them, three in four of our businesses said auto-enrolment put an awful lot of pressure - in fact too much pressure - on businesses like theirs. \"\nFive years after it was set up, this scheme is now being applied to the UK's smallest firms and by the time it is complete most workers in Scotland will have a workplace pension. But not everyone in the workforce is covered.\nJamie Jenkins, head of pensions strategy at Standard Life, said: \"At the moment self-employed people are not included.\n\"Across the UK there are almost five million people who are self-employed - and that includes people in the \"gig\" economy. They're not covered by auto-enrolment.\n\"We also have people on lower earnings, people who're under the age of 22, and people who perhaps have multiple jobs. So there are some quite large populations who we still need to consider bringing in to that auto-enrolment scope.\"\nUK Minister for Pensions Richard Harrington said: \"For most of us, if we want to continue to do the things we enjoy in retirement, a workplace or personal pension is something we'll need.\n\"That's why I am particularly pleased to see 400,000 people in Scotland saving for their retirement thanks to automatic enrolment.\n\"When it comes to saving my advice is start off small and build it up - even if you can only afford to put a bit in at first it can all add up over time.\n\"This year many more small employers will see their workplace pensions duties start and my message to them is clear: don't be daunted, there is help and support out there.\"\nUntil now, it's been hard to persuade people to save for their retirement. It's so easy to put off.\nWe all know why. The paperwork's boring and complex. We tend to wait decades to feel the benefit. Will we live that long? Would we prefer a holiday this summer instead? Or a new sofa now? Choices, choices. All tend to put us off.\nBut 441,000 Scots now have a new workplace pension, thanks to auto-enrolment. So it's worth looking at how it's overcome our natural inertia so effectively.\nIt seems it's down to \"nudge\" theory, a new government tactic, inspired by \"behavioural economics\".\nA nudge is small and simple. That's its beauty. Few of us mind being nudged into doing \"the right thing\".\nSo when it comes to retirement, workers are simply nudged into joining a workplace pension scheme. They have one month to opt out. If they don't, they're signed up.\nThere's freedom to leave, but who would choose to? It's all in a good cause. And after a while, they're nudged to increase the amount they save for their retirement. It's simple and relatively painless.\nNudge theory is now used in a lots of different settings. Bags of fruit next to the checkouts nudge us to buy healthy snacks.\nSome fast food outlets write the buyer's name on the bag - which can nudge us not to drop litter on the way home.

BBC Wales' correspondents have some suggestions.\nAGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT - Steffan Messenger\nFor Wales' farmers, much will depend on getting the right trade deal.\nWith 90% of Welsh agricultural produce currently exported to the EU, farming leaders want unfettered access to the major market on their doorstep.\nTalk of new agreements with New Zealand, the US and elsewhere is prompting talk of foreign meat flooding supermarket shelves and fears that current high production standards could be undermined.\nAfter decades of abiding by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the chance to rewrite the rule book is an exciting prospect for many.\nBut big questions remain about whether it is the Welsh Government or Westminster who will take charge.\nThere are questions too about whether they will continue to subsidise farmers.\nFor many in Wales, the payments they receive from Brussels are the difference between making a profit or loss, accounting for 81% of Welsh farms' income in 2014-15.\nWhen it comes to the environment, virtually all the laws which protect wildlife and water quality, and which tackle air pollution and climate change, have their roots in Brussels.\nAny plans to change environmental protections will be watched closely by those on both sides of the Brexit divide.\nBUSINESS AND ECONOMICS - Brian Meechan and Sarah Dickins\nWales has had significant amounts of EU cash to grow its economy, generate jobs and improve living standards.\n36,970 jobs created\n18,645 enterprises assisted\n72,700 helped into work\n234,335 qualifications gained\nIt has been spent on a wide range of initiatives in west Wales and the valleys, including road and port improvements and schemes to strengthen communities and support childcare.\nThere is also a separate programme to develop rural areas.\nMany Welsh Government projects to improve people's skills have also been part-funded by the EU. They include Jobs Growth Wales, ReAct, Go Wales, and an apprenticeship programme.\nWhether similar schemes will continue after Brexit will depend on UK and Welsh government policies in the future.\nThere is also the question of whether EU nationals working here will be allowed to stay, whether others will be allowed into the UK after Brexit, and if not, how skills will be developed within the UK labour pool to replace them.\nBecause of the single market, Wales has been an attractive place for overseas companies to make products to sell across Europe, for example Japanese firms making TVs and computers.\nIf the UK is no longer part of the single market, new agreements on tariffs and regulations will be needed, which may influence business decisions on investment.\nThere are also firms whose ownership crosses several EU states, such as Airbus, which manufactures plane wings in Flintshire and transports them to Toulouse in France for assembly.\nAirbus is concerned about its ability to put staff on a plane in the UK and have them working in Toulouse the next day.\nThe UK government has indicated it will try to negotiate special arrangements for key sectors.\nOn tariffs, Theresa May has already said she will not accept the customs union in its current form when the UK leaves as it limits trade deals with non-EU countries.\nBusinesses will want to know what this means for trade.\nThe EU is currently our biggest market - 67% of Welsh exports go to the European Union.  Some Welsh firms are already looking at opening offices in the EU.\nHowever there are also opportunities for new trade deals with the likes of the US, China and India.\nWelsh productivity is about 30% lower than the rest of the UK's, which itself lags behind competitors including France and Germany.\nMore investment in roads and rail might make the country more productive. The South Wales Metro is part-funded by the EU and First Minister Carwyn Jones has said without that money, it could take longer to deliver the project.\nEDUCATION - Colette Hume\nInternational students are big business for Welsh universities and there are concerns about the impact of leaving the EU on the number choosing to study in Wales.\nAccording to the universities admission service Ucas the number of EU applicants choosing to study in the UK decreased by 7% this year.\nUniversities say it is still to soon to fully understand the implications of leaving the EU in terms of research and development.\nBut with so many projects supported by EU cash it seems improbable that institutions will not be affected - then of course there is the issue of brain drain.\nWill internationally renowned academics based in Wales choose to take their skills elsewhere when EU funding runs out?\nHEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE  - Owain Clarke\nOfficial data suggests about 6% of doctors working in Wales qualified in another EU country and there are recruitment problems in certain parts of Wales and in some specialist areas.\nThe UK government would need to clarify its intentions on the ability of EU nationals to work in the health and care sectors.\nThere will be questions too about access to healthcare for EU citizens living here, and for Welsh people living in EU countries, and what the arrangements will be for tourists who currently use the European Health Insurance Card to get treatment when on holiday.\nLike in the rest of the UK, Welsh NHS workers will be keeping an eye on what happens to the working time directive because of the possible impact on their rotas, pay and contracts.\nIn addition there will be pros and cons to any changes in the regulation of medicines and clinical trials.\nCULTURE - Huw Thomas\nThe former chairman of Welsh National Opera and prominent Remain campaigner, Geraint Talfan Davies, has suggested that at least \u00a32.3m in European funding was due to be spent on Welsh cultural projects by 2020.\nBut Mr Davies, also a former controller of BBC Wales and chairman of the Arts Council, said it was harder to quantify other benefits such as the money made available to international consortia, and initiatives such as the EU Capital of Culture.\nHe argues that the focus during Brexit negotiations should be on \"retaining UK participation in the EU's cultural programmes, for artistic as much as financial reasons\".\nAnecdotally, some parts of the creative industries are already benefiting from a Brexit boost. I'm told the weaker pound has helped exports, and encouraged deals with foreign buyers, in areas such as film and animation.\nBut unrestricted access to existing trading partners in the European Union, and minimal travel restrictions on touring companies and individual performers, are prominent items on the wish-list from Wales' cultural and creative community.", "summary": "Prime Minister Theresa May has officially notified the European Union on Wednesday that the UK is leaving.", "id": "39327118", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe UK is leaving the EU.\nThe UK is leaving the EU.

Comey made it clear that he was working hard on the investigation and had no plans to drop the matter or go easy on the president.\nComey also spoke with lawmakers about the bureau's investigation into the Russians, and about its investigation into the emails of Hillary Clinton. On 3 May he told members of Congress that he felt he'd approached both investigations in an impartial manner.\nThis did not sit well with the president, who was hoping that the investigation into his past ties with Russia would be dropped. Trump had expected Comey to make a public statement saying there was no investigation of him. He'd made sure Comey knew he was hoping for that statement, but Comey had refused to do it. That had gnawed away at Trump over recent weeks.\nTrump became even more wary when Comey testified before Congress on 3 May. The president, as White House officials explained later, was inclined to remove him from his post.\nIn a termination letter written to the FBI director, the president laid out his complaint and explained the rationale for his firing: \"While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgement of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.\"\nFive days earlier - the day after Comey spoke with members of Congress - the president left on a trip to New York and then headed to New Jersey. For three days - from Thursday night until Sunday - the president was not seen by the public. He was staying at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, not far from New York City.\nWhile the president was spending time at his club, other members of the press pool and I - a small group of reporters who are responsible for tracking the president's activities on a daily basis - were waiting around in a hotel in nearby Branchburg. We weren't allowed to visit the resort. Instead White House officials would occasionally stop by the hotel and tell us that the president was having meetings - but wouldn't tell us with whom or what about.\nPresidents - like everybody else - like to have down time and relax. They're also free to work wherever they want. But it was unusual for a president to disappear from the public for this long and without a more detailed explanation from his aides about his activities. As it turned out, he was thinking about the FBI director - and the possibility of his ouster.\nOn Sunday evening Trump rode in a motorcade through New Jersey, driving past red barns and horse pastures, but he was in a dark vehicle and couldn't be seen. Then he got on Air Force One to fly from New Jersey to Washington. That's when members of the press saw him for the first time since Thursday.\nHe and his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner were seated in a cabin in the front of the aeroplane. KT McFarland, the deputy national security adviser, was on the flight. Stephen Miller, wearing a navy jacket and a white shirt with no tie, paced around the cabin.\nI didn't see HR McMaster, the national security adviser, or Stephen Bannon, the chief White House strategist. I was surprised because on most of the trips I'd gone on with the president, I'd seen Bannon on the aeroplane.\nThat evening I was sitting in the back of the aeroplane with the other reporters, and someone told me that Trump waved at us. During the short flight, the people in the front of the cabin were laughing and joking around.\nThen the aeroplane landed - and something seemed wrong. Kushner and his family came downstairs and headed towards a dark sedan, but the president didn't.\nMembers of the travelling press pool wait until the president gets off the plane and gets on his helicopter, Marine Force One, before they leave the tarmac - and so I stood there.\nIt was cold and blustery, and I spent a long time looking at the windows of the aeroplane and trying to figure out what was going on. We were there for so long that even the Secret Service agents started to look bored. One of them yawned.\nI asked White House aides about the delay, and they told me the president was in a meeting. \"He didn't want to break it off,\" one of the aides told me later.\nWhile we waited on the tarmac, an aide carried two or three golf clubs down the stairs, holding them close to his side so they'd be less visible. (Still they clanked together as he walked down the stairs - it's hard to hide golf clubs.)\nAt one point Kushner went back up the stairs of the plane. Every family has a mediator, someone who calms everyone else down, and he seems to play that role. After a while he came down the stairs again.\n\"Everything's OK,\" Kushner told me, talking about the president and his reasons for staying the plane. \"He was just working on something.\"\nFinally - after 45 minutes - Trump came out. He wasn't wearing a tie, and his hair looked messy. He gripped the handrail and walked down the stairs and headed for Marine Force One and back to the White House.\nI'm still not sure whom the president was meeting with on the plane or why the meeting was so important that it couldn't be interrupted when the plane landed. McFarland wasn't in the meeting - at least I don't think she was. I could see her walking past the windows of the plane. White House officials haven't provided me with more of an explanation for what was happening on the plane.\nOne thing seemed clear, though: the president was preparing for the important announcement about the FBI director in a safe, cloistered environment, an atmosphere in which he was unlikely to be challenged in a dramatic way.\nThat changed, of course, on Tuesday when Comey was sacked, and people outside the president's circle found out about the president's plans. The relaxed, contemplative world that he'd created had come to an end.\nUnlike previous presidents, he does not seem to have an established system either for his decision-making or for the rollout of major announcements. Trump may have thought long and hard about the termination of Comey, but analysts said that he didn't lay the groundwork for what would happen next.\n\"You'd think if you're going to fire someone, you'd have a successor lined up,\" said David Greenberg, the author of Nixon's Shadow: The History of an Image.\nRight now the search is on for a new FBI director: stay tuned.", "summary": "How US President Donald Trump spent his time before the firing of the FBI director - quietly and away from the public - sheds light on his decision-making.", "id": "39875139", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

Spaniard Rafael Nadal is 31, Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland is 32, Serbia's Novak Djokovic is 30 and Swiss Roger Federer 35.\nBut Murray said that despite players continuing to compete at the highest level into their 30s he accepts that he may not have long left at the top.\n\"My coach, Ivan Lendl, was still competitive at the top until he was about 32 but, generally, over the past 20 to 30 years, normally by early 30s is when players have struggled to stay at the top.\n\"I know some of the players have been doing really well until their mid-30s recently, but that might not be the case with me. Maybe the next couple of years are the last few where I have a chance to compete for the majors and the biggest tournaments.\n\"Most of the players are travelling with physios now, spending a lot more time working in the gym to protect their bodies from the kind of pounding you give it on the court as well. I think some of that explains it.\n\"I don't know how long I'm going to be playing for any more. I want to make the most of every tournament I compete in. If I'm going to be away from my family, I'm not going to do that and not do my best, be totally professional and take every tournament as seriously as I can.\n\"I'll continue to play and so long as my body is fine. I would like to hope that I would continue to do that whilst I'm still enjoying it.\n\"I enjoy being away from the court. I have a family now - I have more interests away from the court than I did in my early 20s or mid 20s - so obviously it will be sad to stop. But I think I'll be all right.\"\nWimbledon, which Murray won in 2013 and 2016, begins on 3 July and the defending champion says expectations will be high that he can repeat his previous successes.\n\"For me, it is obviously always going to be the biggest tournament during the year,\" said Murray, who begins his grass-court season at next week's Aegon Championships at Queen's.\n\"A lot of pressure comes with it as well. There's a lot of expectation during this period, so it can be a bit stressful - but I'm able to get away from that as well because I'm at home, I'm sleeping in my own bed and I have all my family around me.\n\"I'm older and more experienced in dealing with it. The pressure and stress that goes with it maybe doesn't affect me quite as much when I was younger.\nOn the possibility of equalling fellow Briton Perry's Wimbledon record of three wins, he added: \"It would be amazing, I never expected to win it once, never mind twice. It had been such a long time since any British man had won that.\n\"I'll give it my best shot for sure. I'll prepare as best I can and if I play well then I definitely have a chance of winning.\"\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\nSince becoming world number one in November last year he has struggled with injuries and for form. So has the pressure of being top of the rankings taken its toll?\n\"It hasn't for me,\" he said.\n\"I mean, I've been asked that question lots over the past few months. I didn't play particularly well from February through to the French Open, but at the French [where he was knocked out in the semi-finals by Wawrinka] I felt I played quite well.\n\"It [the world ranking] isn't something I think about when I'm on the court or when I'm preparing for matches.\n\"Obviously when you get asked about it, you spend a little bit of time thinking: 'Maybe, could it be because of that?' But I really don't think it has been the reason why I struggled for a few months - but everyone will have their own opinion on that.\n\"It's been a frustrating few months because I picked up a couple of injuries, including one to my elbow, and a couple of illnesses.\n\"I was still pretty nervous going into the French because I'd hardly won any matches for a while, but with each match that I got through, I started to build confidence, started to play a little bit better and was very close to reaching the final by the end.\n\"Form can turn around very quickly providing you're mentally in the right place and you're doing the right things and training. And I feel I'm in a good place now to go on a good run during the grass.\"\nAfter reaching the quarter-finals at the French Open, Murray paid tribute to the victims of the recent attacks in Manchester and London.\nWimbledon organisers are preparing for the biggest security operation in the Championships' 140-year history, and Murray admits safety is now a concern.\n\"I do think about it - when you're playing in front of huge crowds, or you're in walking around the grounds and there's huge, huge amounts of people.\n\"But we do also see the security that goes into sporting events now and it's been fine throughout my career -but it is something that is a concern from time to time.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray is already starting to think about what to do when he steps away from the court and advising young players, possibly in a sports management capacity, is something he is considering.\n\"I wish I'd enjoyed my career more when I was younger. I enjoy it a lot more now than I did when I was 19, 20, 21,\" added the three-time Grand Slam champion.\n\"I certainly wasn't prepared for the attention that came with becoming a professional athlete or a top tennis player.\n\"I didn't feel ready for that. I really struggled with the attention that came with that, and I think throughout my career I've made lots of mistakes - maybe some that could have been avoided.\n\"That's something I would like to pass on to young British athletes, how to avoid [mistakes] because so many athletes go through the same thing.\n\"It's about surrounding yourself with people who have been down that road before, people who can give you the best advice possible.\"", "summary": "World number one Andy Murray says he may only have \"a couple of years\" left at the top of tennis but insists he will \"make the most of every tournament\".", "id": "40295412", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nMurray is already starting to think about what to do when he steps away from the court and advising young players, possibly in a sports management capacity, is something he is considering. \"I wish I'd enjoyed my career more when I was younger.

The rest could be covered by loans.\nMr Andrews said at the time: \"We are having to raise fees because of the policies of the UK government, which have a distorting impact on our budgets and on the competitive position of Welsh higher education institutions.\"\nThe policy drew concerns from opposition politicians that it would likely be unsustainable.\nFormer Conservative education spokeswoman Angela Burns said the subsidy was a \"increasingly uncertain financial commitment for the public purse\" - and later said the policy was seeing \"tens of millions of pounds of Welsh Government funding to universities outside of Wales\".\nWorries also came from the higher education sector about the amount of cash heading to English universities as a result and in 2013 Mr Andrews' successor as education minister Huw Lewis commissioned the Diamond review.\nFormer Welsh Government education advisor, Prof David Reynolds of Swansea University, said the policy had been \"brave\" and the degree of subsidy was \"unique around the planet\".\nHe said: \"I think they were trying to help the prospects of lower socio-economic status, more disadvantaged students going to university and I think it was an attempt to show the broader world that Wales was valuing higher education.\"\nHe believed there were hints \"that maybe the generous subsidy might not have had huge effects on the numbers coming through higher education.\n\"If resources were available... I think people would have been anxious to stay with what was a trademark, unusual impressive commitment to helping students into higher education and I think people would have stayed with it.\n\"If there are changes, Welsh Government will do it reluctantly... because they thought, and they were right to think it, that this was a fantastic thing to do to help students in Wales go to HE.\"\nPrior to the Welsh Assembly election last May there was a growing consensus among some of the parties that the tuition fee subsidy would be reformed.\nBoth the Welsh Conservatives and the Welsh Liberal Democrats - whose former leader Ms Williams is now in charge of implementing tuition fee policy - went into the election with similar commitments to scrap the fee grant and replace it with a system of support for living costs.\nPlaid Cymru also pledged to replace the current fee system, but with plans to pay off up to \u00a318,000 of debt for graduates who return to Wales. UKIP, for its part, said it would replace the tuition fee grant with loans for Welsh students choosing to study in England.\nLabour also did not say it would continue the current system - Julie James told the BBC before the election the party was not committed to the grant.\nShe said there may be \"nuanced changes\" depending on the outcome of the review by Prof Diamond.\nLabour won the most seats but not a majority at the election, meaning it and Ms Williams will likely need the support of another party to get any changes through.\nOpposition parties also could, in theory, block any new policy.\nPlaid education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said: \"If I'm persuaded it is a better way of doing it, I won't stand in the way of changing the emphasis towards supporting a maintenance grant system.\"\nHe said there was a \"huge irony in the fact that the Lib Dems initially said in Westminster that they wouldn't introduce tuition fees, they did so, and now potentially we have a Liberal Democrat cabinet secretary in Wales doing away with the financial support for those paying tuition fees\".\nHe indicated he would accept new proposals if it could be shown they met the criteria of closing the \"funding gap\" between Welsh and English higher education, being sustainable over the long term, are not dependent on changes made at Westminster, and have a focus on attracting high skilled people to Wales to boost the economy.\nPeter Black, a former Liberal Democrat AM, said there was a \"mild concern\" from a \"minority\" of Lib Dems over Ms Williams potentially implementing a policy which could see tuition fee grants taken away from students.\nBut he said the Welsh Lib Dems policy of replacing tuition fee grants with support for living costs had been backed by the party membership.\n\"If Kirsty is able to implement that policy I think she will have 100% support from the party in doing that,\" the Swansea councillor said.\n\"Clearly people are nervous because we need to sell that policy properly.\n\"It is not a concern about anybody breaking promises,\" he said, arguing that if Ms Williams is able to \"we are implementing our manifesto\".\nIt was not clear when Mr Black spoke what Prof Diamond's recommendation would be, but he said he would be happy to go on doorsteps in Welsh student areas \"and say to students the Welsh Lib Dems minister is going to giving you x amount in grant every year to help you through your studies, whereas if you were in England you wouldn't get a penny\".\nJenny Rathbone is a backbench Labour AM who serves Cardiff Central - a constituency with the highest proportion of students in the UK.\nShe said there should be more support for living costs for students from families on low incomes.\n\"Our concern ought to be everyone should be entitled to go to university if they have got the ability and the income of their family shouldn't be a barrier,\" she said.\n\"We have to be realistic about what we can do at the moment. I think the maintenance grant is much more important because the tuition fee is an investment in that persons future.\n\"The tuition fee is not something they have to pay until much later, until they are earning a reasonable salary.\"", "summary": "The findings of the long-awaited report into student finance in Wales have been published.", "id": "37441881", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "The Welsh Government has been subsidizing tuition fees for Welsh students at English universities.

Everything she needed for her 73-day trip had to be chosen and carried on her yacht. This practical fact led her to wider considerations.\nIt brought home to her the realisation that the globe we live on was no different from her trimaran. The earth carries everything with it necessary for life. And we are using up much of that everything, very fast.\nEllen MacArthur was awarded a damehood as soon as she arrived home, part of a long tradition of British circumnavigation. She is a self-possessed and thoughtful woman.\nThe ideas that had taken root sailing round the world were translated into an organisation launched in 2010 - the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It is devoted to what is called the \"circular economy\".\nThe concept has been developing for some time. In particular, the Swiss architect and economist Walter Stahel put forward the concept of a \"cradle to cradle\" economy in a paper he wrote for the European Union in 1976.\nIn contrast to the conventional economic system based on taking, making and disposing of things, he described a non-linear economy running in loops, reusing materials, and with big implications for job creation, competitiveness, resource savings and waste creation.\nMr Stahel went on to found the Product-Life Institute in Geneva in 1982, refining the idea of the circular economy and attempting to eliminate the idea of \"waste\" altogether.\nThere is no waste in nature, goes the argument... waste is food. This is a revolutionary (and frightening) way of thinking about our human all-consuming world.\nOther ideas have converged around this concept - a closed-loop system whereby factories send nothing to landfill and reuse their products at the end of their life.\nThe key proposal is that products should be leased by manufacturers, not sold to consumers. In this way, companies become service providers retaining overall ownership of the things they make. Tyre manufacturers selling travel kilometres, not tyres, for example.\nThere is also the concept of \"natural capitalism\", evolved by Paul Hawkins and Amory and Hunter Lovins, and set out in their book of the same name in 1999.\nThey argued that the world view of most corporations has not changed since the start of the industrial revolution. But 200 years ago natural resources were abundant, and it was the availability of labour that was the thing that limited production.\nIn the 21st century, things are different - labour is abundant, but it's natural capital that is running short: natural resources and our environmental support system.\nFor a long time, the proponents of natural capitalism and the circular economy were voices crying in a business wilderness.\nOne corporate leader who did take notice was the founder of one of the world's biggest carpet companies, Interface.\nThe late Ray Anderson had what he called an epiphany 20 years ago, when his company was already 21 years old.\nIt was then that he read an earlier book by Paul Hawken - The Ecology of Commerce. This argued that only industry leaders could reverse the destructive harm industry was doing to the planet.\nRay Anderson was stunned by this. In response, he turned it into a company cause, pledging to turn Interface into a sustainable company without any negative impact on the environment by 2020.\nSadly, he died in 2011 before that could be achieved, but the mission continues. And other businesses are waking up to this imperative.\nNow, back to Ellen MacArthur in her Foundation's headquarters in what is said to be Henry VIII's former gunpowder store in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. She is a persuasive woman.\nInspired by living alone on her yacht for more than two months, she found herself nagged by the question: how can our world continue to function with the economic model we've been living with for two centuries?\nBack on land, she asked questions of experts, commissioned weighty research from the consultants McKinsey, and eventually launched the Foundation around the idea of the circular economy.\nIt is a concept much larger than just recycling, she insists. It's about maintaining the value of everything we use for as long as possible. Inspired by the way there is no waste in nature, it looks for other uses for the by-products discarded during conventional production.\nAnd, as number-crunching by the brain boxes at McKinsey showed, there are huge economic advantages to industry if this is adopted - potentially hundreds of billions of pounds or euros or dollars a year.\nThe circular economy sounds high-minded but remote from everyday business life. But that is beginning to change. It is now the sort of thing business leaders talk about at the World Economic Forum at Davos, which took place this week.\nThe significant thing about the foundation is the way Ellen MacArthur has persuaded a clutch of big companies to join her campaign, including Cisco, BT, Renault and Philips.\nAnother very prominent supporter of the circular economy is Unilever, with a vast global reach for its household goods. Unilever's Dutch chief executive, Paul Polman, says the company has long been concerned about industry's reliance on diminishing supplies of raw materials.\n\"We need a way of decoupling our growth from environmental impact,\" is how he put it to me. That's why Unilever is backing Ellen MacArthur, and finding ways of putting the circular economy principles to work, factory by factory, product by product.\nFor the companies lining up behind the foundation, it is - I think - more than just public relations.\nThey have done the maths. They see the consequences of a growing global consumer society, and they realise that tackling looming raw material shortages (as well as energy and water) requires some energetic rethinking of the way things have been done in business up to now.\nBut change on this scale is hard to do, especially when big companies have investors breathing down their necks about the quarterly results. Investor attitudes will have to change, too.\nEllen MacArthur and Paul Polman talk to Peter Day about the circular economy in the radio programme Global Business on the BBC World Service.

It changed the rules in January to make the head \"a no-go area\", warning that any player making above-the-shoulder contact risks a red card.\nIt was undoubtedly \"reckless\" rather than \"accidental\" and, considering the force and Watson's vulnerability, the red card was fully warranted.\nI don't think it was malicious, Williams does not seem the sort of player to attempt to hurt another.\nBut the laws don't allow any wriggle room on those grounds.\nWorld Rugby is trying to get the game to be as clean as possible and is asking the players to make smarter decisions rather than just throwing themselves into a collision in an uncontrolled way.\nGarces took his time, consulted his assistants and reached the correct decision. It was undoubtedly a huge factor in the result.\nAt the top level, there have been a few examples of teams triumphing when down a man. Racing 92 beat Toulon in the 2016 Top 14 final after having Maxime Machenaud sent off in the first half. England did the same against Argentina in November after Elliot Daly had been shown red.\nBut it put the hosts at a huge disadvantage, with another 65 minutes to play.\nWould the Lions have won against a full-strength All Blacks side? It's impossible to say, a complete hypothetical.\nAnd the Lions players won't care a jot.\nThat is because if you ask any player in world rugby what sort of victory they would take over the All Blacks, especially in New Zealand, they will take it any way they can get it.\nThe two teams' reaction to the All Blacks going down to 14 men was markedly different.\nNew Zealand reacted quicker and more clearly to a curveball that neither Lions coach Warren Gatland nor All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen could have prepared for.\nThey threw down the gauntlet in the pack and backed themselves to contain the Lions, with Jerome Kaino withdrawn and only seven forwards on the pitch.\nIn the backs, they introduced Ngani Laumape, who was direct, forceful and recreated some of that go-forward that went off with Williams.\nBack up to a full complement in the backline, they could deny the Lions the space the tourists wanted out wide as well.\nWhat will frustrate Gatland is that the Lions could not get any control of the game after the red card.\nThere were too many errors and too much indiscipline, with the Lions leaking costly penalties under little pressure.\nYou can understand a player giving away a penalty because they think doing so is the lesser of two evils and not infringing might allow the other team to score a try.\nBut these were needless penalties to give the All Blacks a hold of the scoreboard.\nIt was level when Williams was sent off after 25 minutes, but after an hour the All Blacks had ground out a 18-9 lead.\nThe most high-profile offender during this period was prop Mako Vunipola.\nHe gave away a penalty with an clumsy charge into Beauden Barrett and, just a few minutes later, earned a yellow card for an unnecessary clear-out on the prone Kiwi fly-half.\nAdd in his occasional wobbles at scrum time against Owen Franks and it won't be a performance he looks back on with any pride.\nGiven the England man's skills in the loose, it would go against the way that the Lions want to play to drop Vunipola. But people have been left out for less in other teams.\nHe won't be feeling that certain of a third Test start.\nThe big talking point before kick-off was Gatland's selection of Owen Farrell at 12 to provide a second playmaking option alongside Johnny Sexton at fly-half.\nUltimately, on balance, that selection was justified.\nFarrell and Sexton do not knock people back and the All Blacks made yardage down that 10-12 channel.\nBut that vulnerability is the price you pay for having the two best readers of the game on the pitch at the same time and sharpening the tourists' attacking edge.\nTheir runaround play - combined with quick hands from Elliot Daly and Liam Williams - sprung Anthony Watson down the right wing before they cannily used the space created on the opposite side to put Taulupe Faletau in.\nFor Conor Murray's score, it was a deft pop from Sexton to put Jamie George into space and a crafty clear-out of TJ Perenara from Farrell to open the way to the line for the scrum-half.\nWould those chances have been created and then taken without them both on the pitch? It's unlikely.\nThe Lions have an explosive back three, and Sexton and Farrell are the best equipped to ensure them a diet of fast, good ball.\nThe first place that the Lions coaching staff wanted to see improvement on last weekend's defeat was up front in the close quarters.\nIn the first Test, the tourists were knocked back too often.\nThis time the gain line was not continually breached by the All Blacks one-out runners. There were bigger hits by the Lions today, which made the breakdown more competitive.\nDefence coach Andy Farrell called on his players to \"man up\" and no-one responded better to that than Sean O'Brien.\nThe flanker carried with purpose, racking up a team-high nine, and tackled offensively, backed up by a more physical display by Sam Warburton and Faletau alongside him in the back row.\nMaro Itoje was right there alongside them.\nHe dropped the ball on his first carry and gave away a couple of sloppy penalties, but added dynamism, making a huge contribution around the pitch.\nAdd in the fact that he took over the line-out calling duties from the dropped George Kruis and oversaw an 80% return from that set-piece on the Lions' throw, and it was a near man-of-the-match performance.\nNow the anticipation grows to see what next weekend will bring.", "summary": "And so, just like in 1993 when the Lions visited New Zealand, the series is heading for a decider at Eden Park.", "id": "40469844", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "The Lions have a chance to win the series, but they need to win the next two Tests.\nThe All Blacks have a chance to win the series, but they need to win the next two Tests.\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but they need to win the next two Tests.\nThe All Blacks have a chance to win the series, but they need to win the next two Tests.\nThe Lions have a chance", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Lions' back row was the best in the world.\nThe All Blacks' back row was the best in the world.\nThe Lions' back row was the best in the world.\nThe All Blacks' back row was the best in the world.\nThe Lions' back row was the best in the world.\nThe All Blacks' back row was the best in the world.\nThe Lions' back row was the best in the world", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "the Lions' 12-9 defeat to the All Blacks.\nThe Lions' 12-9 defeat to the All Blacks.\nThe Lions' 12-9 defeat to the All Blacks.\nThe Lions' 12-9 defeat to the All Blacks.\nThe Lions' 12-9 defeat to the All Blacks.\nThe Lions' 12-9 defeat to the All Blacks", "decode_al_05_be_15_lay_2": "\nThe Lions' 10-12 record in the first Test was a disaster.\nThe Lions' 12-12 record was a disaster.\nThe Lions' 12-12 record was a disaster.\nThe Lions' 12-12 record was a disaster.\nThe Lions' 12-12 record was a disaster.\nThe Lions' 12-12", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "The Lions have a chance to win the series, but the All Blacks are the best team in the world.\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but the All Blacks are the best team in the world.\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but the All Blacks are the best team in the world.\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but the All Blacks are the best team in the world.\n", "decode_al_1_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe Lions' defence was better than the All Blacks' attack.\nThe Lions' attack was better than the All Blacks' defence.\nThe Lions' defence was better than the All Blacks' attack.\nThe Lions' attack was better than the All Blacks' defence.\nThe Lions' defence was better than the All Blacks' attack.\nThe Lions' attack was better than the All Blacks' defence.\nThe Lions", "decode_al_1_be_12_lay_2": "the Lions' backs were not as good as the All Blacks' backs, but they were not as bad as the Lions' forwards.\nThe Lions' backs were not as good as the All Blacks' backs, but they were not as bad as the Lions' forwards.\nThe Lions' backs were not as good as the All Blacks' backs, but they were not as bad as the Lions' forwards", "decode_al_15_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but they will have to do it without the services of the injured Kruis and the suspended Itoje.\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but they will have to do it without the services of the injured Kruis and the suspended Itoje.\nThe Lions have a chance to win the series, but they will have to do it without the services of the injured Kruis and the susp", "decode_al_15_be_1_lay_2": "the Lions' back three was not as effective as the All Blacks' back three.\nThe Lions' back three was not as effective as the All Blacks' back three.\nThe Lions' back three was not as effective as the All Blacks' back three.\nThe Lions' back three was not as effective as the All Blacks' back three.\nThe Lions' back three was not as effective as the All Blacks' back three.\n", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_3": "\nThe Lions have a lot of work to do to get back into this series.\nThe All Blacks have a lot of work to do to get back into this series.\nThe Lions have a lot of work to do to get back into this series.

I'm so proud of all the families, legal team and you (the media).\n\"I cannot put into words how we feel... we've been crying.\n\"An inquest gives us the opportunity to hear from people you wouldn't normally hear from and it can lead to all sorts of things... the truth... the truth is fundamental.\"\nPub bombers 'will not be jailed'\nWhat is the IRA?\nOne of the six wrongly convicted men, Paddy Hill, said outside the court: \"They (police) don't want [the inquests] because there's too many skeletons in the cupboard.\n\"They had advanced warning and they took no notice.  I don't think Birmingham police could spell truth - they're rotten.\n\"I'm very sceptical about getting the truth.\"\nFollowing the release of the Birmingham Six, a reinvestigation was opened, led by the then Chief Constable for the West Midlands, Ron Hadfield, and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Barbara Mills.\nA team of 40 officers generated 5,000 documents, statements and reports. In 1994, they concluded there was insufficient evidence for proceedings against any person, and the inquiries had been carried out were to the satisfaction of the DPP.\nMs Mills placed a 75-year embargo on files relating to a Devon and Cornwall Police inquiry into the West Midlands Police investigation.\nThe coroner went through the names of the 21 people who lost their lives and the events of the night and the evidence she heard over the past few months.\nShe said she had no doubt that ascertaining the truth about what happened on the night of 21 November would be difficult but that there was evidence that needed to be heard.\nBut she said with a note of caution, families and survivors may not get the answers that they want as the inquest could be inconclusive.\nWhat happens next is pre-inquest hearings where we'll hear from West Midlands Police, the Police Federation, fire and ambulance and the government - they will have to go through its archive - and we'll hear from MI5 and the Foreign Office.\nBut it won't be until next year when we have a full hearing.\nThe campaign to resume inquests has escalated in recent years as the victims' families fought for justice.\nMaxine Hambleton's brother Brian said he was \"overwhelmed\" at hearing the result and that his emotions \"just took over\".\n\"I just thought about my sister, the atrocity... and West Midlands Police are battling so hard to prevent the truth from coming out. But luckily, coroner Louise Hunt is allowing the truth to come out now.\n\"The truth will prevail. I believe that and that's what keeps me going.\"\nDespite the force's opposition to the families' legal bid, West Midlands Police Chief Constable Dave Thompson said he welcomed the coroner's decision.\n\"West Midlands Police not only failed to catch those responsible but caused a miscarriage of justice,\" he said.\n\"I have said, and reiterate again, it is the most serious failing in this force's history.\n\"I understand families of those who lost their lives are frustrated, disappointed and angry.\n\"West Midlands Police will support this inquiry as we have done through the recent hearings by the coroner which determined whether the inquest should reopen.

bygones be bygones and love the teachers' unions.\nWhat kind of March hare madness is this?\nThe two biggest teachers' unions, the NUT and NASUWT, are gathering for their Easter conferences. And it has been an article of faith to ritually condemn Ofsted and all its works.\nThe education watchdog for England has been the relentless target of teachers' anger, accused of unfair and summary judgements and demoralising the profession.\nConferences have called for the resignation of Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw. And this year's NUT conference will have barely started when it will hear the first call for the abolition of Ofsted.\nBut maybe this bank holiday the union conferences should think again. Because next year, they might wish they still had Sir Michael in office as the nation's unyielding head teacher.\nWhy would they consider such heretical thoughts?\nBecause when Sir Michael steps down later this year, it could be the opportunity for the government to take an axe to Ofsted's powers.\nThe Department for Education has made no secret of its irritation with the chief inspector's readiness to intervene in what it would see as areas of ministerial policy.\nHis attack on the overpaid underachievers running academies was a rather spectacular show of independence, ahead of the government's plans for all schools to become academies.\nSir Michael might have drawn the wrath of teachers' unions, but his instincts have always been public service and public sector. He's been a head teacher bristling with ambition for state school pupils to have the same chance as those in private schools.\nBut when he goes, it will remove a major brake on many of the changes that could accompany an all-academy school system.\nAcademies can set their own terms for teachers' pay and conditions, they don't have to follow the national curriculum, and if qualified teacher status is abolished, they will have much more flexibility in who can be hired.\nMany of these optouts are already in place, but schools are much less likely to take experimental shortcuts when they have Ofsted breathing down their neck.\nLikewise, academy chains have been kept on their toes by the harrying of Ofsted's group inspections.\nOfsted has been an obstacle to the type of deregulation that some free-marketeers might have anticipated.\nAppointing a new chief inspector is likely to provide ministers with a chance to rethink this role.\nAnd it could be that the regional schools commissioners become the new power brokers.\nThese rather anonymous figures are much less likely to cause trouble for ministers - and much less likely to draw public attention to any problems that emerge.\nSo the teachers' unions, having attacked Sir Michael for so long, could come to miss his disapproving stare.\nBut what about the other side of this unlikely equation?\nWhy would George Osborne want to send a bouquet to the teachers' delegates gathering in conferences this weekend?\nRight-wing opponents might like to caricature trade unions as dinosaurs from another era.\nBut there is no escaping the popularity of unions with the teaching profession.\nAbout 97% of teachers are in a union, about four times the national average.\nIt reflects the fact trade union members are increasingly likely to be middle-income graduates - and that you have to be relatively well paid to even threaten to go on strike.\nInstead of taking on these middle-class trade unionists, maybe Mr Osborne should be embracing them.\nMaybe he should be calling on other professions to follow their example.\nBecause they could help with one of his biggest problems - tackling wage stagnation and resuscitating a consumer feel-good factor.\nAny upticks in the economy since the financial crash have struggled to find their way into the nation's pay packets.\nIn both the US and UK, it's been seen as fuelling a deep sense of frustration.\nPolitical systems built on post-War growth have struggled to connect with an electorate, including the middle class, that feels like it's going backwards.\nA recent report from the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics said that in real terms average wages were still about 9% lower than before the financial crisis and that income growth showed no sign of recovering to pre-recession levels.\nThis stagnation in earnings is unlike anything since the 1920s, says the economics centre.\nReport author Stephen Machin says the decline in union membership is part of this lack of upward pressure on pay.\nEconomists have talked about a \"lost decade\" for pay increases.\nA decade without a pay rise might seem like a blip on the screen of long-term economics - but in the life of a family, it's a huge stretch of time.\nIt's the difference between getting an extra bedroom as children get older, being able to move home or to be able to afford a holiday before children grow up and leave.\nGetting by on the same money for year after year, while costs rise relentlessly, has a demoralising impact.\nProf Machin says that in the US, median pay has barely shifted upwards since the late 1970s.\nThere are many suggestions for why earnings have been frozen.\nAutomation and globalisation are both prime suspects.\nWage inequality, with extremely high pay for top executives, has also been blamed.\nBut studies in the US have highlighted a more basic structural change.\nLess of the wealth generated by companies is going into paying the staff.\nIf profits improve, it isn't going back into salaries.\nCould trade unions be the chancellor's secret weapon?\nCould they be the way to encourage employers to put more of the money back into the pockets of consumers who could then start feeling that the pay permafrost was going to thaw.\nJason Furman, chairman of US President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, recently told the BBC World Service of the link between unionisation and how pay is distributed.\n\"We've looked at data in the US for the last 100 years and found that when the share of workers in trade unions goes down, the share of income going to the bottom 90% of Americans also goes down,\" he said.\n\"And with trade union density at less than 10% right now, it shouldn't be a surprise that the share of income going to the bottom 90% of households is at a near century-long low.\"\nMaybe the weekend's teachers' union conferences should be seen by the chancellor as a positive step towards growth.\nSo this weekend, what are the odds we'll see a rousing round of applause for Ofsted followed by George Osborne rushing down to the seaside for a fraternal embrace?", "summary": "There are some things you write that you know are not going to go down well with anybody.", "id": "35875779", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The two biggest teachers' unions, the NUT and NASUWT, are gathering for their Easter conferences.

We asked four BBC pundits with a foot in either camp for their verdict on where the game will be won and lost.\nFormer England midfielders Danny Murphy and Jermaine Jenas talk tactics from an England perspective, while ex-Wales strikers John Hartson and Dean Saunders give the Welsh view.\nDanny Murphy: \"It is going to be a fascinating match-up if both teams use the same systems they did in their first games.\n\"Wales played with three centre-halves against Slovakia in a 5-4-1 shape and England played with three up front in a 4-3-3 formation.\n\"Whoever the wide men are in England's attack, they can afford to stay high and wide to stretch the Welsh defensive trio and not track back.\n\"If it is Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling again, they can go and stand outside the two wide centre-halves and ahead of the Welsh wing-backs.\n\"That would cause Wales huge problems because if their wing-backs push on at all, then they are leaving a three-on-three at the back.\n\"England have to be brave to do that, because it would make it an open game, but we need to win it and I think we should be bold. We need to start on the front foot and trust our ability.\n\"I am not expecting Wales to park the bus, though. The fact they have three points already means they can take more risks.\n\"They will be organised and have numbers behind the ball but I think they will have a go as well. That will help us, and I am confident we will come out on top.\"\nBale or Rooney? Or both? Pick your combined England-Wales team\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nJohn Hartson: \"The Wales team that manager Chris Coleman picked for the win against Slovakia is perfect for this match too.\n\"He packed the middle of the pitch with four central midfielders and had Gareth Bale looking to hit them on the counter-attack.\n\"Bale will be a constant threat because of his pace but the game will be decided by how well Wales defend.\n\"I am expecting England to change their system to a 4-4-2 to get Jamie Vardy in the team alongside Harry Kane, because of Vardy's pace.\n\"If Vardy does not play I think the Wales team will be happy because he would cause them more problems than the England team who played against Russia did.\n\"But if Wales can defend as well as they did in qualifying, when we kept seven clean sheets in 10 games and only conceded four goals, we have a chance.\n\"A key match-up will be our wing-backs versus their full-backs - who will try to get forward like they did against Russia.\n\"I don't think we will go forward as much as England, because we don't have to. We have three points and we can pick and choose when we attack.\n\"The players know that they can stay solid if they stay in formation. I think we will score, so we will win if we keep them out.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nJermaine Jenas: \"Bale's comments about Welsh players having more pride and passion than England's are just the biggest wind-up ever.\n\"I watched England's game against Russia and saw the devastation on our players' faces when they walked off the pitch with a draw when they deserved to win that game.\n\"How do you measure pride and passion anyway? Just because a team jumps on each other when they celebrate a goal, like Wales did against Slovakia, does not mean they care any more than the other team?\n\"This England team has got pride, passion and belief too. So, it was a ridiculous statement by Gareth and I was surprised he said it.\n\"He is obviously going to be well up for this game against England, because it is probably the biggest he has played in a Wales shirt.\n\"But Bale will not be going anywhere near Kyle Walker or Danny Rose down the flanks because they are both machines. Yes, he is quick but so are they and he will not get anything out of them.\n\"It is down the middle where his pace can hurt us. He will be thinking that if he can get at Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling he can do some damage.\n\"For England, I would just tweak the midfield in order to get the best out of Harry Kane up front.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"He was not at his best against Russia and I thought he missed having a partner to work with.\n\"If Wayne Rooney drops in next to Eric Dier, then Dele Alli can move further forward. He can sit in the hole behind Kane and look to slide him the ball the way he does for Tottenham.\n\"Otherwise, who is going to score England's goals? You would be looking at a repeat of Kane's performance against Russia, and we cannot go through that again.\"\nDean Saunders: \"England have one of the best attacks in the tournament and they are a massive step-up from Slovakia.\n\"But if Wales put up a wall like they did in their first game, we will be hard to break down.\n\"We did not play with a centre-forward and instead Bale, Jonny Williams and Aaron Ramsey rotated as the furthest player forward.\n\"Then we had two sitting midfielders in David Edwards and Joe Allen. Edwards had a key role against Marek Hamsik and will have another big job keeping tabs on Dele Alli in Lens.\n\"I managed Edwards when I was in charge of Wolves and he has a great football brain. When Wales attack, he won't be watching the game. He will be watching Alli and maybe moving a few yards so that when we lose the ball he is in the right place and will not have to chase him.\n\"Then our two wing-backs will bomb on and pass the ball to each other. The advantage of switching the play like that, with long diagonal balls, is that it will make it very difficult for England to launch counter-attacks.\n\"If we attack down the middle and they intercept, they can come at us quickly. But, If those diagonal balls are too long, then the ball will go out of play and Wales will have time to get back in shape.\n\"If they are headed back up the pitch by the England full-backs, then the Welsh players are in position already and, if they are perfect, then our wing-backs will be in possession and in a great position.\n\"We know England are favourites but we are a small country, making up for things with grit, determination and team spirit.\n\"'Together Stronger' is the team motto, and that is what will help to get us a positive result.\"\nWho would get in a combined XI from the England and Wales squads?

including Good Vibrations and God Only Knows using innovative and original production techniques, but who also took a lot of drugs, spent a fabled three years in bed, and put a sandpit under the piano in his lounge.\nWhere would you start?\nBy questioning the terminology if you're Bill Pohlad, who directed Love & Mercy, the new film based on the life of Brian Wilson.\n\"I always shy away from the biopic reference,\" explains Pohlad, who produced 12 Years a Slave and Brokeback Mountain.\n\"That may not be fair but biopics are trying to tell the full cradle to grave story of a person's life.\n\"When you've got somebody like Brian Wilson, who's had such an amazing life, you end up focusing so much on the celebrity parts or the bits that we've heard about, that there's not enough time to get intimate with the character and that really isn't that interesting to me\".\nSo Pohlad chose to pull out two threads from Wilson's life, which he then intertwines to make this film.\nOne strand chronicles how Brian Wilson coped with the Beach Boys' first success, the making of their 1966 album Pet Sounds and the early decline in his mental health.\nThe other strand shows Wilson in the 1980s when he was being manipulated by controversial therapist Eugene Landy, and details Wilson's relationship with Melinda Ledbetter, who would become his second wife.\nPaul Dano plays the 1960s Wilson, with John Cusack taking over the character for the 1980s alongside Elizabeth Banks as Melinda and Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy.\n\"When I cast Paul (Dano) I didn't know if he could sing or not,\" admits director Bill Pohlad.\n\"It was just that he was the guy to play Brian Wilson, it was a gut thing.\n\"Then a couple of weeks later we had one of Brian's vocal guys go to New York and meet with Paul and 45 minutes after their meeting we got this excited text video of Paul singing God Only Knows for the first time the whole way through, and it was brilliant\".\nThis fortuitous turn of events meant that Pohlad and Atticus Ross (who was in charge of the music), were able to use Dano's voice in the film for scenes showcasing how Pet Sounds came to life.\nIt still presented a conundrum though, knowing how familiar the original Beach Boys' tracks would be for much of the audience watching.\nPohlad faced the cinematic choice of getting his actors to record new vocals, like Joaquin Phoenix did for the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, or have the actors mime, like James Corden did when Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Pott's voice came out of Corden's mouth in One Chance.\nIt all affects the believability of the performance, and in the end Pohlad went for a mix.\n\"In the film Paul (Dano) sings God Only Knows and Surf's Up totally unassisted,\" he says.\n\"But in other elements we show the recording process and we start with Paul's voice and then blend Brian's voice in and the rest of the Beach Boys in to complete it with the original vocal tracks\".\nIt's worth noting that John Cusack does not sing as part of his portrayal of the older Brian Wilson.\nWhile a script about Wilson had been brewing for some time, Bill Pohlad still needed to earn the trust of Brian and his wife Melinda.\n\"I think the first question he asked me when I first met him was, 'so who's going to play me?' but he's not like that at all,\" remembers Pohlad.\n\"It was a joke because he doesn't have an ego about these things\".\nThe couple were consulted when the script was being written and also once the film went into production, but Pohlad was very much in charge of the creative and editorial vision.\n\"He was around for us,\" says Pohlad \"and he would dip in at different times when we needed guidance to say what really happened but otherwise they weren't all over us\".\nOver the course of two hours on film, Pohlad does address some of the myths and rumours that continue to swirl around Brian Wilson.\nSuch as, did hearing The Beatles' Sgt Pepper really cause Wilson to abandon Smile, the album that was to come after Pet Sounds, and instead head to bed for 1,000 days?\n\"There was a much bigger story to that,\" says Bill Pohlad.\n\"It really was a friendly rivalry but very distinct.\n\"We reference in the movie that Brian did hear Rubber Soul and it impressed him the way it was put together, and that pushed him to do Pet Sounds.\n\"And then I think someone from Brian's camp took a tape over of some of Pet Sounds and Paul (McCartney) and John (Lennon) heard it and it was like 'Oh' so they stepped up their game, and that's what sparked Sgt Pepper to a large degree.\n\"And then Brian was going to answer it again with Smile but unfortunately that was when he started experiencing more issues with his mental health as well as some drug abuse issues and the whole Smile project collapsed over a number of years.\"\nBrian Wilson Presents Smile was eventually released in 2004 following a series of sold out live performances in London.\nAs for Love & Mercy, Brian Wilson watched the movie alone at his request before it was shown at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2014.\n\"That was his decision and I respected that,\" says Pohlad.\n\"I heard from the projectionist that he came out saying he really liked it\".\nPohlad and Wilson later saw the film together, but for Wilson's wife Melinda, the initial reaction was a little different.\n\"I sat with Melinda when she first saw it, before Brian saw it and she was shocked, stunned, I think she didn't like it, so I was a little bit mortified,\" Pohlad recalls.\n\"She later told me the story that she had to drive around for two hours by herself and just put it in some context and then she saw it again with other people and everybody loved it, so she loved it and it was easier to accept at that point.\"\nIt may be very early to whisper the word \"Oscar\" but I just did and I'm not the first to do so either.\nBill Pohlad concedes while \"you don't want to be doing it for that reason\" he remains proud of the team he assembled for Love & Mercy and concedes if Oscar nominations followed next January, \"that would be great honestly if that happened\".\nLove & Mercy is released in cinemas across the UK on 10 July.\nNatalie Jamieson's interview with Bill Pohlad will be featured on Claudia Winkleman's Radio 2 Arts Show this  Friday between 22:00 and 00:00.",

The quality that we did have was in the first half on the counter-attack and it was good, intricate play to score the goal.\n\"The players gave everything for the Barnsley shirt, as they have done all season, but it was incredibly difficult to break down that yellow wall.\n\"The season's not over. We're really looking forward to going to Newcastle and spoiling their party.\"\nBurton boss Nigel Clough:\n\"I'd say this is our greatest achievement because of the clubs we have been up against this season and the strength of the league.\n\"To get 52 points and survive is a bigger achievement than actually reaching the Championship.\n\"We have had to play the likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Derby and Sheffield Wednesday, week in, week out, so there are no easy games.\n\"You look at the resources and we are on a par with a lot of teams in League One, but we're not on a par with anyone in the Championship.\n\"You have to embrace that and say 'we are the smallest club' and get like-minded players who want to come and fight against the odds.\"\nMatch ends, Barnsley 1, Burton Albion 1.\nSecond Half ends, Barnsley 1, Burton Albion 1.\nSubstitution, Barnsley.

So today we are launching, as the first phase in our new campaign, the biggest listening exercise in our party's history.\n\"It will run from now until St Andrew's Day (30 November). We want to understand in detail how people feel now about Europe, Brexit and independence.\n\"We want to know the concerns that people have and the questions that they want answered. We want to build, if we can, a consensus on the way forward\".\nMs Sturgeon said members of the public could take part through a dedicated website, and all 120,000 SNP members would be sent a \"pack of survey cards\" which they would ask five people a month for the next three months to fill in.\nAll of the party's MPs and MSPs have been instructed to hold town hall meetings, and the SNP will establish a growth commission headed by its former MSP Andrew Wilson, who is a founding partner of the Charlotte Street Partners communications agency.\nThe commission will look at the prospects for Scotland's economy and also consider key issues such as currency.\nThe first minister added: \"Our activists will be hitting the doorsteps as well, asking people to take part and delivering a new leaflet explaining why.\n\"All in all, we plan to talk to at least two million people across Scotland between now and 30 November. The wealth of information and insight we gather will then inform the next stage of our campaign\".\nMs Sturgeon - and her predecessor Alex Salmond - have repeatedly argued that the independence cause requires more, much more than SNP fervour. Both believe that, if zeal were enough, Scotland would have been independent decades ago.\nSo the FM's message today - as at the March conference when she first signalled the summer campaign - was that the advocates of independence must patiently answer the concerns and worries of voters. They must listen, not lecture.\nWhich is why I categorise today's announcement as a manoeuvre. It is emphatically not an immediate gung-ho propaganda push for independence.\nIt is not the starting pistol on a new referendum campaign. It is not the comprehensive rewriting of the independence White Paper. For one thing, this is a party initiative, not a government one. Rather, it is tentatively preparing the ground, should a referendum be sought and attempted.\nMs Sturgeon is cautious about a referendum. She wonders whether folk will heed the argument advanced by the Conservatives and others that indyref2 would simply pile problems upon existing uncertainty.\nYes, the SNP can say that it was the Tories who created the challenge by calling an EU referendum. But that is fighting a past battle, rather than addressing voters' contemporary concerns. So she ponders the public mood.\nRead more from Brian here\nMs Sturgeon had been cheered by supporters when she announced plans for a summer initiative to boost support for leaving the UK at the SNP conference in March.\nAnd she said immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU that a second independence vote was \"highly likely\".\nBut the small number of opinion polls since the EU referendum have suggested she could not yet be certain of securing a majority in favour of independence despite the Brexit vote.\nTwo recent YouGov polls - the latest of which was published in the Times on Friday morning - have suggested a narrow majority of people remain in favour of staying in the UK, with support for independence put at 47% and 46% respectively.\nSome senior SNP politicians have cautioned against rushing into a fresh referendum, with former education secretary Alex Neil recently calling for Ms Sturgeon to wait until there is a \"decisive and evident shift in support for independence over a sustained period of time\".\nIn a letter to the Scotsman newspaper, business figures including former CBI Scotland head Sir Iain McMillan and former Scottish Enterprise chief executive Jack Perry said they were concerned about the SNP's new initiative on independence.\nThe letter argues that the move would \"only add fresh uncertainty to Scotland's future at a time when small and large businesses are looking for stability\".\nThey urged the Scottish government to instead focus on \"improving our education system and skills, creating a sustainable NHS, and supporting economic growth in Scotland.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon's speech had shown she was \"prepared to ignore the priorities of the people of Scotland, in pursuit of her own narrow nationalist agenda.\"\nMs Davidson added: \"If she was really listening, she would know that most of us don't want to go back to another divisive referendum debate - we want Scotland to move on.\"\nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said: \"Instead of reforming education to give our young people the skills they need to compete for the jobs of the future, Nicola Sturgeon is deciding to drag Scotland back to the arguments of the past.\"\nAnd Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie claimed Ms Sturgeon was \"only pretending to listen\" as she had \"already decided that independence is the answer to Brexit.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour and Liberal Democrats are all opposed to holding a second referendum, meaning the SNP would likely need the support of the pro-independence Scottish Greens to get their bill through Holyrood.\nBut any referendum would also need to be approved by the UK government in order to be legally binding.\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May said in July she was \"willing to listen to options\" on Scotland's future relationship with the EU, but appeared unwilling to consider a second referendum on independence.", "summary": "Nicola Sturgeon has launched a \"new conversation\" on independence as she urged Scotland to \"control its own destiny\".", "id": "37250448", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Scottish government has said it will not hold a second independence referendum unless there is a \"material change\" in circumstances.\nThe UK government has said it will not allow a second independence referendum unless there is a \"material change\" in circumstances.\nThe UK government has said it will not allow a second independence referendum unless there is a \"material change\" in circumstances.

As he and his remaining staff locked down the premises and the gas pumps, the manager \"could see cars lined up to the south and to the north. It was chaos\".\n\"I can remember the ash falling all over, flames, you could clearly see them,\" he recalls.\nBy 17:30 local time on Tuesday 3 May - just two days after the brushfire was first discovered about 20 km (12 miles) outside the city and 45 minutes before the entire town was placed under mandatory evacuation - Katoch pilled himself and two employees into his Honda and headed home to pick up his wife and two children. His car was the only one on the road heading north.\n\"That was not a good feeling,\" he says.\nHe collected his family left the city. The usual four-and-a-half-hour drive south to Edmonton took 14.\nEvery Fort McMurray resident has a story from that day.\nFamilies were separated, people grabbed whatever they could - whether it made sense or not - and beloved family pets were left stranded.\n\"The one thing that unites us all is that there's the narrative - the initial beginning - which is that everyone had to evacuate,\" says Jordan Redshaw, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo communications manager who ran the official Twitter account throughout the crisis.\nNicknamed \"The Beast\" for its size and ferocity, the fire was the costliest insured natural disaster in Canada's history, with insurance costs totalling an estimated C$3.6bn (US$2.6bn/\u00c2\u00a32bn). Adding the costs to the government brings that price tag to C$5bn.\nAbout 10% of all structures in the town were destroyed.\nDespite the chaos, no one died in either the fire or during the evacuation.\nAt the time, Szymon Bicz told the BBC how he and his colleagues rushed into town from their work site to grab basic necessities before fleeing the city.\n\"The smoke was closing in on us. It was a very, very unpleasant experience, to be honest,\" he said.\nHe was not sure whether his rental apartment would be spared by the fire.\nHis apartment \"somehow survived,\" Bicz , who moved to Canada from Sheffield, told the BBC last week over the phone.\nHe recalls the rush to leave town at the fire advanced - driving on the sidewalks and grass to bypass vehicles abandoned in the escape.\n\"That experience was very traumatic. It was so unusual. You never get anything like this in the UK, I've never seen anything like this on such a scale. It was very, very difficult to deal with in the initial days,\" he says.\nHe says the town remains deeply affected by last year's disaster.\n\"Lots of people never (went) back. People keep selling the properties now,\" Bicz says. \"Probably they don't want to put their families through that again.\"\nBut Bicz is committed to the town and brought his family over from the UK in July. He says many have pulled together in the wake of the wildfire.\n\"All the good people who still want to be here are here, you know?\" he says.\nPainter Russell Thomas recalls the morning of 3 May as \"beautiful\".\n\"There was no smoke, anything,\" he says. He left town early for a painting workshop and only later learned the wildfire was moving quickly towards Fort McMurray.\nHe rushed back to get his family but says he \"hit a wall of fire and smoke as (the neighbourhood of) Beacon Hill was going up in flames\".\n\"Traffic came to standstill and I couldn't get back to my family,\" says Thomas. He fled south, his family fled north, finding shelter with other residents in the oil sands work camps. They eventually caught a flight to Calgary, where he met them.\nHis painting supplies were still in his car and he started painting immediately. One image, a stylised portrait of now retired Fort McMurray Fire Chief Darby Allen's tired face, ended up being shared thousands of times on social media.\n\"It somehow captured the Zeitgeist of the moment for people who were living through this thing,\" says Thomas, who thought people saw his art as a symbol of the bravery and stoicism of the fire fighters working to control the blaze.\nA number of fire fighters who fought the massive wildfire have since developed respiratory problems or mental health issues.\nAlberta wildfire authorities say the fire, which eventually spread across almost 600,000 hectares before being brought under control in July, no longer poses a danger.\nWhen the snow has completely melted, fire fighters will scan the area to destroy any remote hot spots still remaining.\nThe cause of the Fort McMurray fire remains under investigation.\nFort McMurray is likely safe from another wildfire threat for years because the blaze burned much of the natural fuel that feeds forest fires.\nThe Thomas home was undamaged, but he says he knows many for whom process of reconstruction has been hard. Over 2,500 homes were destroyed.

That corrected everyone's opinion. [I thought] what the hell has happened, something has definitely gone wrong.\"\nThough they have lost a wife, mother and aunt, Mrs Maguire's widower, Don, said the family were honouring his wife's memory by staying positive.\nThey have established a charity, The Ann Maguire Arts Educational Fund, to provide bursaries and funding for the personal development of people under 18 years of age.\nMr Maguire said: \"I may have feelings towards [the boy] but the reality of our lives is that the feelings I have won't improve our situation at all.\n\"We have all lost and we are all living without something. I have lost my wife, the children have lost their mother. It doesn't change our daily struggle.\"\nIn September, 1,200 people paid their respects to Mrs Maguire at a public memorial at Leeds Town Hall.\nAmong those attending the service were her two daughters - Emma and Kerry - and her two nephews, Daniel and Andrew Poole, who Mrs Maguire raised following her sister's death.\nTributes described her as an \"inspirational\" person who had made a \"wonderful contribution\" to education in Leeds.\nSpeaking to the BBC about her mother's death, Emma said: \"Every morning you wake up and there's a moment that you just wish that wasn't true and I don't think that will change.\n\"I think for us the reality is that Mummy doesn't come home anymore.

You're also putting your data next to someone else's.\"\nIn other words, your data could get lost, wiped, corrupted or stolen.\nThere is also a risk that by outsourcing file and data management to a third party, firms will assume all the security has been taken care of, argues Kamran Ikram, managing director of consultancy Accenture's infrastructure and security practice.\n\"You can't assume that - it's still your data and you are responsible for it.\"\nThe most obvious way is through encryption, both while the data is in transit and while it is \"at rest\" on the cloud servers, explains Ian Massingham, Amazon Web Services' (AWS) chief evangelist for Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nAWS, by far the biggest public cloud platform provider with more than a million active customers a month, has more than 1,800 security controls governing its services, says Mr Massingham.\nCustomers can choose to control their own encryption keys if they wish, he says, as well as set the rules for who can and can't access the data or applications.\n\"Most of our security innovation comes from customer demand,\" he says, \"so the bar for security gets ratcheted up every time.\n\"But we're not the owners or custodians of the data - we just supply the resources,\" he says. \"We don't control how the data is protected, customers do.\"\nIt says a lot that online retailer Amazon is happy to run its entire business on its own cloud platform.\nMark Crosbie, international head of trust and security for Dropbox, the cloud file storage and collaboration company, says the way data is encrypted can also increase the level of security.\n\"We split each data file into chunks - a process called sharding,\" he says, \"and these chunks are then separately encrypted and stored in different places, so if someone did manage to break in and decrypt the data they'd only get access to random blocks.\"\nAaron Levie, chief executive of cloud rival Box, says: \"Instead of sending the files, Box sends a link to the file - you can preview the content without actually downloading the data. Our software was designed to deliver a much more secure way of sharing content.\"\nDropbox also encourages companies to use two-factor authentication - passwords supplemented by a one-time code generated by a different device, such as a smartphone or fob.\n\"The bad guys always target the password - people are still the weakest link,\" says Mr Crosbie.\nWell, that depends on the quality of your cloud provider compared to that of your own IT department.\nMost of the major data breaches that have taken place over the last five years, from Sony to Ashley Madison, TalkTalk to Target, have been from internal, not cloud-based, databases, says Amichai Shulman, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm, Imperva.\nBut he adds: \"There is always an inherent threat that administrative personnel working for a cloud provider could access your machines or data from within - that's a business risk you are taking.\"\nThis is why the major cloud providers give customers the option to handle their own encryption keys, meaning no-one inside the provider could get access even if they wanted to.\nAnd some companies are now adopting a \"hybrid\" approach - keeping their more sensitive data in a private cloud and other data and applications in the public cloud.\nGood point. These are still early days - less than 10% of the world's data is estimated to be stored in the cloud.\n\"Financial institutions have been reluctant to go to the cloud because there may be holes in the model - they're risk averse,\" says Accenture's Kamran Ikram.\nBut even this understandably cautious sector is gradually beginning to trust it.\nLate last year, US bank Capital One said it was reducing the number of its own data centres from eight to three by 2018 and moving a lot of its processes and product development to AWS.\nAnd Towergate Insurance recently announced that it was migrating its IT infrastructure to the public cloud as well.\nThe major public cloud providers offer a number of data centres - AWS covers 12 regions globally - storing multiple copies of customer data. So if one centre is destroyed in an earthquake or other natural disaster, your data is still safe.\nBut concerns around data privacy, particularly in Europe following the rescinding of the Safe Harbour data sharing agreement and the Edward Snowden leaks, mean providers are increasingly offering the option to host data in customers' own regions.\nUS file storage and collaboration firm Box, for example, recently announced it would be expanding its data storage locations to Germany, Ireland, Singapore and Tokyo, by piggybacking on existing cloud infrastructures provided by IBM and AWS.\nHaving this choice is particularly important for heavily-regulated sectors, such as financial services and healthcare.\nThat largely depends on what you want it to do. Certain cloud providers specialise in specific functions: Salesforce for sales and customer data; Workday for finance and human resources; Box for file sharing, for example.\nBut first and foremost, a cloud provider must understand your business, says Verizon's Mr Egan.\n\"Do they understand the regulatory requirements governing payment card or health data, for example,\" he asks. \"And can they prove that they can do what they say they can do?\"\nImperva's Amichai Shulman says prospective customers should also ask to see up-to-date certificates from international security standards organisations.\nBut reputation is as good a guide as any.\nFollow @matthew_wall on Twitter", "summary": "Cloud computing - storing data and applications remotely rather than on your own premises - can cut IT costs dramatically and speed up your operations.", "id": "36151754", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe cloud is a collection of servers that are connected to the internet.\nThe cloud is a collection of servers that are connected to the internet.

It's nearly a hundred times more massive than the first robot rover Nasa sent to Mars in 1997.\nCuriosity will trundle around the foothills of Mount Sharp much like a human field geologist might walk through Mojave's valleys.  Except the rover has more than a hammer in its rucksack.\nIt has hi-res cameras to look for features of interest.  If a particular boulder catches the eye, Curiosity can zap it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting surface spark to query the rock's elemental composition.\nIf that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look.\nStill interested? Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to two high-spec analytical boxes inside the rover belly.\nThese will lay bare the rock's precise make-up, and the conditions under which it formed.\n\"We're not just scratching and sniffing and taking pictures - we're boring into rock, getting that powder and analysing it in these laboratories,\" deputy project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada, told the BBC.\n\"These are really university laboratories that would normally fill up a room but which have been shrunk down - miniaturised - and made safe for the space environment, and then flown on this rover to Mars.\"\nThe intention on Monday is to put MSL-Curiosity down on the flat plain of the crater bottom.\nThe vehicle will then drive up to the base of Mount Sharp.\nIn front of it, the rover should find clay minerals (phyllosilicates) that will give a fresh insight into the wet, early era of the Red Planet known as the Noachian. Clays only form when rock spends a lot of time in contact with water.\nAbove the clays, a little further up the mountain, the rover should find sulphate salts, which relate to the Hesperian Era - a time when Mars was still wet but beginning to dry out.\n\"Going to Gale will give us the opportunity to study a key transition in the climate of Mars - from the Noachian to the Hesperian,\" said Sanjeev Gupta, an Imperial College London scientist on the mission.\n\"The rocks we believe preserve that with real fidelity, and the volume of data we get from Curiosity will be just extraordinary.\"\nThe rover is not a life-detection mission; it does not possess the capability to identify any bugs in the soil or huddled under rocks (not that anyone really expects to find microbes in the cold, dry, and irradiated conditions that persist at the surface of Mars today).\nBut what Curiosity can do is characterise any organic (carbon-rich) chemistry that may be present.\nAll life as we know it on Earth trades off a source of complex carbon molecules, such as amino acids - just as it needs water and energy.\nPrevious missions, notably the Viking landers in the 1970s, have hinted at the presence of organics on Mars. But if Curiosity could make the definitive identification of organics in Gale Crater, it would be a eureka moment and go a long way towards demonstrating that the Red Planet did indeed have habitable environments in its ancient past.\nIt's a big ask, though.  Even in Earth rocks where we know sediments have been laid down in proximity to biology, we still frequently find no organic traces. The evidence doesn't preserve well.\nAnd, of course, there are plenty of non-biological processes that will produce organics, so it wouldn't be an \"A equals B\" situation even if Curiosity were to make the identification.\nNonetheless, some members of the science team still dream of finding tantalising chemical markers in Gale's rocks.\nDawn Sumner, from the University of California at Davis, is one of them.\n\"Under very specific circumstances - if life made a lot of organic molecules and they are preserved and they haven't reacted with the rocks in Gale Crater, we may be able to tell that they were created by life. It's a remote possibility, but it's something I at least hope we can find,\" she said.\n\"I am confident we will learn amazing new things.  Some of them will be answers to questions we already have, but most of what we learn will be surprises to us.\n\"We've only been on the ground on Mars in six places, and it's a huge planet.\n\"Gale Crater and Mount Sharp are unlike anything we've been to before.  That guarantees we will learn exciting new things from Curiosity.\"\nHorizon: Mission to Mars was broadcast on BBC Two Monday 30 July.

He feels that the streets aren't safe, and both home and the Mouvement Social centre that Ali attends in lieu of school are full of people.\nThe roof is one of the only places he can be alone and relax, even though there's not much to do up there other than mess about with the hose or water the plants.\nHe said: \"The roof is my safe space.  There's nothing special about it.  Just when I'm upset or angry, I go to the roof and I feel calm because I look at the space and the big buildings.\"\nBeirut's coastline often makes many of the children feel safe.  Aslan, 12, loves going down to the sea with his family.\nHe said: \"I like it that there is sun in the picture and the sea is very calm. I like it when the sky is blue and you can only hear the sound of the sea. Then I feel that everything is calm. And I feel relaxed.\"\nMany children chose to focus on an individual or group of people who made them feel secure.  Alma, the fifth of eight children in her family, photographed her elder brother.\nShe said: \"I really, really love him, and whatever I ask of him he always does for me.  He loves me too.\"\nSeveral children enjoyed taking pictures of old photographs and using these as a way of depicting their happy memories of safe spaces in Syria.\nStephanie, 14, took this picture of an old snap of her cousin by a little river near her grandfather's land in the countryside near Homs.\nShe said: \"Each and every holiday, we would go to my grandparents' house, and the first thing I'd do in the morning was ask to go there.  I feel like I'm an explorer when I go there.\"\nMany of the children photographed activities within the Mouvement Social centre, where they go every day and see their friends, teachers and the counsellor.  Noody, 15, took this picture of the younger children in a drama class.\nHe said: \"They were relaxed and it was a safe space so I wanted to take a picture.\"\nLeila, 11, photographed the view from her window through a transparent curtain embroidered with flowers.\nShe said: \"This means that I like flowers, and the clouds, and the area I live in. And it says that I like high places. I feel comfortable when I look at the sky. I really like the clouds.\"\nJihan, 15, from the Aleppo countryside, took a series of pictures of the view from her balcony at home, followed by one of her looking out over the city.\nShe said: \"I really feel comforted when I look at the sky.  I don't know why, but it looks clear and it makes me feel clear.\"\nIn this way, Jihan finds her own sense of space and freedom.\nIbo, 17, told the story of a safe space within Syria - a cave he and his family had dug out as a bomb shelter when the area they lived in came under heavy attack.\nHe took pictures of old photographs taken at the time.\nHe said : \"This is me and my littlest sister, in the days when we were living in the cave.  We made it very warm and cosy in there. Inside, the temperature was always the opposite of outside\u200a -\u200ain summer it was cool, and in winter it was warm. We used to sleep in there. We couldn't feel the difference between day and night, because there was no light.\"\nHayleen, 14, is from an area of Syria that has seen heavy fighting and experienced a lot of bombing.  Her family had to leave their house and live in a school that had been turned into a collective shelter, with many other families, for several months before fleeing to Beirut.\nShe brought her teddy bear through all of this.\nShe said: \"I can't sleep without this, I don't know why. I love it a lot. I've had it since I was really small.  I brought it with me when I came to Lebanon.\"\nTechnology allows young people to maintain the bonds linking them to family still in Syria, using communication to establish each other's safety. Rania, from Aleppo, took images from the instant messaging service WhatsApp.\nShe said: \"I like WhatsApp and use it to stay in touch with people.

built in Byzantine times but later booby-trapped, mined and pockmarked by artillery fire - have been crumbling gently in the middle of a minefield.\nIt was laid mainly by Israeli troops during the 1967 War, when Israel captured the land west of the River Jordan, known today as the occupied West Bank.\nThe sensitivities of the site have made clearing it and making it safe something of a political minefield that the British charity, the Halo Trust, has had to negotiate with caution, making clear its credentials as a neutral humanitarian mine-clearance organisation.\nMore than 300,000 pilgrims make the journey every year to the west bank of the River Jordan to the baptism site known as Qasr El-Yahud.\nIts name is said to come from the \"Crossing of the Jews\", as it is where Joshua is believed to have led the Israelites and the Ark of the Covenant over the river to safety.\nThe site on the riverbank is once again a major place of pilgrimage for Christians around the world since its reopening in 2011.\nIn fact, it is one of the most important Christian sites in the Holy Land.\nPope Saint John Paul II visited by helicopter in 2000.\nAnd, in 2014, Pope Francis went to the Jordanian site on the opposite bank of the river, before he entered Israel.\nThe Halo Trust is well aware of the many sensitivities involved here, and has spent much time negotiating the agreement to make safe this sacred site, hoping not just to clear the mines but to help build links between fractured communities.\nAgreement was reached not only with the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, but also with the seven Orthodox denominations represented on the site - by the Greek, Russian, Syrian, Coptic, Romanian and Ethiopian churches, as well as a plot of land owned by the Armenians - and the Roman Catholics, represented on the site by a Franciscan church.\nThe Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, describes it as a \"great sign of reconciliation\" and a way of illuminating the sacred history connected to the land.\nThe Halo Trust is already involved in other mine-clearance projects in the West Bank, but this may be its most challenging yet from the perspective of keeping united all those with a stake in the clearance of this high-profile site.\nThe Holy Land has long been a place where sacred sites can divide, rather than unite.\nAccording to Michael Heiman, technology and standards manager at the Israeli National Mine Action Authority, one of the reasons that the area was not made safe sooner was thanks to fears that the churches could suffer further damage during the clearance.\nAs we walk cautiously closer towards the sealed-off churches, the West Bank project manager at the Halo Trust, Ronen Shimoni, says the 1-sq-km (0.4-sq-mile) site contains more than 2,600 anti-tank mines, another 1,200 anti-personnel mines, and an unknown number of booby-traps within the churches, as well as unexploded ordnance left behind after the fighting.\nThose carrying out the actual clearance of the site will be Georgians who have already worked on other projects here, although the director of the Palestinian Mine Action Centre, Brig Juma Abdeljabbar, says Palestinians will be involved as part of the wider team.\n\"We have one and a half million mines in the Palestinian Territories and the Jordan Valley,\" he says.\n\"There are a huge number of mines and unexploded ordnance in some areas.\n\"There are kids who don't realise the danger of these things and they collect one and take it home, then they play with it, so it explodes.\n\"We have an injury every 10 days because of the unexploded ordnance.\"\nWith the temperature rising to over 40C, Major General James Cowan, chief executive of the Halo Trust, visits the site with us, treading carefully beside the barbed wire fences bearing signs warning of mines.\nThe site is otherwise sealed off to visitors, with buses full of pilgrims speeding straight past on the road that leads down to the river.\nAs a former commander of British forces in Helmand, Afghanistan, from 2009-10, after serving in Iraq and Northern Ireland, Major General Cowan became all too familiar with the human cost of war.\n\"This project means a lot to me,\" he says.\n\"I used to be a soldier, and I served in lots of places where mines were killing and injuring soldiers.\n\"Many of my friends and comrades were hurt or killed by improvised explosive devices.\n\"So it matters to me on a personal level, as well. \"\n\"Our purpose is to return this very ancient site to its former purpose, to something that will endure long into the future, and help the Christian communities, the Israelis and Palestinians and all mankind to be able to come here.\n\"The great joy of being able to clear it of landmines is that once a mine is gone, it's gone forever, so pilgrims can come and they can celebrate all that this place means.\"\nThat afternoon, Canon Andrew White - best known as the \"Vicar of Baghdad\" - visits the site, viewing the project as one that brings hope of a rebirth on many levels.\n\"This is a site of restoration, and we hope not just of restoration but also of reconciliation and of rebuilding relationships,\" he says.\n\"I would love to see this place, so known for destruction and death, become a place where those who have hated each other can come together as friends.\"\nThe work itself will not be easy or quick; it is likely to take between 18 and 20 months.\nThe soil is treacherous, and prone to flooding, meaning that mines have moved from where they may originally have lain.\nThere is also the small matter of the $4m (\u00a32.7m) the Halo Trust needs to raise before the demining can be completed.\nThen, the plan is for the site to be designated a national park, rather than a military area.\nPeace in the Middle East may still be a distant dream, but at least this one small but significant corner of disputed land may soon be cleared of the deadly debris of war.", "summary": "The soil is parched clay and crackles underfoot, and the only sound we can hear is birdsong.", "id": "36213369", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "The Halo Trust is well aware of the many mine-clearance projects in the West Bank, but this may be its most challenging yet from the perspective of keeping united all those with a stake in the clearance of this high-profile site.\nThe Holy Land has long been a place where sacred sites can divide, rather than unite.

these are highly talented people at the very forefront of scientific discovery and we can't afford to lose them.\n\"This is the world's greatest fusion lab and if we don't find a way to make an agreement with Europe, this will all go - and our lead in this area will have been dissipated and I think that's an enormous shame.\"\n\"We'd be bonkers to close it down, and Europe would be bonkers to close it down, but these are uncertain times.\"\nEuropean funding runs at about 60m euros a year and the big unknown is whether that will continue - or at what level - once the UK leaves the EU.\nUnder the current arrangement, the UK contributes about 45m euros a year to Europe's fusion programme - and gets more money back with \u00a345m a year to run the JET facility plus another \u00a37m a year to support research.\nA five-year contract is in place but it only runs until 2018 so concerns are focused on what happens after then.\nOver the decades, hundreds of European scientists and engineers have spent time at Culham to work at JET and for many years there was even a European school for their children.\nAt lunchtime in the canteen recently, I met European members of staff who all said they were uncertain about their futures.\nStanislav Pamela, a theorectical physicist from France, told me: \"I think it's quite worrying to know what's going to happen after the current contract has expired.\n\"It's a concern not only for the European people here but also for the English people because it puts the whole institute at risk.\"\nLidia Peron, an Italian physicist, said: \"I'm a little bit worried about my family - what's going to happen to my children, if the work is going to continue.\"\nDamien Karkinsky, a software engineer with dual UK-Bulgarian nationality, summed up the uncertainty view by saying \"nobody knows what will happen\".\n\"We don't want to move our jobs but if the EU decides to close the programme, we may have to find different places of employment.\"\nThe belief at the Culham centre is that having proved the basic science of fusion, the project is moving into a phase of engineering in which designs for an affordable commercial reactor are explored.\nAt the site, a smaller research reactor known as MAST is going through a \u00a350m upgrade and, together with JET, it is meant to provide invaluable data on different designs and materials for a future reactor.\nThe information gained from this research is seen as crucial for shaping a massive international fusion effort, an experimental fusion reactor known as ITER, being built at Cadarache in southern France - many of whose design features are derived from work at Culham..\nAnd, beyond ITER, plans are already being developed for the first fusion power station, a project called DEMO - British officials had high hopes that Culham would land the prestigious task of designing it. Now they are much less confident.\nIn the meantime, any future arrangements for Culham will depend on settling several fundamental questions.\nFirst, as a member of the EU, the UK is also a member of a related body called Euratom which co-ordinates nuclear research across the EU - will the UK automatically leave that too in March 2019?\nSecond, Europe's fusion funds are channelled via a collaborative organisation called EUROfusion. That also includes Switzerland - which is outside the EU - so would Britain try to negotiate a similar kind of membership and how long would that take?\nThird, EUROfusion comes under the EU's Horizon 2020 research programme which non-EU countries can be part of, provided they contribute funds to it.\nSo will the UK government be willing to continue writing the cheques? And, if it is, will it run into similar problems to Switzerland which is a participant but may be denied funds because of its restrictions on freedom of movement?\nStaff at Culham are running through a range of possible scenarios for their future from the worst-case of closure to one in which work continues.\nTheir hope is that the UK will agree to contribute to the Horizon 2020 programme post-Brexit and so enable funds to continue flowing to fusion research, and that work permits will be easily available for European scientists and engineers.\nBut clarity on the likely outcome is not easy to come by. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy declined requests for an interview with science minister Jo Johnson.\nA spokesperson said: \"There has been no change in our participation in the EU's nuclear fusion research programme.\n\"The UK is a key contributor to joint EU research projects and we will be working closely with our EU partners to ensure international collaboration in this field continues.\"\nThe spokesperson referred me to earlier statements that the UK would underwrite any commitments under Horizon 2020 made before the UK leaves the EU.\nEUROfusion declined to comment beyond guiding me to a statement posted the day after the referendum which said: \"We will be working hard to continue the collaboration after 2018.

The deal was a \"win-win\" for both sides said Vietjet chief executive Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao.\nThere were other orders, but nothing to compare, say, with Boeing's haul of $101bn worth of deals unveiled two years ago.\n\"I think everyone's more than adequately ordered,\" says Richard Aboulafia, vice president at US-based aerospace consultancy Teal Group. \"The Gulf carriers are still expanding, but the existing orders will do the job.\"\nOne constraint on new orders is that the production lines of Airbus and Boeing are full for years to come. Analysts at IHS Global Insight estimate that there is a backlog of 750 aircraft from Gulf airlines alone.\nAs Boeing Commercial Airplanes president Raymand Conner said, airlines may now have to wait for deliveries so long into future, with unknown economic and geo-political uncertainties, that a slowdown in the order pace was inevitable.\nThere were no orders for Airbus' super-jumbo, the A380, whose wings are made in the UK. Doubts about the aircraft's future refuse to go away, despite Airbus saying it fully committed to production.\nHowever, there were, at least, positive noises from potential customers. Emirates reiterated its interest in a re-engineered A380 to make it more fuel efficient and possibly longer, or \"stretched\" to carry more passengers.\nTurkish Airlines' chief investment officer Ahmet Bolat also said his company was very interested in buying a new A380 variant, although any order would certainly not match the 140 aircraft that Emirates has in the air or ready for future delivery.\nHowever, Airbus is highly unlikely to commit to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn ($2.1bn; \u00c2\u00a31.4bn)-plus development cost of a new A380 without firm promises of a big order.\nMeanwhile, announcements and news about defence deals came thick and fast - something of a surprise given the sensitivity of doing arms business in the Middle East.\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, fighting in both Yemen against Houthi rebels and as part of the US-led coalition against so-called Islamic State, opened their chequebooks.\nAmong UAE orders was a $1.27bn deal for an upgraded Saab surveillance system, while Lockheed Martin secured a contract to service fighter jet target and radar systems.\nAmong other orders publicly disclosed, was one from Lebanon, for an undisclosed price, aircraft from Embraer Defense & Security. And Boeing disclosed that it is in \"serious conversation\" with five potential customers for its Maritime Surveillance Aircraft, a long-range spying plane.\nWith oil revenues falling, there was doubt among analysts about whether Middle East states would be big buyers at the Dubai show.\nBut the worsening security situation in the region has encouraged states to spend, especially on urgent operational requirements, said IHS analyst Ben Moores.\nThe US had a huge defence presence with all the major firms on show, plus a string of high level officials and military top brass.\nBut there is frustration that defence firms, trying to adjust to falling revenues in the US and Europe, could be selling more in the Middle East and beyond if Washington would speed up regulatory approval for exports.\nDuring a press conference, US Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she would look at how to speed up clearance of sales overseas.\nThe US estimates that exports in the 12 months to the end of September were $47bn, against $34.2bn in the previous 12 months.\nBut Boeing was among several companies to warn that some orders were going elsewhere because of US approval delays. It is causing \"a lot of concerns\" and \"frustration\" for companies and potential buyers, said Jeff Kohler, an executive at Boeing's defence division.\nOne theme to emerge strongly from recent commercial and defence spending by Gulf states is how they are using the deals to put down manufacturing and engineering roots, helping to diversify the economies away from oil and tourism.\nSaudi Arabian Airlines said it is building a one million square metre aircraft repair and overhaul facility at Jeddah airport after announcing a tie-up with Deutsche Technik, the world's biggest aircraft maintenance group.\nMeanwhile, Abu Dhabi-based Strata announced that it was building an R&D operation, becoming not just a company that builds parts for others, but one that is developing new manufacturing technologies.\nStrata, which is part of investment giant Mubadala, already makes wing parts for Airbus and components for Boeing.\nThe move will promote technological development within the aerospace industry and the UAE's manufacturing sector as a whole, said Strata chief executive, Badr Al Olama.\nThey are baby-steps against the size of manufacturing investment outside the Gulf, but underline the ambition. That's why the airshow held a Futures Day, in which 3,000 UAE university and college students attended a series of events to promote careers in aerospace.\nThe UAE even has its own space programme (you couldn't miss it at the show) to send an unmanned mission to Mars by 2021.\nA vanity project?

I was briefed on the successful certification of HMS Vengeance and her crew.\"\nShe added: \"I have absolute faith in our independent nuclear deterrent. I believe we should continue to have that for the future, the House of Commons voted for that.\"\nThe Trident system was acquired by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s as a replacement for the Polaris missile system, which the UK had possessed since the 1960s.\nTrident came into use in the 1990s. There are three parts to it - submarines, missiles and warheads. Although each component has years of use left, they cannot last indefinitely.\nThe current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the late 2020s.\nA guide to the Trident debate\nEarlier, Julian Lewis said Mrs May had been \"handed a no-win situation\" by her predecessor as Prime Minister, David Cameron, whose \"spin doctors\" had been responsible for a \"cover-up\".\nHe told Today that the government usually released film footage of the \"99%\" of missile tests deemed a success and that ministers could not \"have it both ways\" by not announcing when this had not been the case.\nBut a spokesman for Mr Cameron said: \"It is entirely false to suggest that David Cameron's media team covered up or suggested a cover-up for the Trident missile test.\"\nCaroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, called for \"full disclosure\", adding: \"A missile veering off course is deeply concerning. Imagine such a failure occurring in a 'real-world' situation - it could lead to the slaughter of millions of people in an ally's country.\"\nKate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: \"There's absolutely no doubt that this would have impacted on the debate in Parliament.\"\nBut former nuclear submarine commander and Ulster Unionist Party assembly member, Steve Aiken, told Today that any fault \"would have been sorted out\".\n\"There is a convention that we don't talk about the deterrent... because that is the nature of the deterrent - it is about the security of this nation and I would fully support the prime minister in avoiding those questions,\" he said.", "summary": "Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has refused to divulge \"operational details\" of what happened during a Trident test last June.", "id": "38714047", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe UK has four Vanguard-class submarines, each armed with 16 Trident II D5 missiles.\nThe missiles are launched from the submarines' tubes, which are 11 metres (36ft) long and 2.5 metres (8ft) in diameter.\nThe missiles are launched from the submarines' tubes, which are 11 metres (36ft) long and 2.5", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Trident missile test was a failure.\nThe Trident missile test was a success.\nThe Trident missile test was a success, but the government covered it up.\nThe Trident missile test was a success, but the government did not cover it up.\nThe Trident missile test was a failure, but the government covered it up.\nThe Trident missile test was a failure, but the government did not cover it up.\nThe", "decode_al_05_be_12_lay_2": "\nThe UK's nuclear deterrent is a key part of our national security.

For the first time in its 148-year history it endorsed a Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.\nIt was also a first in 126 years for the Arizona Republic.\nDonald J Trump was not popular with America's newspapers. Of the 100 top circulation print newspapers, two endorsed him.\nMore than 200 newspapers supported Clinton, while Trump received the backing of fewer than 20.\nAnd even some of this support was half-hearted, to say the least. The best the Fort Wayne News Sentinel could come up with was \"Thank God for Mike Pence\".\nThe Washington Times declared Trump imperfect and acknowledged his \"vulgarity and coarseness\".\nWhat they did like was the fact that he had \"all the right enemies: the pundits, the 'social scientists', the Beltway insiders, the academics and the righteous mongers of failed policies.\"\nHis image, they felt, was being painted by a \"one-party media\".\nTrump's victory, then, was a brutal kick in the teeth for those loathed pundits, insiders and \"righteous mongers\". But it was also a humiliation for the thousands of journalists who had spent months trying to warn the public about Donald J Trump.\nThis was one almighty, two-fingered salute to much of the \"mainstream media\".\nProf Jeff Jarvis - of the Tow-Knight Centre for entrepreneurial journalism, City University New York, and an enthusiastic and active supporter of Hillary Clinton - stated it simply.\n\"The mere fact of Donald Trump's candidacy is evidence of the failure of journalism,\" he believes.\nHe, like many other members of the liberal media class, feels Trump's success is a sign that the media failed to communicate the truth with enough force.\nHe believes equating the issue of Hillary Clinton's email server with all of the criticisms of Donald Trump in the name of balance was misleading.\nThe frequent comparison is with the climate change debate and the \"balance\" of expert opinion. A second (liberal) view is that the media gave Trump far too much unfiltered airtime.\nRather than being appalled, large parts of the audience liked what they were watching. In essence, it's felt that print journalism failed to tell the real story - and that TV gave Trump a free pass.\nWhether you agree, it assumes two things. First, that the news industry has a moral purpose. Second, that TV is still the most powerful medium.\nWhatever you make of the first statement, the second seems to be truer than many of the digital evangelists would have you believe.\nIn 1968 Roger Ailes, the future boss of Fox News, had a problem: how to get Richard Nixon on television without it being controlled and filtered by what he felt was a hostile media.\nHis solution was to create his own staged Nixon TV specials and offer them to TV stations. Forty-eight years later, CNN was effectively doing the same for Trump - free of charge.\nThe enthusiasm for Trump at CNN was simple: ratings. Jeff Zucker, the boss of CNN, is also the man who employed him to present The Apprentice when he worked at NBC.\nZucker, perhaps more than anyone else, turned Trump into a TV star.\nTrump's repeated denunciations of CNN following a documentary he felt was deeply flawed rather overlook the success of their relationship. Trump brought CNN ratings in a tough TV market, and he got exposure in return.\nNo-one knew what he was going to say, so the cameras were never going to cut away. We now have an unpredictable and telegenic president, whom the cameras and ratings will follow wherever he goes.\nHowever, what's strange about Trump's speeches is how much of what he says refers to issues and topics that are not part of the mainstream news agenda.\nDuring the summer of 2016, Donald Trump stated again and again that Hillary Clinton \"invented Isis\". It's not a claim that receives much support in most newspapers or websites.\nOn Alex Jones' Infowars site, though, it was big news. The site also features claims that Clinton has a secret \"Satanic Network\" and has Parkinson's disease, as well as dozens of other conspiracy theories.\nAnalyse Trump's speeches and there are references to dozens of stories that are dismissed by most mainstream media but have enthusiastic support in the growing world of alternative news sources.\nAnd this \"fringe\" is generating large amounts of traffic. The online analytics company Tubular Insights identified in the middle of the campaign that when it came to online news, the site creating videos that were generating the greatest levels of engagement (likes, shares etc) was Infowars.\nAnother star of what has become known as the \"alt-right\" is Breitbart, a news website with an agenda opposed to anything it deems politically correct or multicultural.\nIt's Alexa online ranking puts it above the LA Times, the New York Post, Vox, Slate and the New Yorker, not to mention CBS, NBC and ABC's news sites.\nIf you want to understand how close Breitbart is to Trump, look at Steve Bannon, an executive chairman of Breitbart who became the Trump campaign's chief executive.\nBannon is a former employee of Goldman Sachs and has a Harvard MBA. But politically he is at the heart of the anti-establishment, anti-mainstream media right wing of America.\nBannon is a man who also shares all the right enemies. But how do we know people believe him any more than other parts of the media?\nIn the midst of the election campaign, the social media analysts Impact Social studied posts on Twitter and other social media platforms in Florida.\nOnce they'd stripped out the pundits, journalists and the rest of the chattering classes, they saw Trump was well ahead of Clinton when it came to positive comments. This ran counter to the polls, which were giving Clinton a small lead.\nPollsters would dismiss social media as a self-selecting group that doesn't reflect the whole voting population. But it does perhaps give a clue to the emotional impact of a candidate.\nTrump was giving people more to talk about and saying it in a way that resonated. When it came to \"share of voice\" online, he was winning.\nThe need for headlines that bring clicks and stories that get shared has changed everything. Dull, balanced articles (like this one) don't provoke fury, laughter or much in the way of emotion.\nTrump was simply more entertaining and generating more passion.

As I write, they still have not spoken to each other.\nAs you know, from time to time, it's worth passing on the conspiracy theories that will never be proven or otherwise in Westminster. At the end of one of the most astonishing days in politics for years, here are three different accounts I've heard today of what went on.\nThe truth is probably a mixture of them all. But for the conspiracists out there, here goes, and neither camp would officially deny or confirm any of the scenarios below.\nConspiracy One\nMichael Gove was always a \"cuckoo\" in the Boris Johnson campaign team. He arrived at the Johnson's farmhouse on Sunday after the two men had done a deal on Saturday night that Mr Gove would co-chair his campaign. They had also agreed, I'm told, that he would be Boris Johnson's chancellor if he moved into Number 10.\nBut he arrived with his advisers in tow, having tipped off the press as to the location and timing of the meeting. At that meeting, it's claimed that Mr Gove's team demanded the list of Boris Johnson's supporters, but his campaign team refused to hand over the spreadsheet with the names of their backers.\nIt's suggested that Mr Gove then leaked the story to the Telegraph that George Osborne would be Mr Johnson's foreign secretary, and demanded that his former adviser, Dominic Cummings, be given a senior role in Number 10.\nThen yesterday an email miraculously made its way into the public domain, written by Mr Gove's wife, Sarah Vine, that urged him to demand a significant role and to stand up to Mr Johnson. People close to Mr Johnson just don't believe that all those things were a coincidence. They claim \"it was an operation\" from the start and they suspect that George Osborne's influence may be behind it.\n\"It was proper treachery,\" they say, and as soon as Mr Gove announced this morning, MPs described as the \"inner circle gang\" all peeled off and withdrew their support for Mr Johnson.\nOnce it was out there, \"the momentum went, the direction went\". And Boris Johnson and his team weren't willing to stay and have a nasty fight.\nThe irony is, that Mr Gove is the man who persuaded Boris Johnson to take the political risk of backing Brexit, only, after their victory, to sharpen his knife, then stab him repeatedly in the back.\nMichael Gove was persuaded to campaign for Boris Johnson after a bruising referendum contest where they worked together to persuade the country to vote to Leave.\nMr Gove believed that Mr Johnson's crowd-pulling communication skills were what was needed to sell the post-EU deal to the country, and they could work together successfully as a team, after knowing each other for decades.\nBut since the referendum result, Boris Johnson refused to focus on the job in hand, he messed up some of the dealings with other colleagues like Andrea Leadsom, and Mr Gove gradually lost confidence in his ability to step up to the biggest job in politics.\nAfter other colleagues had tried to persuade him to stand in recent days, having changed his mind about Mr Johnson's abilities, he decided reluctantly that he was the man for the job.\nThe reason? His genuine belief that only someone who campaigned to leave the EU, can be in charge. Mr Cummings has nothing to do with it, and, as he said to me, he is not taking any part in the leadership campaign, even though another source tells me that he had said he might \"offer thoughts\".\nThis theory suggests that Mr Gove tried repeatedly to phone Mr Johnson this morning to break the news, but couldn't get hold of him, so instead he called Lynton Crosby, Boris's long-time political strategist.\nOver the weekend, Boris Johnson's team started to gather support in earnest, promising an early election and an increased majority. MPs in the centre of the party mull it over, and contemplating an early election, the huge uncertainties after the referendum result, and the possibility that Labour might oust Jeremy Corbyn and improve in the polls, are circumspect about swinging immediately behind Boris Johnson.\nI'm told that Boris Johnson had 81 nominations last night, not far from the 111 needed, but not enough, either, to be completely confident of ending up on the ballot.\nThe numbers were softer than they might have wanted as the heavy favourites, and less than the 100 or so that had been expected as he came out of the gate. Then right-wing Tories, mainly Brexiters, weren't quite ready to trust Boris Johnson and were concerned about Remainers being part of his team.\nMichael Gove then, alarmed at the softness of support for Mr Johnson, concluded that he was tying himself into a project that was doomed to fail. Rather than see it through, with Boris Johnson no longer looking like he'd sweep all before him, he decided he had a decent shot, so betrayed his friend in order to do it.\nThere are spooky parallels to what was suggested to me a few months back.\nHe swears it is true, but not many people in Westminster tonight believe that Mr Gove had a sudden change of heart.\nOne Number 10 source told me tonight, he's guilty of a \"double treachery\", first betraying his friend David Cameron by joining the Out Campaign and now carrying out this political assassination of Boris Johnson too.\nBut MPs are utterly furious at what he has done. If he wins, getting his colleagues to trust him will be a tall order. Others feel of course that Mr Johnson is guilty of total irresponsibility, having won the referendum campaign, which he took on for his own ambition, then walking away in the face of what looked like a difficult fight.\nIt's of course possible that he might have beaten Mr Gove, and gone on to achieve his greatest ambition. But he, and we will now never know.\nThe only thing that's clear tonight is that there is one beneficiary, Theresa May. Her job and intention today was to look calm, sober, and powerful. She may well have achieved that anyway, it was an impressive launch.

It is expected to report in December.\nThe second will be led by former Court of Appeal judge Dame Janet Smith DB and will examine the culture of the BBC during the years that Savile worked there. The results are expected in spring 2013.\nPanorama found that at an awards luncheon at the Hilton hotel on 2 December 2011, BBC director of news Helen Boaden told Mr Entwistle, the then director of Vision - which oversees BBC TV commissioning and programming - about the Newsnight investigation and its possible impact on the planned tributes to Savile.\nMs Boaden told him that if the Newsnight investigation went ahead, he might have to change the Christmas schedules. The conversation is said to have taken \"less than 10 seconds\".\nBoth Mr Entwistle and Ms Boaden have not provided responses to the points raised by Panorama.\nJohn Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee - which will take evidence from the director general on Tuesday - said the reasons for dropping the Newsnight report remained unclear and insisted Mr Entwistle had serious questions to answer.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Whittingdale said: \"If you were the director of Vision, you were told at the time you were commissioning programmes paying tribute to Jimmy Savile that Newsnight might be about to reveal a bombshell, you wouldn't just have a 10-second conversation.\n\"You'd say, 'tell me more, I'm about to go public putting out these programmes making out that Jimmy Savile was this saint'.\n\"And yet it appears from this he didn't even ask a question about what the Newsnight investigation was about.\"\nBoth Mr Jones and fellow Newsnight journalist Liz MacKean told Panorama that the story they had worked on for a month was halted when they felt it was close to transmission.\nMr Jones said he was certain the story would eventually come out and the BBC would be accused of a cover-up.\n\"In fact I wrote an email to Peter saying 'the story is strong enough' and the danger of not running it is 'substantial damage to BBC reputation'.\"\nLiz MacKean said of Mr Rippon's decision to drop the story: \"All I can say is that it was an abrupt change in tone from, you know, one day 'excellent, let's prepare to get this thing on air' to 'hold on'.\"\nShe added: \"I was very unhappy the story didn't run because I felt we'd spoken to people who collectively deserved to be heard and they weren't heard and I thought that was a failing... I felt very much that I'd let them down.\"\nMs MacKean also expressed concern about how the decision to abandon the story has been portrayed at the highest levels of the BBC as being about Surrey Police's investigation.\nSpeaking to Panorama she said: \"Ever since the decision was taken to shelve our story, I've not been happy with the public statements made by the BBC. I think they're very misleading about the nature of the investigation we were doing.\n\"The story we were investigating was very clear cut. It was about Jimmy Savile being a paedophile and using his status as a charity fundraiser and television presenter to get access to places where there were vulnerable teenage girls he could abuse.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC, Radio 4's Media Show presenter, Steve Hewlett, said the way the organisation had explained its reasons for dropping the Newsnight report were at best partial and arguably misleading - and had fuelled suspicion about corporate influence in the decision.\nOn 5 October 2012, the BBC's Mr Entwistle wrote to staff about the controversy: \"The BBC Newsnight programme investigated Surrey Police's enquiry into Jimmy Savile towards the end of 2011.\"\nMr Jones immediately emailed Mr Entwistle taking issue with that account. He wrote: \"George - one note - the investigation was into whether Jimmy Savile was a paedophile - I know because it was my investigation. We didn't know that Surrey Police had investigated Jimmy Savile - no-one did - that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his victims.\"\nVeteran BBC foreign editor John Simpson said the questions swirling around the BBC's handling of the Newsnight investigation is the worst crisis to hit the public broadcaster in his almost 50-year career.\n\"All we have as an organisation is the trust of the people, the people that watch us and listen to us and if we don't have that, if we start to lose that, that's very dangerous I think for the BBC.\"\nPanorama: Jimmy Savile - What the BBC Knew, BBC One, Monday, 22 October at 22:35 BST and then available in the UK on theBBC iPlayer.", "summary": "The Newsnight producer behind the dropped Sir Jimmy Savile investigation warned his editor that the BBC was at risk of being accused of a cover-up.", "id": "20024074", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe BBC has been accused of a cover-up over its decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Jimmy Savile.\nThe Newsnight investigation was halted in October 2011, just days before it was due to be broadcast.\nThe BBC has said it was because of a police investigation into Savile, but the programme's journalists have told the BBC's Panorama programme that the decision was taken because the story was not strong enough.\nThe BBC", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe BBC's director general George Entwistle has resigned over the Jimmy Savile scandal.\nThe BBC's director general George Entwistle has resigned over the Jimmy Savile scandal.

She will vote and pay tax, shop and do her own chores. If the couple have children, they will not be royal.\nBut her departure means one fewer to carry out official duties. It is also reigniting debate about the shrinking monarchy, the role women play in it and future succession.\nEmperor Akihito, 83, has already indicated that he wants to step down. As the female royals get married, the monarchy is expected to contract further.\nThere is only one boy among the younger royals, 10-year-old Prince Hisahito. If nothing changes, the future of the imperial institution will rest solely with him.\n\"If you think about it there is a possibility that all but Prince Hisahito will leave the royal household in 10 to 15 years time,\" said Isao Tokoro, professor emeritus at Kyoto Sangyo University.\n\"I think it [the engagement] gave us an opportunity to think about the problem. The system should be reformed urgently so we don't lose more members from the Imperial family.\"\nUnder Japan's Imperial Household Law of 1947, princesses who marry commoners are removed from the royal family.\nThat same law slashed the number of Japanese royals, removing 11 out of 12 branches of the imperial family as a cost-cutting measure. That means there are no royal males for current princesses to marry.\nEmperor Hirohito's daughters lost their titles under the legislation, as did the current crown prince's sister, Sayako, when she married urban planner Yoshiki Kuroda in 2005.\nHer transition from closeted princess to commoner attracted considerable attention. Reports described how she learned to drive and practised shopping independently ahead of her wedding.\nThe couple used her lump-sum payment (reportedly $1.3m; \u00c2\u00a31m) to buy a house and she is now a high priestess of the Ise Grand Shrine.\nSo far Princess Mako's engagement has not been officially announced. But the young woman seems well-equipped for her new status, with two spells of independent living under her belt.\nWhile studying at Tokyo's International Christian University, she spent nine months as an exchange student at Edinburgh University in 2012-13.\nA year later, she lived in halls of residence at Leicester University as she completed her Master's in Art Museum and Gallery Studies. She is currently a researcher at a museum in Tokyo and is studying for her doctorate.\n\"Princess Mako has been the embodiment of an Imperial family member who is close to the public,\" the Yomiuri newspaper said in an editorial. \"Being an amiable person, she will surely build a cheerful home.\"\nBut she will be missed. According to the Asahi newspaper, Princess Mako is currently patron of two organisations, has travelled overseas as a representative of the royal family and has attended important imperial functions.\nHer official duties must now be shared among a dwindling pool of royals.\nAt the moment there are 19 members of the royal family. Seven are unmarried women who must leave when they wed. Eleven (four couples and three widows) are over 50. That leaves Prince Hisahito.\nHe is the youngest of four males in line to the throne. Three of them - Crown Prince Naruhito, his brother Prince Akishino (Fumihito) and Prince Hitachi (Masahito), the current emperor's younger brother, are highly unlikely to have more children.\nThat could potentially leave Prince Hisahito (and whatever family he might go on to have) with sole responsibility for performing official duties and continuing the imperial line.\nAt the moment, a law allowing Emperor Akihito to abdicate is being prepared. In its editorial, the Yomiuri newspaper said the \"creation of female imperial branches should be incorporated\" into the law and discussed as a \"realistic measure for maintaining the number of Imperial family members\".\nBut that is unlikely to go down well with Japanese conservatives.\n\"This is all rooted in the concept of the unbroken male blood line - the notion that what makes Japan special is that it has an imperial line that has been passed down through a male lineage, if you believe the mythical version, ever since the Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC,\" says Professor Ken Ruoff, director of the Centre for Japanese Studies at Portland State University and an expert on the Japanese monarchy.\n\"This is what the nationalists seize upon and they actually will say things like if the male bloodline is broken, then Japan ceases to exist,\" he says. \"Female blood doesn't count.\"\nJapan has had female rulers in the past, though not for about 250 years. In general they were seen as place-holders until the throne reverted to a male member of the family (though there was one case of an empress passing the throne to her daughter to act as regent for a male heir).\nBefore the 1947 legal change, the royal family was much bigger, meaning that if one branch could not produce a male heir there were options elsewhere, but that is no longer the case.\nIn the period before Prince Hisahito was born, when there was no younger-generation heir, there was considerable debate about changing the law to allow women on the throne.\nThe prime minister of the day, Junichiro Koizumi, said he backed the move. But after Prince Hisahito's birth, discussions stalled.\nJapan's current leader, Shinzo Abe, is a more right-wing figure whose speaks often of national pride, tradition and patriotism.\n\"Prime Minister Abe has spent a lot of time talking about his desire to make Japan a society that shines for women but he's got this far-right faction that absolutely opposes changing the law to allow a woman to sit on the throne,\" says Prof Ruoff.\nOne other idea is restoring royal status to branches that lost it in 1947, providing more male heirs.\nMr Abe, the Yomiuri said, backed this in the past. \"It is hard to say the idea has won broad support,\" the paper pointed out.\nBut there is public support for allowing women to inherit the throne. According to a Kyodo News survey in early May, 86% supported allowing a woman emperor and 59% supported allowing an emperor from the female blood-line.\nThis potentially leaves the government out of step with popular sentiment.\nWhatever happens, the future looks bright for Princess Mako. Of more concern, perhaps, is whether a 10-year-old boy has broad enough shoulders to carry the Japanese monarchy onwards.\nAdditional reporting: Chika Nakayama", "summary": "When the Japanese emperor's granddaughter marries law firm employee Kei Komuro next year, her life will undergo a dramatic change.", "id": "39961749", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Japanese Imperial Household Law of 1947, which was enacted after the end of World War II, abolished the Imperial Household Agency and the Privy Council, and reduced the number of members of the Imperial Family from 12 to 10.

At the time, it was the world's fastest estate car.\nBut there is little dispute about how it all started with the first M5, hand built by BMW Motorsport and launched way back in 1984, putting into practice the idea that ordinary saloon cars could be made to behave like supercars.\nBMW has been making M5 models ever since, its latest version competing with Audi's RS6 as well as with the E63 AMG from Mercedes and the XFR from Jaguar.\nThe cars have all been built to be practical road cars, though it is only on a racetrack that you get a feel for their full potential.\nPushing the latest 560hp M5 model at top speed through a series of long and at times rather tight bends on the track, it soon becomes clear that in spite of their discreet facades, these family saloons can rival many of the more macho-looking supercars from the likes of Ferrari, Porsche or McLaren.\n\"The customers want something understated, yet they want power and performance when required,\" according to Brian Cox, product operations manager at BMW UK.\nPowerful high-end models from luxury car companies are often described as \"halo cars\", and all the rivals in the luxury car market have their own versions.\n\"It is very, very important for us,\" says BMW's Mr Cox. \"It's seen as a brand shaper. People want to be part of that club.\"\nIn other words, in spite of their hefty price tags, the luxury carmakers' most powerful cars are not primarily sold to bolster company profits.\nAfter all, they only sell in their hundreds - a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of cars sold by the companies that make them.\nInstead, the muscle cars are essentially poster boys, their job to communicate brand values and image, and thus attract buyers for rather more civilised models.\nThe idea is that customers may feel inspired by the potential of the performance models, then go away and buy similar cars kitted out with relatively small, considerably more frugal and much less powerful engines.\n\"Carmakers have invested millions in loss-making Formula 1 or rally teams, or in high-performance models that help build that 'halo' around the brand,\" says John Lewis, chief executive of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA).\nBut in the end, he reasons, \"common-sense qualities such as running costs and safety will win over many customers\".\nHence, the segment where luxury car companies sell large volumes is governed by a set of performance figures that have little to do with maximum power.\nInstead, fleet and business customers want them to deliver good fuel economy and low carbon dioxide emissions - since these affect how much tax they pay, whether road tax or company car tax.\n\"Most fleet managers will operate a car for three to four years, and they care about two things - the cost of running the car and the tax implications,\" says Mr Lewis.\n\"The key factor in both these equations is fuel efficiency. Fuel is the largest element of running costs, and company car tax is based on CO2 emissions, which are directly related to the amount of fuel a car engine burns.\"\nThus, the way the luxury car companies achieve volume is with the help of frugal, sensible versions of cars that look similar to their high-performance RS, M and AMG cousins.\n\"Fleet and business buyers are already responsible for nearly 60% of new car registrations,\" observes BVRLA's Mr Lewis.\n\"Though for popular 'executive' models, including the Audi A4 and A6, the BMW 3 and 5 series and Mercedes C and E Class, corporate sales could account for an even higher percentage.\"\nSelling more cars than their rivals seems important to many of the carmakers' top executives.\nDieter Zetsche, chief executive of Mercedes' parent company Daimler, for instance, tells BBC News that he thinks it is important for Mercedes to try to reclaim the sales crown which it lost to BMW a few years ago.\nAudi's head of marketing and sales, Peter Schwartzenbauer, is a bit less aggressive when it comes to sales volumes.\n\"We never really aim to be the biggest, but the most successful,\" he tells BBC News.\n\"And this is not necessarily the biggest. It's always a combination of volume, profitability and brand perception. Are you perceived as the leading brand in the premium sector?\"\nRivalry about who delivers the most powerful or the most economic models, or indeed about who sells the most cars, might make for good entertainment.\nBut what really matters to executives of luxury is profits, and as a rule the luxury car companies have become very good at delivering to shareholders.\n\"Luxury carmakers are very good at producing a myriad of slightly tweaked special editions that can help prolong the life of a car model and recoup the huge sums spent developing a replacement,\" says Mr Lewis.\n\"As a basic rule of thumb, larger, more executive models tend to provide carmakers with a higher profit margin, which will also grow with economies of scale.\"", "summary": "To Alex Wotke, horsepower matters, but as a father of three he needs a big car.", "id": "16869432", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe article is about the luxury car market.\nThe article is about the luxury car market.

(Yes, that's right, just like David Cameron and George Osborne.)\nDo you think that - without that EU referendum result - Nicola Sturgeon would now be making legislative plans for indyref2? You do?  Behave yourself.\nLeft in first ministerial peace, without European alarums and excursions, Ms Sturgeon would regard a second independence referendum as a mid-term project. Work on that White Paper, especially the currency. Work on the voters. Govern sensibly and consensually meanwhile. Then try again.\nShe does not now have that option. SNP leaders - Mr Salmond was no different - have to balance the pressure from the party with pragmatism. They hear the cry. \"What do you want? Independence! When do you want it? Now!!\"\nFrankly, they join or lead the chants. But Nicola Sturgeon is also a deeply serious strategist. For the umpteenth time, she does not want to call a referendum. She wants to win one. And she suspects that the immediate environment may not be all that propitious.\nBut she is now constrained. To win support during the 2014 campaign, it was thought sensible to talk up the choice as being generational - or even once in a lifetime.\nTo sustain the support of the SNP's more enthusiastic advocates, it was felt necessary to place caveats on the 2014 defeat for the independence cause.\nIn particular, it was felt appropriate to link those caveats to an issue which had been so dominant in the 2014 campaign itself: that of Scotland's links with the European Union.\nTo be clear, this is a core element, not remotely peripheral or second order. For decades, the SNP pitch has been that Scotland would not solely be quitting the Union of the UK in pursuing independence but joining the Union that is Europe on equal terms. Not leaving, but joining.\nThis was fundamental within the offer to the Scottish people. It offered reassurance. Hence the importance attached by the SNP to the growing debate across these islands, prompted by a fretful Conservative leader, over the EU.\nHence the declaration that overturning Britain's - and thus Scotland's - membership of the EU would result in a \"material change in circumstances\" and possibly indyref2.\nHowever, declaring it as a possibility, forecasting it might happen, does not mean that Nicola Sturgeon wanted such an outcome. To repeat, she did not. She wanted Scotland, Britain, to vote to Remain. She wanted to resume her independence campaigning on her own terms and to her own timescale.\nShe wanted to choose. That choice has now narrowed. Still, Ms Sturgeon does not finally call an independence referendum. She declares that, prior to that, she will examine alternatives to sustain Scotland's links with the EU.\nIn essence, Ms Sturgeon isolates the Scottish vote from the UK outcome. How would she do any other? She believes firmly, viscerally, that Scotland is a nation and should be a state. Just like other states in membership of the EU.\nShe believes firmly, viscerally, that she is now mandated, obliged, to seek to implement that Scottish EU verdict, by whatever means are available.\nBut what might those be? David Cameron has already accepted her demand that Holyrood and the other devolved administrations must be given a role in the EU exit talks. But that would be definitively a devolved role, a subsidiary role. Not leading, but following.\nShe has pressed for direct links between Scotland and EU institutions, without going through the prism of the FCO or the Cabinet Office. But what, in practice, would that mean, other than lobbying and discussion? Would it replicate the current relationship? No.\nMight the EU concede membership to Scotland - or associate membership? Scarcely. The EU operates by member states, several of whom are nervous about sub-state autonomous campaigns within their borders.  For them, UK out means UK out.  The entire UK.\nThere may be warm words. Contented communautaire conversation. But it is membership which, ultimately, counts. And that points to Scotland seeking to join (or rejoin) on her own right, on negotiated terms.  Post independence.\nIt is possible that the people of Scotland will feel so aggrieved by the EU result that they turn towards independence.\nIt is equally possible that they feel that the political environment is already sufficiently chaotic and troubled without adding indyref2 into the mix.\nRemember, too, the nature of the core SNP pitch. It is based upon mature confidence, urging Scotland to take back control of her own affairs.  (Where have I heard that phrase recently?  Ach, it will come back to me.)\nIt is not based upon flight. It is not based upon escaping tyranny or despotism. It is not based upon a rejection of cultural or physical imperialism, as so many other nationalist offers are. It is different.\nStill, it is not always given to political leaders to control the events which shape their decisions.  As one remarkable referendum is digested, stand by, in due course, for another.\nMs Sturgeon, of course, is not remotely alone in finding the overnight results a problem. They are a conundrum for Labour; its understated, limpid appeal for Remain rejected in its English heartlands.\nThey are a challenge for the SNP, seeking to cope with the independence implications. But they are a crisis for the Conservatives whose leader sought to use a plebiscite to unite his team, to unseat UKIP and to cement Britain within the EU. A catastrophic miscalculation on all three counts.\nStill, the best laid schemes and all that sort of thing. As an Ayrshire woman, Ms Sturgeon undoubtedly knows the next Burnsian verse. She may envisage David Cameron bemoaning \"thou art blest compar'd wi' me\".\nBut they both might usefully conclude: \"An' forward, tho' I canna see, I guess and fear.\"", "summary": "It looks \"highly likely\", says Nicola Sturgeon, that there will now be a second referendum upon Scottish independence.", "id": "36625068", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "age David Cameron bemoaning \"thou art blest compar'd wi' me\".\nBut they both might usefully conclude: \"An' forward, tho' I canna see, I guess and fear.\" Please summarize context above: \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley.\"\nThe SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has been forced to rethink her plans for a second independence referendum.", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\n1.

I don't get any off my parents but both sets of Grandparents give me money, and so does one of my Aunts. I never spend it all, and when I do it's hardly anything.\nEmma, Cramlington, Northumberland\nI get \u00a37 a week I think all kids shall have the same amount of pocket each week.\nManjot, London\nI don't get any pocket money because I think we should get things at birthdays and at Christmas.\nCurtis, Gosport\nI think if children want money to spend for themselves, they should get their own jobs, for instance a paper round or something like that. That also helps prepare them with slight work experience for their future lives. The fact that boys on average get more than girls seems unfair because we are just as good as them. I suppose that is always how it has been though, with women being paid less than men sometimes for working just as hard, but, that's life, because the world is not yet a completely fair place.\nCrystal, Wales\nI get \u00a35 per week but everyone else in my class gets more. I think kids should get more pocket money as things are getting more expensive.\nLeo, Salisbury, England\nI can't believe that the average pocket money is \u00a36.50 a week. That is \u00a3350 pound a year. I think that this is much too high. I get \u00a32 pound every week and I am happy with that. Children over the past 100 years are doing less work yet they are getting paid more, it doesn't make sense.\nIzzie, Manchester, England\nI only get 1 pound a week but everyone else has 5 pound a week, but I think it is fair that I only get 1 pound because mum and dad said that I wouldn't get loads of presents on Christmas or birthday because they gave me all their money.\nMelissa, Sandy, England\nI get 5 euro pocket money from my Grandad every weekend. I think it's plenty and a lot of stuff is bought for kids on top of pocket money too like school supplies, clothes etc.\nEmma, Wexford, Ireland\nI get \u00a31 a week apart from the holidays! And every time we turn a year older we get 50p more!\nPhoebe, Ipswich, Suffolk\nI'm 11 and I get 5 pound pocket money I thought that was enough but now hearing the average I would like some more.\nErin, North Shields, England\nI don't get any pocket money but I save up all of my birthday and Christmas money and put it in my bank to save up for the future which I think is fair!\nHannah, Chesire\nMy mum gives me \u00a35 a week but I do a lot more chores than I used to when I didn't get an allowance. I also have \u00a320 a month put into my bank account so I have a lot of money for when I'm older.\nEllen, Merseyside, England\nI get \u00a35 a week for doing 5 jobs every day. I think that is fair as if I don't do one job, my parents take \u00a31 and I still get the rest of my pocket money.\nKatie, Worcestershire\nI have to earn my pocket money! for every job I do I get one pound. I do about 2 jobs on a Saturday and 1 on a Sunday.\nCharlotte, Crowborough\nI don't get pocket money except if I do a job like wash the car or cut the grass.\nIzzy, Lincoln, England\nI get 10 pounds a month to match my age.\nEmily, Burbage, England\nI get \u00a31.00 a week and my younger brother gets 50p. When I was his age, I got 50p as well. I think this is a fair amount. \u00a36 pounds is too much for just a few jobs.\nGrace, Aylesbury, England\nI think I don't get enough pocket money ... I only get \u00a33 and all my friends get more ... it's really unfair :(\nAlicia, Torquay\nI don't get any pocket money, I'm 13 so earn my money from my paper round I do.\nAmy, Burton-upon-Trent, England\nI only get \u00a32.50 and I don't even get it ever week!\nFindlay, Stroud\nI think that I get more than enough pocket money. My allowance has got bigger and that is good but do I really need it when my mum and dad pay for sweets and new clothes when I need it?\nLucy, Northampton\nNo. I get little pocket money a month (1-2 pounds a month)\nSophie, Sheffield\nI don't get any pocket money but i don't really need any.\nJonathan, Braintree, England\nI don't have a weekly allowance so I think children should get more!\nEloise, Bristol, England\nI get 5 pounds a week but I get another 4 pounds for doing my chores.\nMaggie, Salisbury, Wiltshire\nI get \u00a32 a week I think an average of \u00a36.50 is too much and if that is what children are given I think if they are naughty 20p should be taken of that week's pocket money.\nDerin, Hemel Hempstead\nI felt really sad when I heard this, because for the last 5 to 6 years i've done most of the chores in my house and have received no pocket money, not even a penny.\nRyan, Bristol\nI don't get any pocket money but my mum and dad buy some stuff that I want as a substitute to that money. So if I have pocket money of 1 pound I would get something that costs 1 pound.\nAidan, Cambridge\nI get \u00a33 in the holidays but at school if I get 10/10 on my spellings I get \u00a35 but I want to get \u00a34.50 in the holidays.\nHolly, Sheffield\nI have an allowance every month of ten pounds, but since about December I haven't had any.

On Saturday he recorded a 61, his lowest round as a professional.\nIn his last 20 starts, Spieth has won six times, had 11 top-three and 14 top-10 finishes. He would replace Northern Irishman McIlroy at the top of the world rankings if he lifts the Claret Jug on Sunday.\nSpieth, who has never played a competitive round at St Andrews, made light of his late arrival, having only flown in on Monday.\n\"Coming over earlier certainly would have helped,\" said Spieth, who is aiming to join Ben Hogan, who completed the feat in 1953, as the only man to win the Masters, the US Open and the Open in the same year.\n\"But I liked the fact that I could go somewhere, play hard and win a PGA Tour event in preparation.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I have a golf simulator at my house and I played the Old Course with some buddies.

He will play with Faldo and Fowler in the first two rounds.\n\"I won the Scottish Open last year in windy conditions so I can play links golf.

And the most widely supported theory is that dark matter takes the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs.\nProf Gaitskell explains: \"If one considers the Big Bang, 14bn years ago, the Universe was very much hotter than it is today and created an enormous number of particles.\n\"The hypothesis we are working with at the moment is that a WIMP was the relic left-over from the Big Bang, and in fact dominates over the regular material you and I are made of.\"\nThe presence of dark matter was first inferred because of its effect on galaxies like our own.\nAs these celestial systems rotate around their dense centre, all of the regular matter that they contain does not have enough mass to account for the gravity needed to hold everything together.  Really, a spinning galaxy should fly apart.\nInstead, scientists believe that dark matter provides the extra mass, and therefore gravity, needed to hold a galaxy together.\nIt is so pervasive throughout the Universe that researchers believe a vast number of WIMPs are streaming through the Earth every single second. Almost all pass through without a trace.\nHowever, on very rare occasions, it is thought that dark matter particles do bump into regular matter - and it is this weak interaction that scientists are hoping to see.\nThe LUX detector is one of a number of physics experiments based in the Sanford Underground Research Facility that require a \"cosmic quietness\".\nProf Gaitskell says: \"The purpose of the mile of rock above is to deal with cosmic rays. These are high-energy particles generated from outside our Solar System and also by the Sun itself, and these are very penetrating.\n\"If we don't put a mile of rock between us and space, we wouldn't be able to do this experiment.\"\nInside a cavern in the mine, the detector is situated inside a stainless steel tank that is two storeys high.\nThis is filled with about 300,000 litres (70,000 gallons) of ultra-purified water, which means it is free from traces of naturally occurring radioactive elements that could also interfere with the results.\n\"With LUX, we've worked extremely hard to make this the quietest verified place in the world,\" says Prof Gaitskell.\nAt the detector's heart is 370kg (815lb) of liquid xenon. This element has the unusual, but very useful, property of throwing out a flash of light when particles bump into it.\nAnd detecting a series of these bright sparks could mean that dark matter has been found.\nThe LUX detector was first turned on last year for a 90-day test run. No dark matter was seen, but the results concluded that it was the most sensitive experiment of its kind.\nNow, when the experiment is run for 300 days, Prof Gaitskell says these interactions might be detected once a month or every few months.\nThe team would have to see a significant number of interactions -  between five and 10 - to suggest that dark matter has really been glimpsed. The more that are seen, the more statistical confidence there will be.\nHowever, LUX is not the only experiment setting its sights on dark matter.\nWith the Large Hadron Collider, scientists are attempting to create dark matter as they smash particles together, and in space, telescopes are searching for the debris left behind as dark matter particles crash into each other.\nMike Headley, director of the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority, which runs the Sanford laboratory, says a Nobel prize will very probably be in store for the scientists who first detect dark matter.\nHe says: \"There are a handful of experiments located at different underground laboratories around the world that want to be the first ones to stand up and say 'we have discovered it', and so it is very competitive.\"\nFinding dark matter would transform our understanding of the Universe, and usher in a new era in fundamental physics.\nHowever, there is also a chance that it might not be spotted - and the theory of dark matter is wrong.\nDr Jim Dobson, based at the UK's University of Edinburgh and affiliated with University College London, says: \"We are going into unknown territory. We really don't know what we're going to find.\n\"If we search with this experiment and then the next experiment, LUX Zeppelin, which is this much, much bigger version of LUX - if we didn't find anything then there would be a good chance it didn't exist.\nHe adds: \"In some ways, showing that there was no dark matter would be a more interesting result than if there was. But, personally, I would rather we found some.\"\nProf Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist from Durham University, says that many scientists have gambled decades of research on finding dark matter.\nHe adds: \"If I was a betting man, I think LUX is the frontrunner. It has the sensitivity we need.  Now, we just need the data.\n\"If they don't [find it], it means the dark matter is not what we think it is. It would mean I have wasted my whole scientific career - everything I have done is based on the hypothesis that the Universe is made of dark matter. It would mean we had better look for something else.\"\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter", "summary": "The quest to find the most mysterious particles in the Universe is entering a critical phase, scientists say.", "id": "26819792", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe LUX detector is one of a number of physics experiments based in the Sanford Underground Research Facility that require a \"cosmic quietness\".\nProf Gaitskell says: \"The purpose of the mile of rock above is to deal with cosmic rays.

The security was quite inadequate.\n\"We think two people broke in through an emergency exit, took the trophy and walked out again.\"\nPolice at Scotland Yard took control of the investigation but had few leads.\n\"There were two separate descriptions of two clearly different people - a tall person and a short person,\" said Atherton.\n\"The description the police put out was an amalgamation of the two.\"\nIn the meantime, the FA secretly commissioned a replica of the trophy to be made by silversmith George Bird.\nA ransom note for the trophy was received by then FA chairman Joe Mears, signed by someone called Jackson, demanding \u00a315,000.\nOn police advice Mears, who was also chairman of Chelsea, pretended to agree to the deal.\nAn undercover policeman met Jackson - who was really a former soldier called Edward Betchley - in Battersea Park with a suitcase stuffed with newspapers covered with a layer of \u00a35 notes, and Betchley was eventually arrested.\nWith the trophy still missing despite Betchley's arrest, the crucial moment of discovery came on the evening of Sunday, 27 March.\nDave Corbett left his flat in Norwood, south London, to make a phone call and take his dog Pickles for a walk. Little did he know they were about to hit international headlines.\n\"Pickles was running around over by my neighbour's car,\" explained Corbett.\n\"As I was putting the lead on I noticed this package laying there, wrapped just in newspaper but very tightly bound with string.\n\"I tore a bit off the bottom and there was a blank shield, then there were the words Brazil, West Germany and Uruguay printed.\n\"I tore off the other end and it was a lady holding a very shallow dish above her head. I'd seen the pictures of the World Cup in the papers and on TV so my heart started thumping.\"\nCorbett went to his local police station to present the trophy and was initially met with disbelief.\n\"I slammed it on the desk in front of the sergeant and said 'I think I have found the World Cup'.\n\"I remember his words: 'Doesn't look very World Cuppy to me, son'.\nEventually, a detective was summoned and Corbett was taken to Scotland Yard for questioning.\n\"It suddenly dawned on me that I was number one suspect,\" he added.\n\"After an hour or so they ran me back home. When I got back to Norwood there was all the world's press outside.\"\nOnce the police cleared him of any wrongdoing, Corbett - and in particular Pickles - became the subject of the international media spotlight.\nPickles was awarded a medal by the National Canine Defence League and received several other rewards.\nThe collie became a TV star and even appeared in a film with Eric Sykes called The Spy with a Cold Nose.\n\"He won Dog of the Year, Italian Dog of the Year and appeared on television on Blue Peter and Magpie,\" said Corbett, now 76.\n\"He lapped it up and was perfect under the lights.\n\"He was invited to most countries in the world but in those days it was six months' quarantine when you came back.\"\nCorbett, meanwhile, got pay-outs from sponsors and the cup's insurers, which totalled almost \u00a35,000.\nThe pair were invited to a celebratory dinner after England beat West Germany 4-2 following extra time in the final.\n\"We went into the hotel with all these celebrities and Pickles walked over to the lift shaft and did a wee. I felt so embarrassed,\" recalled Corbett.\n\"All the wives of the footballers were there but they weren't invited up to the main reception. I have never met so many angry women.\n\"Afterwards, the England team went out on to a balcony and the street was full of people. We went with them and Bobby Moore picked Pickles up and showed him to the crowd, and there were cheers.\"\nCorbett bought a house in Surrey with his reward money and was a prosecution witness at the trial of Betchley, who was subsequently sent to jail.\nHowever, Pickles did not live much longer to bask in his newfound fame - passing away in 1967.\n\"He was a perfect dog, except he didn't like cats,\" said Corbett.\n\"He was outside with my son and had a choke-chain on when a cat shot across the alleyway. Pickles pulled the boy, he let the lead go and the dog went away.\n\"We were looking everywhere and at the back of garden there was a tree and he was halfway up there. I think he must have broken his neck.\"\nPickles is now buried at the bottom of Corbett's garden in Lingfield.\nAs for the Jules Rimet trophy, it was given to Brazil following their third triumph in the competition in Mexico in 1970.\nHowever, it was stolen from the Brazilian Football Confederation's building when it was on display in 1983 and never recovered. It is believed that it was melted down for gold.\nThe replica, returned to Bird and kept in a box under his bed until his death, was bought at auction by world governing body Fifa in 1997 and is now in the National Football Museum in Manchester.\nHave you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Its authors hope the decision will send a strong enough signal to the Assad regime that it is time to hand over power. That is extremely unlikely. It is hard facts on the ground that count for a regime that has shown determination to fight to the end to stay in power.\nWhile European arms supplies remain for the moment theoretical, the step has stirred an angry reaction - possibly even an escalation - from the Russians. They've said the move jeopardises efforts to convene a peace conference, and that they plan to honour a prior contract to supply Syria with advanced S-300 air defence missiles. Israel sees that as a threat to its own security, and has warned that it \"would know what to do\".\nThe stakes are clearly getting higher. But for the rebels, at least the eventual possibility of carefully-controlled arms deliveries is there, in what looks like being a bloody, long-haul struggle.\nOn Monday, the EU said member states would be able to decide their own policy on sending arms to Syria, after foreign ministers were unable to reach the unanimous decision required to extend the current arms embargo past Saturday.\nHowever, in a declaration announced after 12 hours of talks, it agreed not to \"proceed at this stage with the delivery\" of equipment.\nThe EU's Foreign Affairs Council is to review this position before 1 August, in light of fresh developments to end the conflict including the ongoing US-Russia peace initiative.\nSpeaking to the BBC, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the 1 August date did not represent a deadline, and that the UK could start arming Syrian rebels from now, although it had no active plans to do so.\nA US state department spokesman said the US supported the EU's move.\nThe Syrian foreign ministry said the decision showed the EU's \"obstruction of international efforts to contribute to the achievement of a political settlement\".\nStatistics: IISS\nWhy Russia sells Syria arms\nRussia says the move directly harms the prospects of an international peace conference proposed by Moscow and Washington that would be held next month.\n\"A whole range of actions that have been undertaken, not without the participation and not without the support of our Western partners including the United States and France... are serving to undermine the idea of calling a conference,\" Russian media quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Tuesday.\nRussia has repeatedly blocked efforts to put more pressure on Mr Assad. Along with the US, Moscow has been leading efforts to organise an international peace conference on Syria next month.\nBy Mark MardellNorth America editor\nMr Ryabkov said the contract for the S-300 missile systems had been signed several years ago.\n\"We consider these supplies a stabilising factor and believe such steps will deter some hotheads from considering scenarios that would turn the conflict international with the involvement of outside forces,\" he was quoted as telling journalists, in a coded reference to the use of Nato warplanes in Libya.\nThe S-300 is a highly capable surface-to-air missile system that, as well as targeting aircraft, also has the capacity to engage ballistic missiles.\nIt is broadly comparable to the US Patriot system which has been deployed by Nato to guard Turkish air space against attack from Syria.\nThere had previously been a reluctance to mention the sophisticated weapons system by name, and the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the latest Russian statements could be seen as an escalation.\nSource: Royal United Services Institute\nIndeed, some analysts see confirmation of the arms sale as a \"game changer\" for the Syrian crisis.\nLe Figaro, France: The 27 reached a lame compromise under the threat of the imminent collapse of the sanctions imposed on the regime in Damascus two years ago... The disunion also testifies to the paralysis which Europe's rule of unanimity imposes, at the worst point of the Syrian crisis.\nWirtschaftsBlatt, Austria: The domestically damaged governments of Britain and France are playing with fire. The British-French initiative risks repeating in Syria the mistakes of Afghanistan's Cold War. Cameron and Hollande should not promote chaos in the Middle East by possibly arming terrorists, in order to polish their image at home. Therefore: Geneva convention instead of weapons for an intangible war party.\nEl Mundo, Spain:  The inability to reach a unanimous agreement on this crucial issue of foreign policy has prompted some legal ingenuity: the partial lifting of the arms embargo was signed in an intergovernmental agreement, ie outside EU community legislation.

be able to wander around the city freely like a student.\n\"The town would be the same; what would be different would be my position in life,\" he wrote in a memoir. \"When I thought about things like that, I was overtaken by a strange feeling of uneasiness, and wished that time would stop.\"\nMore than 30 years on, he faces another transition. Emperor Akihito, 83, wants to abdicate, leaving his son to take his place. Special legislation allowing this has just passed parliament, with the abdication expected in late 2018.\nCrown Prince Naruhito, 57, has indicated he is ready and will follow a similar path to his parents, saying he wants to \"stand close to the people\".\nBut the prince, who has in the past appeared to clash with bureaucrats who handle the royal family, has also talked about bringing \"a fresh breeze\" to the monarchy.\nIt is an institution that faces multiple challenges, including succession woes, a shortage of personnel and the mental health struggles of the prince's wife, Crown Princess Masako.\nThe crown prince, while at Oxford, was described in a Foreign Office communique to Mrs Thatcher's aides as a \"personable, although slightly shy young man\".\nIt was just after he returned to Japan in 1986 that he first met his wife.\nFluent in several languages, Masako Owada was an articulate Harvard graduate who had just passed the toughest of exams to become a top-ranked diplomat.\nTheir courtship took time, the delay attributed partly to Ms Owada's concerns about life in the highly conservative royal institution. But in 1993 she agreed to marry him.\nShe later told reporters that she accepted his proposal after he said: \"You might have fears and worries about joining the imperial household. But I will protect you for my entire life.\"\nOnce married, speculation raged over when they would produce a male heir.\nJapan does not allow women to inherit the throne and neither of the prince's siblings had sons. Either a baby boy or a legal change was needed.\nThe royal couple must have felt the pressure. \"If there's too much fuss, I think the stork might get annoyed,\" the prince said pointedly in 1994.\nIn 2001, the couple had a daughter, Princess Aiko, but this did not resolve the succession issue. Soon afterwards, Crown Princess Masako began to disappear from public view, amid speculation about her health.\nAt a press conference in 2004, matters appeared to come to a head. The prince told journalists his wife had \"completely exhausted herself\" trying to adapt to palace life. In unusually strong comments, he accused palace officials of \"moves to negate\" her character and career.\nThe palace then announced that the princess was suffering from an \"adjustment disorder\", now widely assumed to be a reference to depression. For a decade she remained - for the most part - largely out of sight.\nThe succession crisis was alleviated in 2006 when the prince's younger brother and his wife welcomed a baby boy, Prince Hisahito, and in recent years the princess has been more in evidence.\nIn 2014 she attended her first official banquet in 11 years, and a year later travelled to Tonga on an official visit. But the prince said in 2016 that she was \"still subject to ups and downs\".\n\"Some women have been deeply moved by the crown prince's profound protection of Masako - you have to say that he followed through on his promise,\" says Prof Kenneth Ruoff, an expert on the Japanese imperial institution at Portland State University.\n\"But the far-right don't care for him - they find his protection of his wife to be maudlin.\"\nHe says the princess's illness has hampered the couple's ability to define themselves to the public, in contrast to the current imperial couple who had made clear what causes they backed before they assumed the throne.\nWhile Akihito and Empress Michiko have been \"timeless advocates\" of bringing people with disabilities into mainstream society, he says, the crown prince and princess \"haven't really taken on many new causes as a couple\".\nThe prince's known interests include music - he is a keen viola player - and medieval transport. At Oxford he studied water transport on the Thames and has spoken since of his love for the river.\nSince his daughter was born, he has enthused about taking a hands-on role as a father. Internationally, he has embraced water management issues, speaking at several overseas conferences.\nHe has also veered into politics, though the imperial family is, under the constitution, meant to remain above such things.\nIn February 2015, as the world prepared to mark 70 years since the end of World War Two, he said it was \"important to look back in a humble way on the past and pass on correctly the tragic experiences of war\".\nHis comments were interpreted by some as a warning against a revisionist view of history to nationalist politicians.\nIt is this bloc which is seen as the biggest barrier to reforming the monarchy. As well as the succession problem, it is also shrinking because women must leave the royal family when they marry, as Princess Mako is soon expected to do.\nProf Colin Jones of Doshisha University says it is unlikely that the new emperor can play a role in that debate.\n\"The whole point of the current system is to prevent the politicised use of the monarch and so to prevent the monarch doing political things,\" he said.\nBut as emperor, Naruhito will be busy. The post is ceremonial, but there are constitutional roles to perform as well as cultural and public events.\n\"The real issue is one of logistics - if you look at who's available to do those things, it's not a very big pool any more,\" he said.\n\"The thing to watch will be the dynamic between the emperor and his younger brother [who is second in line to the throne and whose son Prince Hisahito is third] - it may be different to what people are accustomed to.\"\nIn his memoir of his time as a student at Oxford, the crown prince comes across as a cheerful and curious individual willing to embrace new experiences - something that will stand him in good stead in the years ahead.\nIsao Tokoro, professor emeritus of Japanese history at Kyoto Sangyo University and an expert invited to give his views to a government-appointed panel on the abdication, says he is well-prepared for the future.\n\"The crown price has been educated to be emperor from the day he was born,\" he said.  \"I feel that it is very important for [him] to play the role and meet the needs of the times as much as possible.\"", "summary": "When Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito was in his last few weeks at Oxford University, he took time to revisit all his favourite places.", "id": "38898500", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

including one urging EU-wide animal welfare guidelines for farm rabbits.\nIn the morning, MEPs will debate new EU gun control regulations announced after the 2015 Paris attacks.\nThe changes include greater restrictions on so-called \"blank-firing\" weapons such as signal guns and replicas.\nHowever plans from the EU Commission for a complete ban on private citizens owning the most dangerous semi-automatic weapons have been watered down.\nAfter this, they will debate new legally-binding EU recycling targets for municipal and packaging waste.\nThe Commission wants at least 65% of municipal waste to be recycled or reused by 2030, with only 10% allowed to be landfilled.\nAt lunchtime MEPs will vote on amendments proposed by the environment committee to up the headline target to 70%.\nHowever the targets will only be agreed when both parties can find agreement with the EU's national governments.\nAfter lunch they are due to debate President Trump's executive order banning federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions.\nThis co-called \"Mexico City policy\" is regularly supported by Republican but rescinded by Democrat presidents - as it had been under Barack Obama.\nIn the evening MEPs will debate new EU rules for food safety inspections, which will be voted on during Wednesday's sitting.\nThey will also discuss what action has been taken on recommendations made last year by the Parliament's special tax investigation committee.\nThe committee was initially set up after the 2014 Luxleaks revelations about favourable corporate tax deals in Luxembourg.\nThey will also debate a report from the Parliament's budgets committee setting out its recommendations for next year's EU budget negotiations.\nThe draft text says that Brexit should be used as an opportunity to address \"long-standing issues\" with the way the EU raises money.\nThe entire morning session will be taken up with debates on the forthcoming Rome summit, and last week's meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.\nAs well as Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni, Commission and European Council chiefs Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk will speak in the debate.\nMr Juncker has already laid out his five options for the EU's future, ranging from preserving the status quo to much deeper political integration.\nHe has said EU leaders must decide which path to take - but noted gnomically this month that he is against \"reducing\" the EU to the concept of a free trade zone.\nAt lunchtime, they are due to vote on a draft motion claiming that a planned toll scheme on German roads could still contravene EU laws.\nThe Commission originally argued that the new road charge discriminates against foreign drivers - but planned court proceedings have been put on hold after Germany came to an agreement on the scheme with the EU executive last year.\nIn the afternoon the main debate will be on new EU rules requiring all but the smallest companies to carry out due diligence for imports of \"conflict minerals\".\nForcing firms to adhere to international monitoring standards aims to prevent money from the sale of the minerals falling into the hands of armed groups.\nThe checks will need to be undertaken by importers of tin, tungsten, gold and tantalum - a metal often used in mobile phones.\nA deal reached on the rules towards the end of last year will only see exemptions granted for small importers like dentists and jewellers.\nIt marks a significant victory for MEPs, who pushed to strengthen the original plans tabled by the Commission for largely voluntary monitoring.\nThis will be followed by a debate on Parliament's rules for granting funding to political groups.\nSome MEPs are pushing for a change to the procedure after an alliance of far-right parties received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600,000 in EU grants last year.\nIn the evening they will debate what the EU's strategy should be towards the Arctic region, and progress on Montenegro's EU accession talks.\nA relatively quiet day kicks off with a debate on new measures for collecting and managing data on fisheries stocks.\nThe changes are meant to simplify the system as part of a wider overhaul of the EU's common fisheries policy proposed in 2013.\nAs per tradition, before the day's voting session they will debate three topical human rights motions.\nThis month's motions focus on the trials of four Christians in Sudan, prisoners in Ukraine and a senator arrested in the Philippines.\nThe motions will be put to a vote after 11.00 BST, along with the new reporting regulations for conflict minerals.\nPlease note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.\nA guide to how the European Parliament's plenary sessions can be found here.", "summary": "The European Parliament meets for a plenary sitting this week ahead of the EU's birthday bash later this month.", "id": "39235691", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe European Parliament is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union (EU).

It's not,\" defence lawyer Barry Roux said.\nAddressing the judge, he added: \"Their problem is they don't like your factual finding. They don't appreciate that. You absolutely, correctly applied the law.\"\nCorrespondents say it is common in South Africa for the same judge to hear an appeal against their own verdicts.\nJudges often grant the request because they are confident they applied the law correctly and their judgement will stand up to scrutiny.\nIn court - By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Pretoria\nIt may seem like unnecessary legal wrangling but the state believes it has a strong case and wants the Supreme Court of Appeal to help deliver justice for Reeva Steenkamp.\nThe law makes provision for prosecutors to appeal on a matter of law but not on a factual finding.\nIf the state's attempt fails, Pistorius could be eligible for parole and house arrest after serving 10 months. This is a prospect prosecutor Gerrie Nel is desperate to avoid.\nHe wants to undo what he has called a \"grossly inappropriate\" sentence and believes, if given the chance, a higher court would rule in his favour.\nSouth African criminal lawyer Martin Hood told AFP news agency that he expected Judge Masipa to agree to the prosecution's request because there was \"just too much controversy about the judgement\".\n\"It doesn't matter what the outcome of the appeal is.

It was a dramatic way of announcing himself as a new kind of Conservative - one who cared about the environment and didn't mind enduring freezing temperatures without a hat to prove it (predecessor William Hague had never recovered from being pictured with a baseball cap in the early days of his leadership so headgear was banned on Mr Cameron's Arctic trip).\nHe never promised us a rose garden. But that's what we got when David Cameron stunned Westminster by making a \"big, open and comprehensive\" offer to the Liberal Democrats on the morning after a May 2010 general election that nobody won. The bloom-filled Downing Street garden was the venue for the first press conference with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg after four days of frantic deal-making and intrigue. The body language, as Mr Cameron joshed with Mr Clegg over the insults they had hurled at each other in the past, was good. Britain didn't do coalitions - it had never been tried since World War Two - but this looked like it might just work. Despite the doubters it did last all the way to the 2015 election.\n11 years\nas Tory leader\n6 years\nas Prime Minister\n43  when he became PM - the youngest for more than 200 years\n1st leader of a coalition government since WWII\n3 referendums held under his premiership\n12 Conservative majority in 2015 - the first for 23 years\nDavid Cameron's ability to look and sound prime ministerial when the occasion demanded it was one of his biggest strengths. It was never more evident than during his Commons statement on the Bloody Sunday inquiry in June 2010, which drew praise from across the political spectrum. He described the findings of the Saville Report into the shooting dead of 13 marchers on 30 January 1972 in Londonderry as \"shocking\" - an action that was \"unjustified\" and \"unjustifiable\", and for which he was \"deeply sorry\". His statement in 2012 on Hillsborough and his reaction after the April 2016 inquest verdicts earned similar plaudits.\nLibya was David Cameron's first, and in terms of its long-lasting impact arguably most disastrous, foreign policy intervention. He had pushed a reluctant US President Barack Obama to come to the aid of rebel fighters attempting to topple Colonel Gaddafi and help impose a no-fly zone over Libya. Mr Cameron  was greeted as a hero when he visited Libya with then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in September 2011, after Gaddafi had been ousted. He pledged not to allow Libya to turn into another Iraq, but critics say that is exactly what happened, as it it rapidly descended into violence.\nIt was one of David Cameron's proudest achievements as prime minister. On 21 May, 2013, MPs voted to allow same-sex couples in England and Wales, who could already hold civil ceremonies, to marry. For Mr Cameron it sent a powerful signal of the kind of tolerant, inclusive country he said he wanted Britain to be - but it cost him dear in terms of lost support from grassroots Conservatives, many of whom could not accept it.\nAfter years of rejecting calls from his own MPs for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, Mr Cameron dramatically announced, in a speech at financial wire service Bloomberg in January 2013, that he would hold one if he won the next election, after first renegotiating the UK's membership of the 28-nation bloc. It was the biggest gamble of his political career, made against the backdrop of Eurosceptic rebels in the Tory party demanding a vote and evidence that traditional Conservative voters were heading to the UK Independence Party. As they say in politics,  it kicked the can down the road and arguably helped him win the 2015 election. But it was also the vote that ended his career.\nIn August 2013, David Cameron became the first prime minister in more than 100 years to lose a Commons vote on military action. It seemed to be a devastating blow to his authority. He had failed to persuade enough MPs, including many on his own side, that Britain should take part in air strikes against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \"I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons,\" he said minutes after the result was announced.\nMr Cameron held more referendums than any British prime minister. He easily won the first one in 2011, opposing his deputy PM's bid to change Britain's voting system, but the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum provoked the biggest panic of his first term in office. As polling day approached, he was forced to cancel Prime Minister's Questions and rush north of the border in an effort to save the Union, with an impassioned speech at the HQ of Scottish Widows in Edinburgh, when a poll suggested the Yes campaign would win. He was later forced to issue an apology to the Queen, after he was overheard telling New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg Her Majesty had \"purred down the line\" when he informed her that Scotland had rejected independence.\nIn the space of two minutes everything changed. The BBC exit poll predicting the Conservatives would be close to gaining a majority of seats stunned everybody, including, we must assume, David Cameron, who the polls had been suggesting could lose to Labour or have to form another coalition with the Lib Dems. Mr Cameron had been criticised for running a negative, fear-based campaign, but it had succeeded. The pledge to hold an EU referendum if elected also helped gain votes. He formed the first majority Conservative government since 1992 - a personal triumph that would prove to be remarkably short-lived.\nMr Cameron had staked everything on his ability to persuade the country to vote to remain in the EU, before realising at a late stage in the campaign that it might not be enough. His tone grew more desperate as he contemplated going down in history as the PM who took Britain out of the EU. Despite insisting he would stay on as PM whatever the result, he announced his departure in an emotional statement in Downing Street within hours of the result becoming clear, with wife Samantha at his side.", "summary": "David Cameron is stepping down after six years as Britain's prime minister and nearly 11 years as Conservative leader - here are 10 key moments", "id": "36774274", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nDavid Cameron's ability to look and sound prime ministerial when the occasion demanded it was one of his biggest strengths.

There can be cases where it is doubtful, maybe it was permissible to go to war, but Iraq was, in my view, not one of those.\"\nHe said he agreed with France and Russia, who argued that further UN authorisation was needed for military action.\n\"It was clear that a second resolution was required,\" he said.\nIn the run-up to war, he said the US government was \"high on\" the idea of pre-emptive military action as a solution to international crises.\n\"They thought they could get away with it and therefore it was desirable to do so.\"\nWhile he believed Iraq \"unilaterally\" destroyed its weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War, Dr Blix said he never \"excluded\" the prospect that it had begun to revive some form of chemical and biological capabilities.\nBy Peter BilesBBC world affairs correspondent at the inquiry\nAt the age of 82, Hans Blix retains considerable stamina.\nHe came out of retirement a decade ago to lead the ultimately futile search for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\nOn Tuesday, he gave evidence to the Iraq inquiry for three hours, before heading off to conduct a round of TV interviews.\nThe inquiry panel wanted to know what this mild-mannered former Swedish diplomat had made of Saddam Hussein's behaviour.\n\"I never met him\", replied Dr Blix, \"but I saw him as someone who wanted to be like Emperor Nebuchadnezzar.... utterly ruthless.... and he misjudged it at the end\".\nDr Blix trod a neutral path during the build-up to the Iraq conflict, but, in his evidence, he repeated much of what he has said on different occasions since 2003.\nCrucially, he had serious doubts about the intelligence that lay behind the move to go to war.\nIn September 2002, he said he told Tony Blair privately that he believed Iraq \"retained\" some WMD, noting CIA reports that Iraq may hold some anthrax.\nHowever, he said he began to become suspicious of US intelligence on Iraq following claims in late 2002 that Iraq had purchased raw uranium from Niger, which he always said he thought was flawed.\nSince the war, Dr Blix has accused the UK and US of \"over-interpreting\" intelligence on weapons to bolster the case for war but he said the government's controversial September 2002 dossier on Iraqi weapons seemed \"plausible\" at the time.\nHe stressed that Tony Blair never put any \"pressure\" on him over his search for weapons in Iraq and did not question that the prime minister and President Bush believed in \"good faith\" that Iraq was a serious threat.\n\"I certainly felt that he [Tony Blair] was absolutely sincere in his belief.\n\"What I question was the good judgement, particularly of President Bush but also in Tony Blair's judgement.\"\nCritics of the war believe that had inspectors been allowed to continue their work they would have proved beyond doubt that Iraq did not have active weapons of mass destruction capability - as was discovered after the invasion.\nDr Blix said the military momentum towards the invasion - which he said was \"almost unstoppable\" by early March - did not \"permit\" more inspections and the UK was a \"prisoner on this train\".\nIf he had been able to conduct more inspections, he said he believed they would have begun to \"undermine\" US-UK intelligence on Iraq's alleged weapons and made the basis for the invasion harder.\nThe US and UK have always maintained that Saddam Hussein failed to co-operate fully with the inspections process and was continuing to breach UN disarmament resolutions dating back to 1991.\nIn his evidence in January, former foreign secretary Jack Straw said the regime had only started complying in the final period before the invasion \"because a very large military force was at their gates\".\nThe inquiry, headed by Sir John Chilcot, is coming towards the end of its public hearings, with a report expected to be published around the end of the year.", "summary": "The UN's former chief weapons inspector Hans Blix has said it is his \"firm view\" that the Iraq war was illegal.", "id": "10770239", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe inquiry, headed by Sir John Chilcot, is coming towards the end of its public hearings, with a report expected to be published around the end of the year.\nThe inquiry, headed by Sir John Chilcot, is coming towards the end of its public hearings, with a report expected to be published around the end of the year.

And it has been a pure and fairly straightforward celebration of the last 50 years of pop, with Elgar and Russell Brand thrown in.\nUnlike the opening ceremony, it doesn't have to set any scene or make any statement for a coming event. So why not roll out some of the top acts - from Annie Lennox to One Direction, Spices added.\nAll in the presence of a mosh pit full of Olympian athletes and the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, who have enjoyed these Games as much as the next sports fan.\nWorrying about the Olympics being over? That's for another time.\nFinale shows bright side of life\nPrince Harry represented the Queen at the ceremony, which took place on top of a stage in the shape of a union jack and saw a volunteer cast of 3,500.\nThe show saw the Spice Girls re-form to sing Spice Up Your Life from the top of five London taxis, and a surprise performance from Take That, who sang their hit Rule the World. It had been thought they would not appear because Gary Barlow was mourning the loss of his daughter who was delivered stillborn last Saturday.\nArtistic Director Kim Gavin also brought together household names, including George Michael, Jessie J, Emeli Sande, Madness, the Pet Shop Boys, One Direction, Ray Davies and Liam Gallagher, as the best of British music went on show to the world.\nDuring the ceremonial part of the show, the Olympic flag was waved aloft by London Mayor Boris Johnson and passed by Mr Rogge into the hands of the Mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes.\nThe Brazilian national anthem rang out and the stadium was transformed into the green and yellow colours of Brazil's flag.\nLondon 2012 chairman Lord Coe told the audience: \"Today sees the closing of a wonderful Games in a wonderful city.\n\"We lit the flame and lit up the world.\"\nThe official handover also saw a celebration of Rio's mix of cultures, music and dance, bringing a carnival atmosphere to the proceedings.\nEarlier, there was a riot of colour as the athletes entered the stadium, with four-time Olympic gold medallist sailor Ben Ainslie carrying the British flag and leading out Team GB.\nThe smiling athletes filled each section of the floor of the stadium, to the sound of Elbow playing their atmospheric hit, One Day Like This.\nAs is traditional during the closing ceremony, the final medals of the 2012 Olympics were handed out. On this occasion they went to the athletes in the men's marathon, which was won by Uganda's Stephen Kiprotich.\nThe 70,000 Games Maker volunteers were also thanked for their hard work during the 16 days of competition.\nHome-grown fashion was celebrated with appearances from models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, both wearing the creations of the late Alexander McQueen, while British eccentricity also featured, with comedian Russell Brand singing the Beatles' I am the Walrus from the top of a psychedelic bus.\nComedian Eric Idle drew much laughter when he performed a typically quirky version of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, and Muse rocked the stadium with the official anthem of the Games, Survival.\nThe Games ended with the US topping the final medal table with 46 golds, followed by China with 38 golds. GB came third with 29 golds - their best tally since 1908.\nThe Queen earlier said Team GB's \"outstanding\" performance had \"inspired\" the country.\nThe last day saw a final - and 29th gold - for Team GB, with boxer Anthony Joshua winning his super-heavyweight bout.\nIn all, 44 world records have been set during London 2012, and 117 Olympic records broken.\nAmong those to have set new world bests included Kenyan David Rudisha in the men's 800m and the Jamaican sprint relay team, which included 100m and 200m gold medallist Usain Bolt.\nUS swimmer Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian in history while cyclist Sir Chris Hoy's two gold medals meant he became the most successful British Olympian of all time.\nEarlier, US President Barack Obama telephoned Prime Minister David Cameron to offer his congratulations for a \"brilliant\" London Olympics, Downing Street said.\nOn Sunday, crowds also packed London's Hyde Park to watch the sporting action on big screens and enjoy a farewell concert headlined by Blur.\nThe Paralympics is set to start on 29 August, with the revamped 560-acre (227-hectare) Olympic Park site - to be known as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - then set to reopen from the first anniversary of the opening of the Games, on 27 July 2013.", "summary": "The London 2012 Olympics have ended with a spectacular musical closing ceremony and the official handover to the next host city, Rio de Janeiro.", "id": "19236754", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe three-hour show featured some of the biggest names of British pop from decades past, including the Spice Girls, George Michael and Elbow.

The checkpoint is being overseen by Russia's internal security service, the FSB.\nApart from the road, and the single railway line, Sochi is effectively cut off from the outside world.\nIt is a long coastal strip bordered by the Caucasus Mountains to the north-east and the Black Sea to the south-west.\nThe border crossing to Abkhazia - a region of Georgia which has declared independence - is shut to vehicles for the duration of the Games.\nIn the sea off the Olympic Park we spotted high-speed naval boats and a mysterious ship bristling with communications masts. Named \"Seliger\", it was commissioned in December 2012 and was described at the time as a \"deep-sea research vessel\".\nThe mountains are being guarded by the Russian army.\nThe Olympics are split between the \"coastal cluster\" of ice rinks by the Black Sea in the Sochi suburb of Adler, and the \"mountain cluster\" of skiing and sliding events at Krasnaya Polyana.\nAll along the road between the two we saw \"hides\" in the woods, concealing soldiers in white Arctic suits.\nOn some sections of the road the \"hides\" are placed every few hundred metres - usually a small white tent with a green camouflaged sentry tent beside it.\nThe army have taken over the old road up the valley from where they can look down on the new roads and railway line built for the Olympics.\nThe railway stations and airports have visibly higher security too.\nThese Games will have more obvious security than any previous winter or summer Olympics.\n\"President Putin has said that 40,000 people from our police and armed services will be involved in securing the games,\" Alexander Zhukov, the head of Russia's Olympic committee explained.\n\"At the same time we are also doing everything to ensure the maximum security during the Games doesn't bother the spectators, the athletes, the tourists - so that it doesn't interfere with the sporting party,\" he said.\n\"In Sochi we are doing everything to ensure a safe Games but at the same time making sure this does not affect the spirit.\"\nNext to the brand-new power station overlooking the Olympic Park we found a sizeable anti-aircraft battery, with two radar dishes and a cluster of vehicles loaded with missiles. But Alexander Zhukov insisted it was nothing unusual.\n\"I have attended a few Olympic Games, and I know that organisers always pay special attention to security. In London they even put surface-to-air missiles on roofs,\" he said.\n\"I think all of these measures are necessary to ensure safety during a major event like the Olympic Games. In Sochi a huge amount of attention has been paid to it.\"\nThe Olympic Park has its own CCTV control room with police officers monitoring hundreds of security cameras.\nThere is a control room for the whole city too, with another 1,400 cameras being checked day and night.\nThe threat is obvious.\nThe Games are being staged only a few hundred miles from the most violent insurgency in Europe.\nThe Russian Caucasus republics of Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia are the focus of a revolt by militant Islamists who use suicide bombings, assassinations, and attacks on the army and police in their struggle to build an Islamic Caliphate in the Caucasus.\nBritish security officials wrote that: \"Attacks are very likely to occur in Russia in the run up to or during the Games. They are occurring irrespective of the event, particularly in the Dagestan region.\n\"Imarat Kavkaz (the Caucasus Emirate) is the main threat and has repeatedly expressed a desire to target the Games. In July 2013\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Doku Umarov (one of the leaders of the Caucasus Emirate) called for followers to do what was necessary to disrupt them.\"\nThat thesis is supported by Professor Mark Galeotti of New York University, and an expert on Russian security.\n\"I think it's almost guaranteed that there will be attacks elsewhere. There may even be attacks on Sochi, particularly probing the outer rim of the security zone,\" Mark Galeotti warned.\n\"Because let's face it, if a suicide bomber drives a car into a checkpoint and explodes it - even though that's no real threat to the athletes or spectators - it still gets the headlines on Sochi.\"\nIn Volgograd, one of the main cities in southern Russia, 34 people died in December in two suicide bomb attacks on successive days - at the main railway station and on a trolley bus.\nThe attacks were claimed - in a suicide video - by two men who said they were from Vilayat Dagestan, a group which is part of the wider Imarat Kavkaz.\nThey warned of further attacks including on Sochi itself.\nDoku Umarov has called for his followers to do everything they can to disrupt what he called \"these Satanic Games\".\nThe attacks immediately re-awakened the security concerns surrounding the Winter Olympics.\n\"At the moment the rebels are winning,\" Professor Galeotti said.\n\"The rebels are getting everyone talking about security, and therefore they're turning the Games from being what Putin meant them to be - a triumph for Russia - into a story about Russian insecurity and Russian failings.\"\nBritish security officials, however, do not believe it will be so easy to attack Sochi itself.\n\"Volgograd shows a capability against that city but this can't translate to Sochi where Russian military operations and greater distance from Dagestan will pose a greater challenge,\" their assessment reads.\nAlexei Navalny - the opposition leader who is one of President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics - also thinks it is unlikely that Sochi itself will be attacked.\n\"I think that the security measures which are in place will guarantee security in Sochi,\" he said. \"Of course this region isn't very stable, but in the end I'm sure that the Russian state is capable of ensuring security in the Olympic zone.\n\"When people hear Caucasus they think that Chechnya and Sochi are five kilometres apart. That's not the case - there's a large distance between them.

You can do that in a number of ways.\n\"We want to work with business on this and that's why we'll be consulting later this year on the various ways in which we can do it to find a model that works,\" she said.\nDid the PM arrive at the CBI conference with an olive branch or just another stick? A little bit of both.\nBusiness groups have been wary of Theresa May ever since her blistering attack on the massive pay differentials, tax avoidance and treatment of workers she identified in some corners of British business.\nToday, she offered a more conciliatory tone. As well as weakening her commitment to put workers on company boards, saying only their voice should be represented - she insisted her agenda was unequivocally pro-business.\nHowever, there was no escaping the big question as spelled out by the CBI's President, Paul Dreschler: \"What happens the day after we leave the EU? Government has a responsibility to keep uncertainty to a minimum. We understand, in negotiations, the need for discretion, we're not asking for a running commentary but we are looking for clarity and above all a plan.\"\nBusiness folk were pleased to hear her say, when questioned, that she understood their fears over a potential cliff edge of trading and regulatory uncertainty the day after Britain leaves the EU but weren't so pleased she declined to reassure them with details of her plan.\nIf business leaders were hoping to be treated to the same fireside chat that seemed to comfort the boss of Nissan, they would have left disappointed.\n\u00c2\u00a32bn of new money for research and development was welcomed and business leaders seemed to accept the essential premise of the grand bargain she is offering - the government invests to boost productivity and cut corporation tax in exchange for help in tackling the worst excesses of capitalism.\n'Clear promise'\nHowever, trade unions said they were disappointed by Mrs May's remarks.\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Theresa May made a clear promise to have workers represented on company boards. The proposals in her speech do not deliver on this.\n\"This is not the way to show that you want to govern for ordinary working people.\"\nBut CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said \"different approaches will work for different businesses\" on employee engagement.\n\"A starting point is firms being able to outline and explain what approach they are taking - whether that's employees on boards, employee committees, dedicated representatives, or other models that genuinely address the issue.\"\nWhat May did and didn't say at CBI\nWhat is the Autumn Statement?\nA difficult trick to pull off\nViews from UK business\nFinancial upheaval ahead for families\nMrs May also promised to boost productivity and cut corporation tax in exchange for help from businesses in tackling issues such as executive pay and shareholder accountability.\n\"Just as the government must open its mind to a new approach, so the business community must too,\" she said.\nThe promises made by the prime minister include a \"patient capital review\" to help firms secure long-term investment. The review will be chaired by Sir Damon Buffini, the former head of private equity group Permira.\nMrs May also said the government would review the support given to innovative firms through the tax system \"because my aim is not simply for the UK to have the lowest corporate tax rate in the G20, but also one that is profoundly pro-innovation.\"\nCorporation tax is already due to fall from its current 20% rate to 17% by 2020.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the conference later in the day criticising the government's \"shambolic\"  approach to Brexit which he said was hampering business's ability to plan. He set out Labour's approach to working with business, which he said would be characterised by \"good intervention\".\nHe said Labour's policies would involve \"some increase in corporation tax\" and said the suggestion that the UK should aim to reduce corporation tax to 15% or below was \"reckless short-term grandstanding.\"\nHe called for more investment in housing, research and development and infrastructure, a higher minimum wage and measures to prevent undercutting of workers' pay and conditions.", "summary": "Theresa May has tried to reassure businesses fearing a sudden change in rules once the UK leaves the EU.", "id": "38044015", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe prime minister also promised to review the tax system to make it \"profoundly pro-innovation\".\nShe said the government would also review the support given to innovative firms through the tax system \"because my aim is not simply for the UK to have the lowest corporate tax rate in the G20, but also one that is profoundly pro-innovation.\"\nCorporation tax is already due to fall from its current 20% rate", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe CBI is a lobby group for businesses in the UK.\nThe CBI is a lobby group for businesses in the UK.

And although there is plenty of evidence to suggest the Universe is awash with these ripples, so far no actual detection has been made \u2013 either here on Earth or in space.\nIt's not for want of trying, but the signal is expected to be very faint, even from the biggest sources.\n\"Gravitational waves are essentially the mechanism that carries the force of gravity through the Universe,\" explained Esa's Lisa Pathfinder project scientist, Dr Paul McNamara.\n\"They are produced by very large, violent events in the Universe \u2013 things like galaxies merging, where super-massive black holes in those galaxies come together. Supernovae, pulsars - any violent event where mass is moving. But for the space-based detectors, we're really looking at the very big things in the Universe \u2013 the super-massive; the million solar mass objects.\"\nConfirmation of the waves' existence and their subsequent routine observation would open up a new paradigm in astronomy.\nIt is one that would no longer depend on traditional light telescopes to look at and understand phenomena on the sky.\n\"The overwhelming part of the Universe is dark and will never be visible with electromagnetic radiation, but for all we know everything in the Universe interacts via gravity. So, \u2018listening\u2019 to gravity seems like the obvious thing to do to learn about the dark side of the cosmos,\" said Prof Karsten Danzmann, the co-principal investigator on Lisa Pathfinder.\nA new paradigm in the study of the Universe\nGravitational waves should propagate at the speed of light, alternately stretching and squeezing space.\nAnd despite their delicate nature, their presence ought still to be apparent to an ultra-stable, super-fine measurement system.\nIt is worth re-stating: Pathfinder's job is not to make a detection, merely to demonstrate the required metrology.\nTo do this, it will try to put two small gold-platinum blocks into a near-perfect free-fall and then track their relative movement using lasers.\nThe intention is to get these \"test masses\" following a \"straight line\" that is defined only by gravity.\nThat's easier said that done because there are plenty of forces that want to push these blocks off course.\nThere's the pressure of sunlight, the influence of magnetic fields, and the distortions introduced by changing temperatures. The spacecraft\u2019s own gravity will also exert a slight tug on the blocks.\n\"There are phenomena like collisional molecules,\" explained Pathfinder\u2019s other co-PI, Prof Stefano Vitale.\n\"Despite being under high vacuum, there are still residual molecules and they can hit the test masses. They\u2019re very small but they communicate a force, and we are after forces that are less than the weight of a bacterium,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We have a performance budget book with many, many entries, but the leading ones number 10; and we think now that after all we have tested, experimented and mastered in the lab - we think we can control these forces, but obviously nothing can substitute for a final test on orbit.\"\nThe experiment has been designed such that disturbances to the blocks as small as just a few picometres should be noticed. One picometre is a fraction of the width of an atom.\nA system for ultra-precise measurement\nThis level of sensitivity has long been achieved in Earth-bound set-ups, but never in space.\nAnd if scientists want to hunt the ripple signals associated with the mergers of super-massive black holes \u2013 and their low frequency means they can only be detected in space \u2013 then picometre sensitivity is what Lisa Pathfinder must achieve.\nIf the satellite can successfully showcase this off-world capability, it will initiate the next step: an operational gravitational-wave observatory.\nEsa has essentially already committed itself to such a venture.\nThe space agency has said that the billion-euro mission it will fly in 2030 will investigate the \"gravitational Universe\". There will be a call for science proposals that fit with this theme, but in truth there is really only one contender. Certainly, only one contender will come forward with technology that has already been de-risked to the tune of 430 million euros (and that is just the cost to Esa of Lisa Pathfinder; it does not include other sums spent in the agency\u2019s member states).\nThe more significant question centres on what sort of space-borne gravitational-wave observatory should be flown.\nThe basic architecture calls for lasers to measure picometre changes in the positions of platinum-gold blocks that are separated not by 38cm, as in Pathfinder, but by millions of km. This involves putting the blocks in different spacecraft units and flying them in formation.\nIn terms of the best science, the ideal scenario would be to have a trio of spacecraft with the lasers running between each of them. A three-armed laser interferometer.\nBut when this architecture was proposed a few years ago, the cost frightened the Americans who at that stage were going to be partners on the project \u2013 and they pulled out.\nA simpler, Europe-only version was then devised that had just two laser arms. But its perceived inferior performance meant that it failed to win the support of the scientific community.\nSo now the mission's chief proponents are pushing to go back to three arms, and an advisory panel convened by Esa looks set also to endorse such a configuration.\nOf course, the additional arm raises the price, adding perhaps another 100 million euros to the overall budget.\nIf the Americans came back in, it would sort that issue straightaway. But Europe will not be held hostage again by the US, and it will start from the premise that it will have to pick up the full cost of any chosen architecture.\n\"It's quite a long way into the future, so that really makes it a cash-flow problem. But I'm sure we could find a way,\" said Esa science chief Prof Alvaro Gimenez.\nAssuming nothing goes horribly wrong with the Lisa Pathfinder demonstration, industry will probably be asked in 2017 to begin to spec the observatory with definition studies.

Most misuse drink or drugs - or both.\nNicholas Crichton recently retired after many years as a judge in the family court.\nHe said: \"The work of the family courts for years has been removing the second, the third, the fourth child from the same mother. Not infrequently the sixth, the seventh, the eight.\n\"In one case I've removed the 14th and I know two judges that have removed the 15th child from the same mother.\"\nAccording to the research, half the women involved are 24 or below at the time of the first care application, with the youngest being 14. Their babies are often removed quickly, at birth or soon afterwards.\nDr Karen Broadhurst of the University of Manchester, lead author of the research, told the BBC that \"in approximately 42% of cases, infants were subject to care proceedings within a month of their birth, which is an important finding\".\n\"We know that in 70% of cases infants were subject to proceedings within the first year of their life, which obviously leaves the mother with very little time to turn her life around.\"\nShe also said the gaps between care proceedings were short for these mothers.\n\"We think there is an average of 17 months between the first time a mum appears in court with an infant and the second time she appears in court with another infant.\n\"It suggests to us there's a very short interval between pregnancies, which gives mums very little time to engage in their own rehab.\"\nDr Broadhurst argued that the research demonstrates the need for family courts to change their approach, to help these women change their behaviour.\n\"We also need to get better at ensuring those young parents can access the treatment that's recommended within the family court.\"\nOne pioneering new approach is that of the Strengthening Families Project, funded by Salford Council.\nA community midwife, Wendy Warrington, and a specialist social worker, Elly Siddall, run workshops for pregnant women who risk losing their new baby, because they or their partner have already had at least one child taken into care.\nTheir approach is direct and hard-hitting. One Thursday afternoon, in a health centre in Eccles, Ms Warrington told a group of mothers-to-be about the side effects of drinking during pregnancy.\n\"They're born early, there's an increased risk of stillbirth,\" she said, pulling up graphic images on her whiteboard. \"There's definitely abnormal brain development. Risk of loss of limbs, fingers, toes.\"\nThe women were visibly shocked. More disturbing images followed, of babies damaged by drug-taking mothers. One woman broke down in tears, worried she had already hurt her child through drinking.\nThe project has been running for two-and-a-half years and early results are promising. More mothers are succeeding in keeping their babies at home. For Salford Council, that is money saved - foster care is expensive. For the mothers who keep their babies, it is a new chance.\nOne young woman, in her early 20s, whose two eldest children had been adopted as babies, said: \"It was just a mess. I had two children taken into care, though not of my own fault, through my past partner, my oldest little girl's dad. He battered her when she was three-and-a-half months old.\"\nShe became pregnant again - and the new baby was taken away from the hospital very soon after birth by Salford Children's Services. She was devastated, suffered from postnatal depression, and missed her two babies.\nLike many women in this situation, she wanted to have another child as soon as possible. For her third pregnancy, however, she came to the Strengthening Families project.\nShe found it supportive and honest, saying: \"They will tell you straight and that is what people need.\"\nMs Warrington and Ms Siddall also provide informal support to the mothers in the project, regularly calling them, sometimes visiting at home, to make sure they're looking after themselves and their unborn child. The team help write reports for the Family Court.\nThis project has been going for two-and-a-half years, whereas the pioneering Family Drug and Alcohol Court (FDAC) set up by Mr Crichton in central London has been running since 2008.\nLast month the Nuffield Foundation found FDAC had helped 35% of mothers become reunited with their children, compared with 19% in the ordinary family courts.\nThe FDAC has its own team of experts, doctors, therapists and expert social workers from the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust and the children's charity Coram.\nMost parents in care cases have problems with drugs or alcohol. The FDAC's team helps them kick their addictions and, like the Strengthening Families Project, teaches them how to be better parents.\nIt is funded by London local authorities who, like Salford, recognised the benefits to their budgets of keeping children out of care, even though the cost of this court is higher than that of the ordinary family court.\nOne other FDAC has been opened in Gloucester, another is planned, but so far expansion has been slow.\nThis spring the president of the family court, Sir James Munby, praised the court and said: \"FDAC is - it must be - a vital component in the new family court.\" He has said there should be an FDAC in every family court in England.\nNicholas Crichton believes the new research underlines the need for the expansion of projects which help parents break the destructive cycle.\n\"The emotional cost to those families, and to their children, is immense but the financial cost to the taxpayer is immense as well and we really have to find a different way of dealing with these cases.\"\nSanchia Berg's report will be on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 June.", "summary": "Thousands of mothers over the past seven years have had successive children removed by family courts in England, the BBC has learned.", "id": "27943591", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The researchers found that 7,143 mothers were involved in repeat care cases - affecting 22,790 children.\nResearchers found children were taken away from their parents by local authorities in more than 90% of cases.\nThe research was carried out by the Universities of Brunel and Manchester and funded by the Nuffield Foundation.\nIt backs up what judges have observed in their own courts for many years -", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "1.

He was able to talk but he was obviously in discomfort.\"\nEast of England Ambulance trust dispatched a team at the second highest level.\nBecause they were busy, they sent a private ambulance team - a regular occurrence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe team from Private Ambulance Service Limited didn't have a paramedic on board. The most senior member of the crew was an emergency technician called Lauren de la Haye.\nShe received her qualification certificate a few days before, although she had practised as an emergency medic under supervision for several years.\nMrs Page remembers Ms de la Haye saying: \"It is definitely not your heart, you are definitely not having a heart attack.\n\"I wish all my patients were like you sitting here talking to me.\"\nThe team carried out two heart traces, one with four leads, the other with 12.\nThe results showed that Gary's heart beat was abnormal. \"Abnormal ECG\" was written across the top of one of the traces.\nMs de la Haye did not agree - even when another team member said he was worried.\nMrs Page said: \"When Gary asked, 'What do you think it could be?' Lauren de la Haye asked him what he did for a living.\n\"He explained he went into lofts as part of his job and she thought he could have pulled a muscle, or that he might have indigestion.\n\"Then she said, 'We can take you to the hospital but you will have a 10-hour wait.'\n\"She said that three times, as if it were unnecessary for him to go.\"\nStill in pain, and without his reading glasses, Mr Page signed a document that Ms de la Haye presented saying that he agreed not to go to hospital.\nThe crew left. Mrs Page says the medics did not advise them what to do if the symptoms continued.\nShe went to a nearby pharmacy to fetch indigestion medicine and painkillers while Gary took a shower.\nThe couple were relieved but Gary's symptoms did not ease.\nThey eventually went to bed and Kim fell asleep. Gary, who was 6ft 4in, moved into the spare room to get more comfortable.\nJust before dawn, Kim woke to hear unusually heavy snoring and snorting from the spare room.\nShe tried to wake Gary, first gently then more forcefully. Panicking, she called 999, and this time an NHS ambulance came.\nIt was too late. Gary took his last breath as Kim tried to revive him.\nHe died 10 hours after his symptoms started, and was just minutes away from a specialist heart unit at Basildon University Hospital.\nAn inquest heard the root cause of Gary Page's death was Lauren de la Haye's failure to identify an evolving heart attack, and her not contacting the clinical advice line for further support, even when prompted to do so by a more junior colleague.\nMs de la Haye did not attend the inquest as she was ill.\nShe told the BBC that an ECG could be difficult to interpret for a technician, and that Mr Page was advised to seek further help, which he did not do.\nShe said Gary and Kim Page fully understood what they were agreeing to when signing the transport waiver. She is now a student on another medical course.\nThe inquest also heard that the lack of a paramedic was a problem - but was not against the East of England's Ambulance Service Trust's rules.\nThe Trust offered a formal apology to Mr Page's family and said: \"The seriousness of Mr Page's condition was not recognised and further advice not sought.\"\nIn response to Mr Page's death, the rules for private ambulance crew in the East of England Trust area have been clarified.\nAny medic below the level of paramedic must either take a patient to a hospital, or phone the clinical advice line at East of England Ambulance Service to explain why the patient can be discharged.\nSpending on private ambulances to answer 999 calls in England has trebled in the past four years.\nIn 2011-12 ambulances trusts spent about \u00c2\u00a322m. By this year, the figure was closer to \u00c2\u00a369m.\nThe private sector offers higher pay to their staff and ambulance trusts find it harder to compete for qualified staff as there is a shortage of paramedics.\nThe number of calls for an ambulance has also more than doubled in the last decade to more than nine million a year.\nMrs Page's solicitor, Stephanie Prior, believes the general public is largely unaware of the extent to which private ambulance crews are used in emergency situations.\nShe said: \"They wear the same green uniforms as NHS ambulance crews and patients put their trust in them.\n\"But unlike with a doctor, nurse or paramedic, emergency assistants or technicians are not on any professional register.\n\"No-one but their direct employer knows how qualified they are or how experienced.\n\"There is no way to record it if they make a mistake or should be struck off.\"\nBut the Independent Ambulance Association believes the public shouldn't be alarmed.\nAlan Howson, from the association, said: \"We were very sorry to learn of this incident and our thoughts are with the victim's family and loved ones.\n\"Many personnel in the independent sector are both current and former NHS staff and highly qualified.\n\"Ideally technicians should be under the supervision of paramedics.\n\"If they were registered separately then it would mean they are more accountable and could be 'struck off' if they were shown to have malpractised.\"\nIt is little comfort to Kim Page. \"I've lost the love of my life,\" she said.\n\"He should be here with me now, because this was all unnecessary and now I've got to find a way of living without him, and I don't want to.\"", "summary": "A widow is suing an ambulance trust after it dispatched a private ambulance whose crew failed to spot her husband was starting to have a heart attack.", "id": "37563871", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

Every other one said no, just straight out no.\"\nWhat surprised her most, she says, is that it wasn't that these eight and nine-year-old girls didn't know what engineering was. Simply that they had already switched off.\n\"So how much work does it take to change that?\" asks Ms Bonfield. \"I mean it's huge.\"\nThere's no shortage of data to back up her estimation of the scale of work required. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that women make up around just 8% of engineers in the UK.\nAnd this is at a time when the UK needs to produce thousands more engineers, so much so that the inventor, Sir James Dyson, is planning to open his own institute to address the skills shortage.\nFurther back in the chain that links school, university and then employment, other data show that 49% of state schools send no girls to study A-level physics. And of those students who are taking an A-level in the subject, only a fifth are girls - despite getting similar grades at GCSE as boys.\nAt the John Warner School in Hertfordshire, where you can take a GCSE in engineering, Dawn Bonfield's discoveries would come as no surprise to the girls in the GCSE and A-level groups. They are well aware of the stigma surrounding women and engineering. It seems even in the 21st Century it is still thought of as a job for a man.\n\"It starts at a young age... and that's just what we've grown up with,\" says Sophie, who did an engineering GCSE, but isn't continuing it to A-level, because of a timetable clash.\nShe puts it down partly to the fact that \"girls are just put in the corner with a doll\" - while boys play with trucks and cars - and partly down to the idea that manual labour is the preserve of men.\n\"It's only when you get to GCSE age that that option's offered to you, so a lot of people might still at that age be thinking, 'Oh well, I shouldn't be doing building or coding,' and stuff like that.\"\nThe girls at the John Warner School seem to defy some of these perceptions - 11 out of 13 of them said they would consider a career as an engineer. Nevertheless all of them are vastly outnumbered by boys in their different GCSE and A-level classes in engineering. And they're in the minority in physics and maths classes too.\nSexual stereotyping and not enough female role models are well documented as reasons why girls don't choose engineering.   As are misconceptions about the job itself, which isn't always about getting your hands dirty.\nCampaigns such as the Institution of Engineering and Technology's  \"#9PercentIsNotEnough\" are trying to address this.\nIn addition, in one of the many recent reports concerned with the dearth of girls pursuing science, technology and engineering (Stem) subjects, the attitude of parents was also cited as an important factor in career choices. For girls, perhaps unsurprisingly, mothers were particularly influential.\n\"My mum was a bit iffy about it at first cos she was more like, 'Girls should do this and that and the other,' more like 'keep your posture up and be ladylike',\" says GCSE student Hannah.\n\"But my dad used to build a lot of stuff and he got me into that. So after my mum saw how me and my dad interacted she said, 'Yeah, go for it' and she's kind of the one who supported me with this.\"\nEducating parents, as well as the girls themselves and their teachers, is key believes Helen Macadam, a civil engineer who works on railway projects for the construction company Skanska.\n\"For me it's all about being more open and being more transparent and showing people, because what is [an] engineer? It covers so many different jobs, you can't even begin to describe it. And that's probably why it's so difficult to promote it,\" she says. \"It's almost whatever job you want.\"\nThe UK has a particularly low percentage of female engineers, other European countries put the figure at around 20%. In the US it's 14%, according to a recent congressional estimate, but the same question preoccupies the profession on the other side of the Atlantic too.\n\"There's no silver bullet,\" says Lina Nilsson, a biomedical engineer who works for a medical equipment company. She, however, believes she might have found one answer. When she was the innovation director in the Blum Center for developing economies at the University of California, Berkeley, the department started offering a postgraduate course on solutions for low-income communities.\nHalf the students who enrolled in the first classes in the autumn of 2014 were women.\nMs Nilsson thinks it was the obvious, practical good that designing an affordable solution for clean drinking water, or medical diagnostic equipment for tropical diseases, would do, that drew women to the course.\n\"The rationale of why to do it, not how, is really powerful,\" she says. \"It's engineering with a social impact. On traditional courses it becomes hidden, or assumed that young students know what the purpose of engineering is. In fact we only have a vague idea of what it is.\"\nThe UK is following suit. Several universities and colleges are finding new ways of teaching engineering that are aimed at pulling in a more diverse group of students.\nSome courses are experimenting with dropping physics and maths A-level as a prerequisite for engineering. Others are offering courses, such as humanitarian engineering, which are popular with women.\nBut she has another solution to the engineering problem. \"Maybe, if we didn't call it engineering, if we didn't say, 'Do you want to be an engineer?'\" she suggests.\n\"If you just completely rebranded it and said, 'How would you feel about a career being a problem solver?' That immediately just sounds like something that you can apply to anything, that you could do in whatever context interests you.\"\nThe A-level students at the John Warner School would probably agree with her. They are aware that women are not stereotypically seen as problem solvers, but that's not their view.\n\"Women are good at fixing problems,\" Alice, Georgia and Cerys tell me. \"Men are expected to do it and praised when they do do it, but women kind of do it naturally and it doesn't get really noticed.\"", "summary": "When Dawn Bonfield, the former chief executive of the Women's Engineering Society, ran a stand recently at a big military airshow, she was in for a shock.", "id": "37254851", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe A-level students at the John Warner School would probably agree with her.

His primary focus has always been the athletes, and this decision is something he has taken to allow them to focus on their preparation for Rio,\" said Drake.\nSutton's predecessor, Sir Dave Brailsford, said the Australian's contribution to the success of British cycling had been \"immense\".\nBrailsford, who oversaw a British team that won eight gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, said: \"His sole focus has always been the athletes, and so it's understandable that if he feels this has become a distraction to their preparation for Rio he has put the interests of the team first and decided to stand down.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nVarnish, 25, who was dropped from the GB team after failing to qualify for the sprint team for Rio, said she spoke out against Sutton in order to change attitudes at British Cycling.\nSutton, who has been a GB coach since 2002, denies Varnish's claims, which include him making a sexist comment about her body shape.\nHe said that Varnish's contract was not renewed because her times had slowed over the past three years and she was unlikely to win a medal, saying she was \"not up to the job\".\n\"There was never any talk of babies,\" he told The Times.\nHe insisted he had never used the terminology \"you've got a fat arse\", adding: \"I'm just really upset she would say that.\"\nBritish Cycling had already begun an \"independent review\" into its performance programmes following Varnish's comments.\nIt then started a further investigation and suspended Sutton on Wednesday after Darren Kenny, one of Britain's most decorated Para-cyclists, told the Daily Mail he heard members of the British disability team referred to as \"gimps\".\nKenny, 46, who won six Paralympic gold medals, later told BBC Sport the use of the word \"became common\".\n\"I never heard the term 'wobblies' but the other term, I don't think there is anyone at British Cycling who hasn't heard it.

escapes, the Crumlin Road Gaol is a symbol of Ireland's turbulent history.\nThe final day of March in 2016 marks 20 years since the gaol closed its doors to prisoners and, over the course of 150 years, it has been at the heart of many historic moments.\nMarched in chains\nHistorian \u00c9amon Phoenix describes the building as \"grey, black and forbidding\".\nIn the mid-19th century, public executions took place on gallows in the gaol's yard in front of crowds of up to 20,000.\nThe imposing building still standing proud on the Crumlin Road replaced the old County Gaol in Carrickfergus, County Antrim.\nBased on a design by eminent architect and engineer Sir Charles Lanyon, the gaol was built in the Italian renaissance style between 1843 and 1845 and was seen as one of the most advanced prisons of its day.\nTo populate Belfast's newest landmark, 106 inmates were marched the 11 miles from Carrickfergus in chains.\nThe prisoners included men, women and children, with each group segregated within the new gaol.\nSegregation was to become a consistent theme throughout the gaol's history.\nPolitical prisoners\nInside its thick fortified walls the Crum, as it is commonly known, has housed more than 25,000 people including murderers, suffragettes, petty thieves, and republican and loyalist prisoners.\nDuring the Troubles in Northern Ireland, many notable figures were detained there.\nPrior to their role as politicians, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness both had spells at the Crum, as did loyalist Michael Stone and IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.\nOne of the more curious incidents in the the gaol's history led to the then Sinn F\u00e9in leader \u00c9amon de Valera being arrested in 1924 for illegally crossing the border in Newry, flouting an order barring him from entering Northern Ireland.\n\"This imprisonment was the worst prison experience of his life,\" Dr Phoenix said.\n\"He was held in solitary confinement for months and described the food as so bad that he used to feed it to the crows through the bars\".\nHe returned to the cells of north Belfast in 1929.\nAgain his crime was crossing the border illegally, but he found his second stay a much more pleasurable experience, as Dr Phoenix explains: \"De Valera befriended the governor - they had dinner and played chess together.\n\"And until the end of the governor's days he received a Christmas card from President \u00c9amon de Valera.\"\nSuffragette struggle\nDuring the early 1900s those calling for universal suffrage became increasingly vocal, and groups like the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) were becoming ever more radical.\nMiddle-class women were the core of suffrage movement in Ulster and it was Dorothy Evans who led the WSPU campaign in Ulster.\nEvans went so far as to \"declare war\" on Edward Carson for his lack of progress on the issue, even after he unexpectedly announced that women's suffrage would be granted in 1913.\nFor Evans and fellow suffragette Madge Muir, this was not enough and they took matters into their own hands.\nIn 1914, the pair were arrested for possession of explosive substances after a series of arson attacks.\nAfter a police raid on their home uncovered a weapons cache, the women were immediately arrested.\nEvans put up so much resistance that she had to be restrained by a number of officers during the court hearing.\nThis resulted in proceedings being moved to the Crumlin Road Gaol.\nThe court was in fact moved to a desk in the corridor outside Evans's cell door.\nAfter the magistrate remanded the women in custody, they promptly began a hunger strike which led to their release under the so-called Cat and Mouse Act of 1913, which allowed for the early release of prisoners who were so weakened by hunger striking that they were at risk of death.\nUpon their release, the women hired a car, decked it with suffragette flags and defiantly drove around Belfast passing the court where they had caused much outrage.\nUnsurprisingly, they were soon returned to the Crum's A-wing, which played host to female prisoners.\nHangman's noose\nAs Eddie Cullens walked to the gallows, he was still pleading his innocence thousands of miles from home.\nA Jewish-American gangster, Cullens was convicted of the murder of Turkish circus worker Achmet Musa in Carrickfergus.\nThe details would not have been out of place in a gangster movie.\nMusa had been shot in the head and his body dumped in a field, naked except for a blue and white swimming cap.\nHanged in 1932, Cullens was one of 17 men executed at Crumlin Road Gaol.\nFifteen of the bodies still remain buried in unconsecrated graves within the prison walls.\nThe only outward signs of their presence are the initials next to their year of execution, which are scrawled on the walls.\nThe final execution at the gaol, and indeed Northern Ireland, was that of Robert McGladdery in 1961.\nMcGladdery was convicted of the murder of Pearl Gamble, strangled and stabbed in a field near her home in Newry, County Down.\n\"Well, my Lord, there are a lot of things I could say, but I don't think it would make any difference now\", said a resigned McGladdery in court as he learned of his fate.\nThe future\nSince the heavy prison gates closed for the final time in 1996, the Crumlin Road Gaol has been transformed.\nIt is now a grade A listed building and has been redeveloped into a museum, becoming tourist destination.\nThe gaol welcomed Queen Elizabeth II in 2014.\nOn her visit she was flanked by Northern Ireland's then First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.\nBoth were former inmates of the Crumlin Road Gaol.\nAs Dr Phoenix said: \"It has now made the radical transformation from symbol of the Troubles to heritage site.\"\nBut although it now plays host to public tours, movie screenings and music concerts, it is said that the walls still echo and howl of a time that the Crum was a bastion of pain and suffering.", "summary": "A fortress in the heart of north Belfast, it was once dubbed 'Europe's Alcatraz'.", "id": "35916907", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Crumlin Road Gaol

Since then passengers numbers have dropped and latest figures show it made a loss of more than \u00a3300,000 in 2011.\nWhatever your views on the price, it has always been striking how passionate people feel about Cardiff Airport.\nBringing it back into public ownership, in what is one of the most high profile acquisitions ever undertaken by the Welsh government, will inevitably heighten those passions.\n\"Airports across the world are commercial businesses operating in highly competitive markets and the global trend is towards privatisation of these assets, not nationalisation.\n\"Bristol Airport has never been concerned about competition from Cardiff or other airports, provided that competition is on a level playing field without any form of state subsidy or government support.\"\nThe airport's existing staff will remain but only 40 are employed directly.\nAn average of around 1,000 staff work on the site as sub-contractors but that figure can vary considerably.\nIn the months leading up to today, Mr Jones said the airport gave a bad impression of Wales as it fell behind its rivals.\nThe owners said at the time that they had no plans to sell but would listen to offers.\nOnly this month there was bad news when Swiss carrier Helvetic announced it was pulling out, two years after the Welsh government spent \u00a3500,000 marketing Wales in Switzerland.\nHelvetic started flying to Zurich from Cardiff in 2011, but had already dropped winter services after low demand and will not fly this summer.\nHowever, Spanish airline Vueling said it was increasing services to Malaga and Alicante from Cardiff after a \"positive response from Welsh travellers\".\nAsked if the purchase was a gamble, Business Minister Edwina Hart said it was \"the right thing to do.\"\nBut opposition politicians were sceptical of the Welsh government's involvement in trying to turn around the airport's fortunes.\n\"I have yet to be convinced that a 1970s-style nationalisation is the answer to the airport's problems,\" said the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies.\n\"When you consider the recent decision by Helvetic to withdraw, in spite of the Welsh government having invested around half-a-million pounds, it is far from clear that the first minister is the best man for the job of rescuing this airport.\"\nEluned Parrott, Welsh Liberal Democrat economy and transport spokesperson, called on the Welsh government to \"urgently announce its plans to transform the airport\".\nPlaid Cymru also said it wanted to see the detail of the government's plans.\n\"There is no reason why a publicly-owned national airport for Wales could not be far more successful than the airport in its present state,\" said party leader Leanne Wood.", "summary": "Troubled Cardiff Airport has been sold to the Welsh government for \u00a352m.", "id": "21952079", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Welsh government has bought Cardiff Airport from Spanish company Abertis for \u00a352m.\nThe airport, which has been in private ownership since 2005, will be run by a new company, Cardiff Airport Limited, which will be owned by the Welsh government.\nThe Welsh government said it would not be operated by the government and would be managed \"at arm's length\" and \"on a commercial basis\".\nThe Welsh government", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Welsh government has bought Cardiff Airport from its Spanish owners for \u00a352m.\nThe airport was bought by Abertis in 2005 for \u00a3150m.\nThe Welsh government said it was the right thing to do.\nThe Welsh government said it was the right thing to do.

Founded in 1971 by the late Christian political activist and television evangelist Jerry Falwell, the school usually hosts religious luminaries and conservative politicians, and made headlines in 2009 for rescinding official recognition for its chapter of the College Democrats because of the party's position on abortion and gay marriage.\nLiberty officials extended invitations for presidential candidates from both parties to speak at their weekly convocation, however, and Mr Sanders is the only Democrat so far to accept. Republicans Ben Carson and Scott Walker are scheduled to address the mandatory weekly student meetings later this year.\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination at Liberty in March.\nMr Cruz, however, was preaching to ideological soul-mates. Mr Sanders, on the other hand, has admitted that the majority of the students at Liberty \"look at the world differently\" than he does.\nAt the very start of his speech Mr Sanders defended his liberal positions and took note that they likely weren't viewed favourably among this audience.\n\"I understand that issues such as abortion and gay marriage are very important to you. We disagree on those issues. I get that,\" he said.\n\"But let me respectfully suggest that there are other issues out there that are of enormous consequence to our country and in fact to the entire world and that maybe, just maybe, we do not disagree on. And maybe, just maybe, we can try work together to resolve them.\"\nThe senator then spoke about the central focus of his campaign - income inequality and economic justice - leavened with the occasional biblical verse, a nod to the religious bent of the crowd.\n\"When we talk about morality, and when we talk about justice, we have to in my view understand that there is no justice when so few have so much, and so many have so little,\" he said.\nIt's the kind of line that's usually met with thunderous applause. This time, however, the auditorium was largely silent, save for the fierce cheers from a small knot of non-student supporters packed near the stage.\nThe Liberty convocation building doubles as its sports arena, and the whole thing had the feeling of visiting fans at a sold-out basketball game celebrating after their team made a game-winning shot.\nAnd so it went for much of the speech. Calls for raising the minimum wage, providing more support for new mothers and making college education free largely fell flat save for approbation from the loyal few.\nAt the conclusion of his speech, Mr Sanders was presented with several questions from the students.\nHis response to the first, on racism, garnered polite applause. The second, on abortion, revealed just how large a chasm remained between the candidate and his audience.\nWhat would the senator do to protect \"children in the womb\", he was asked, to thunderous cheers.\n\"This is an area in which we disagree,\" he said. \"It is improper for the United States government or state government to tell every women in this country the very painful and difficult choice that she has to make on that issue.\"\nHe went on to attack a budget proposed by Republicans in Congress that reduces funding for children's healthcare, college aid and low-income food programmes, while cutting taxes \"to the top 2%\".\n\"I don't think that is a moral budget,\" he said.\nThe efforts for finding common ground - at least for this morning - were at an end.\nAfter the speech, members of the audience offered mixed reviews.\n\"I didn't really agree with anything he had to say,\" said Star Perez, a freshman from Chester, Virginia. She said that while she and Mr Sanders might be able to join together on some basic principles, that's where the \"common ground\" ends.\n\"When it comes to what to do with those, and as president what are you going to do to affect the country, how he's going to do those things, that's where there's a total disconnect.\"\nThomas Howard, a sophomore from Kentucky, gave Mr Sanders credit for making an appearance in a possibly hostile environment. \"I thought it was awesome to get another view than what we're used to here,\" he said.\nHe added that he strongly disagreed with the senator's views on abortion and healthcare, however, and couldn't see himself ever supporting his candidacy.\nOn the social networking site Yik Yak, which made headlines when Liberty University students offered snide comments during Mr Cruz's speech, the comments were often sharper.\n\"If you don't like being poor, work to become rich,\" wrote one commenter. \"That's what we call the American Dream, and it's what makes America great.\"\n\"Saw a guy with a Bernie shirt on my way to class today,\" posted another. \"Took everything in me not to punch him. Lord give me strength to hold back.\"\nBethany Dupre, who received her master's degree in counselling from Liberty University in June, said she was disappointed in the reception given to Mr Sanders from the student body.\n\"It sounded like in this big place there were only 10 of us clapping for him,\" she said.\n\"I would like to think that a lot of students would go home and do some more research into the issues, but I think a lot of them will just go with the Liberty University pat answer for those questions.\"\nMr Sanders' speech comes on the heels of the latest round of polls that show him leading in the key early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\nAnd although he still trails Hillary Clinton by double-digit margins in national polls, her support has dropped precipitously over the past few months.\nAll of this has some analysts wondering if Mr Sanders has a rightful claim to title of frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\nIt's a development that the 73-year-old Mr Sanders has admitted has caught him a bit off guard.\n\"Yes, I'm stunned,\" Mr Sanders said in  a recent television interview. He said he didn't think his campaign's ascent would be as dramatic, but added: \"Look, we have a message that I believed from day one was going to resonate with the American people.\"\nMr Sanders' message is definitely resonating with the Democratic voters in places like New Hampshire and Iowa right now.\nWinning over the American people, however, will be a much more challenging task. He'll have to talk to, and convince, voters who are not within his natural base of support.\nHis speech at Liberty University is a step in that direction - but also shows how much work he has yet to do.", "summary": "Over the past few months Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has packed arenas for campaign appearances around the country.", "id": "34229555", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

Labourers were banned from leaving their homes to find better wages elsewhere and those who broke the law were put in stocks.\nEvery town or village was required by law to have a set. But being put in the stocks was a fairly minor punishment. Many places had whipping posts, pillories and even gallows.\nHere's a ghoulish tour of England's harsh past.\nStocks were used to hold the legs of miscreants - usually vagabonds or drunkards - while people threw rotten vegetables at them.\nSome places specified only \"soft material\" was thrown, effectively preventing victims from being stoned (or potatoed?) to death.\nDavid Bretherton, the driving force behind Thame's whimsy, insists being put in the stocks wasn't always nasty.\n\"If the person was well-liked they might have been showered with flowers. In other cases, they would have had their shoes and socks removed and their feet tickled.\"\nMost stocks were wooden and therefore susceptible to rot - although in some villages they were metallic.\nIron stocks in West Derby village were placed in their current position in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII, which is a tribute rarely seen today.\nThe phrase \"laughing stock\" - defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"an object of general ridicule\" probably didn't originate from the use of stocks, etymologists say.\nA \"stock\" in that sense was an archaic word for a branchless tree stump or post and came to represent a person who was laughed at.\nOften confused with stocks, pillories are further up the medieval punishment rankings. Whereas stocks hold the legs, pillories hold the neck and wrists.\nWriter Daniel Defoe was put in a pillory on three days in July 1703, following the publication of The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, which was deemed seditious libel.\nAccording to History Today's Richard Cavendish, Defoe \"was put for an hour each time in three of the busiest places in London - outside the Royal Exchange in Cornhill (near his own home), near the conduit in Cheapside and finally in Fleet Street by Temple Bar.\n\"It seems to have been raining steadily most of the time, which though uncomfortable would have kept the crowds down, and the experience proved more of a triumph than an ordeal,\" he says.\n\"All that was thrown at him were flowers while his friends sold the spectators copies of The Shortest Way and [a new work] A Hymn to the Pillory which he had composed for the occasion.\"\nDefoe's experience, though, was atypical. Some people, having been pelted with dead cats and dogs, stones, saucepans and other missiles - as well as rotten fruit and eggs - were maimed or even killed, Mr Cavendish says.\nA gibbet can be any instrument of public execution, including guillotine, executioner's block, impalement stake, hanging gallows, or related scaffold, but \"gibbeting\" is specifically using a gallows to display the body of an executed criminal. Winter's Gibbet in Elsdon, in Northumberland, is where a man called William Winter was suspended in chains after being hanged in Newcastle in 1792 for the murder of an old woman.\nApparently, his rotting corpse dangled there for many years, until the structure fell apart. In 1867 a replica was built on the site, complete with a wooden mannequin. The body was stolen but a wooden head remains.\nPieces of the gibbet were once reputed to be able to cure toothache, if rubbed on the gums.\nThe remains of an original set of gallows can be seen in Potsford Woods near Wickham Market in Suffolk.\nThe story goes that a Jonah Snell bludgeoned to death a man and his son while they were working. When he was captured he was still carrying the murder weapon and was sentenced to death.\nReports claim that he was dragged up to the hanging frame on his back, giving the name \"Dragarse\" to the hill on which it stands.\nThere's a replica guillotine in Halifax, which harks back to the time when the town was a major producer of cloth.\nThe fabric had to be dried in the open air and was therefore easy to steal, so as a deterrent the crime became punishable by death in some cases.\nThe theft of items above a certain value led to a beheading. Between 1541 and 1650, 53 men and women were executed this way.\nThe replica was built in 1974 on the original site in Gibbet Street. A casting from the original blade is on display at the Bankfield Museum in Boothtown.\nA complete ducking stool is on display in Leominster Priory, Herefordshire, and the people of the town are so taken with the idea that the town clock, commissioned for the millennium, features a moving ducking stool depiction.\nIt was a wooden or iron armchair on to which the culprit was strapped. The chair was attached to a long wooden beam, usually located alongside a pond or river, and was lowered into the water.\nThe last recorded ducking cases in England are both from Leominster. Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold, was dunked in 1809. By 1817, the water in the ducking pond was so low Sarah Leeke was merely wheeled round the town in the chair.\nThe tumbrel (the wagonny bit) of a ducking stool is in the crypt of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick.\nThere is also a ducking chair in Canterbury where the High Street meets the River Stour.\nGeoffrey Abbott, author of Book of Execution, Rack, Rope, and Red-Hot Pincers, says: \"Repeated duckings routinely proved fatal, the victim dying of shock or drowning.\"\nA replica ducking stool can be seen (and posed next to) in Ducking Stool Lane in Christchurch, Dorset.\nThere was also an instrument called a cucking stool - alternatively known as a \"scolding stool\" or a \"stool of repentance\". It was a chair placed in public view, upon which the targeted person was forced to sit while being paraded through the town.\nThe village of Stow in Lincolnshire still has a whipping post situated near the church.\nWhile the people of Norton in Shropshire were clearly of an efficient bent, as they combined their stocks and whipping post.\nThey are opposite the building, which was used as the court in medieval times.", "summary": "The Oxfordshire town of Thame has announced it is considering bringing back stocks as a tourist attraction, but which other settlements have kept their instruments of medieval correction?", "id": "36641921", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The people of Norton in Shropshire were clearly of an efficient bent, as they combined their stocks and whipping post.\"\nThe stocks were removed in 1830, but the whipping post remained until 1974.\nThe stocks in the village of Westbury in Wiltshire are still in use.\nThe stocks in the village of Westbury in Wiltshire are still in use.

They have also pointed to a pressing need to reform the Vatican Curia, the central offices of the Church.\nTo appreciate the enormous task facing the next pope, secular comparisons fade in contrast with the demands of leading the oldest and largest institution in the history of the universe. The Catholic Church is 2,000 years old, has more than 1.2 billion members, and aims to reach the entire world.\nOf course, the Church is a religious institution. She organises worship, private and public, and offers spiritual formation. But she is much more. She is a humanitarian relief organisation and a global array of educational and healthcare institutions, serving Catholics and non-Catholics alike.\nShe is also a catalyst for countless research institutes and think tanks. Especially striking, in contrast with other religious communities, the Church's headquarters is based in its own sovereign state, with its own territory, diplomatic corps, judges, tribunals, financial institutions and, of course, sovereign head of state.\nThus, the Vatican coins money, prints stamps, recognises citizenship, offers passports and driver's licenses, and has embassies and other diplomatic missions with 179 sovereign states.\nFollowing the edifying example of John Paul II and Benedict XVI, the qualified candidate to be the next pope must be a spiritual leader, an internationally recognised moral authority, and a man of prayer.\nHe will also need to be capable of carrying out the executive duties of running the institutions of the Church, governing the Vatican City State, and negotiating bilateral and multilateral international accords.\nThe pope also speaks as a head of state in the UN. He actively participates in international accords regarding climate change, arms-trafficking, human-trafficking, intellectual property, border disputes, peace negotiations and bioethics.\nA long and rich theological tradition prizes the need for spiritual shepherds who also excel in management skills and the virtues of leadership. Recent developments in theology converge with components of contemporary management theory.\nTheologians increasingly emphasise that configuration in Christian holiness involves a three-fold office called tria munera that consists in governance, teaching and sanctifying.\nWhile all the baptised enjoy this three-fold office, pastors must especially excel in their leadership. To fulfil the demands of his office, the supreme pontiff must enjoy the special expertise in governance and management needed to take charge and direct the flock and therefore manage all ecclesiastical organisations, from the local parish in Papua New Guinea to the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith at the Vatican.\nThe Church can be compared to a publicly traded corporation. She is a body and is incorporated in Christ. Both canon and civil law recognise her as a corporation. The Pope has complete executive, judicial and legislative authority because Jesus gave the first pope, St Peter, the keys to loose and to bind in Heaven and on Earth. In fact, the Pope runs a corporation and enjoys more executive powers than any other CEO.\nBut he is accountable to a board of directors: God Himself, the Blessed Trinity. Indeed, Benedict decided to resign after prayer, that is consultation with the board. And, in leaving his corporate chair empty, Benedict has assured the members of the corporation: Don't worry, you are in Jesus's hands. I have not left you without a leader at the helm.\nWith a divine board of directors and an autocratic CEO, the Church's corporate structure may seem very old-fashioned, and it is. But it also includes modern components of participatory governance - the more than one billion shareholders.\nThe shareholders can request that the pope report regarding organisation, mission, financials, growth, and future expectations for development. Indeed, although Benedict did not need anyone but God to accept his resignation, he also chose to give an account of his resignation to all of the shareholders with an update regarding corporate performance. Benedict did just that in his last audience, the day before he formally stepped down from office.\nMany have commented that the Vatican's central offices, even aside from the scandal of Vatileaks, need an overhaul, and that the most urgent task for the next pope will be organisational reform.\nThe cardinals will be considering who will be the most capable of demonstrating personal union with God and ability to teach the faith, but also to reform the Vatican in order to implement some of the efficiencies taught in today's best business schools.\nThe Vatileaks episode offered a glimpse into some of the disfunctionality, normally due to petty squabbles among internal factions within middle management, but also drew attention to the traditional feudal structure of governance within and among the offices, and how the current structures and attitudes impede the distribution of information to facilitate efficient governance, thereby hampering the Church's mission to evangelise.\nThe Rev Robert Gahl took part in  a BBC World Service discussion On The Next Pope on 15 February\nThe Next Pope\nMore from BBC World Service\nThe culture and the attitudes of governance tend toward the antiquated vertical structures of authority found in Italian public universities, not to mention Italy's notorious criminal organisations. Advancement depends upon loyalty to one's superior, who is traditionally expected to defend the department's turf from internal rivals to safeguard career advancement, often awarded more on account of seniority and credentials than for professional performance.\nThe next pope needs to be someone knowledgeable about the curia and its language and ready to open up the channels of information flow and decision-making to free the dedicated, talented men and women working in the Vatican to more effectively serve the pope and the Church's mission of evangelisation.\nSuch reform will require more effective communication, external and internal, greater transparency, and a more flexible managerial structure.\nConfidentiality must be respected and safeguarded when dealing with matters of conscience. But in the governance of behavioural affairs, the officers serving the pope need to be free, at all levels, to co-operate in concert.\nMany of the cardinals hope that the next pope will be able to bring managerial efficiencies to the Vatican to empower all of those dedicated clerics and lay people who give their lives while serving behind those ancient walls.\nGiven the need for reform, no-one should be surprised if the next pope, while drawing from his own managerial talents, were also to rely upon experts in managerial consulting while taking on organisational reform so as to better serve the mission entrusted to him by the board of directors.\nRev Robert Gahl is an associate professor of ethics at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome and member of the Catholic Church's Opus Dei organisation", "summary": "The new head of the oldest corporation on Earth - the Catholic Church - should have the skills of a chief executive officer, argues Reverend Robert Gahl.", "id": "21658218", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Vatican is a sovereign state, with its own territory, diplomatic corps, and financial institutions.

What do they have to show for a war that has cost more than \u00c2\u00a320bn and hundreds of precious lives?\nThe British military believe they will be leaving Helmand in better shape than when they arrived.\nAcross the country, 6.7 million children now attend school, nearly half of them girls. That would have been unthinkable under the Taliban rule. Healthcare has improved; life expectancy is longer.\nBut corruption is still rife and violence, though suppressed, still threatens to tear the country apart.\nMeasuring success is perhaps hardest for those who lost loved ones here.\nRobert Foster died in Helmand in 2007. The 19-year-old private was killed when an American warplane mistakenly dropped a bomb on his position.\nHis father John says: \"Seven years on, I still struggle with the fact that my son and his mates were killed in a conflict that should never have happened.\"\nHe describes himself as being proud of what Robbie did: \"I try to hold in my heart that my son and his mates thought they were doing the right thing,\" he says.\nHe also accepts that the country is now more stable, but he wonders for how long. The Taliban have already moved back into some of the areas once occupied by the British. John asks: \"Was it worth all the hurt caused to so many?\"\nAs this long war draws to a close, it's the question that hangs in the air: \"Was it worth it?\"\nMany in the military believe it is too soon to tell; they are more reluctant to rush to judgement, when they witnessed comrades die and suffer life-changing injuries.\nIt's harder still for those who ordered men into battle. Andrew Mackay was the commander of British forces in Helmand in 2007. After reaching the heights of major general, he resigned his commission - in part out of frustration over the way the war in Afghanistan was conducted.\nLooking back, he now says: \"We should have done so much better.\" There was confusion from the start about the mission. Was it nation building, counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism?\nAs for counter-narcotics, he says: \"It's a nonsense to suggest we were there to stop heroin getting to the streets of London.\" Today poppy production in Afghanistan is at record levels.\nThe failure to explain must ultimately lie with the politicians in charge. But there were failings by the military too.  In the early days there was a switch in tactics every six months as a new brigade commander arrived with a fresh batch of soldiers, often eager to prove themselves in battle.\nIn the early days commanders did complain about not having enough men and the right equipment, but that did not seem to affect their desire to \"get the job done\".\nMr Mackay says: \"We muddled through for far too long\".\nPacifying Helmand was always going to be tough. The largest province in the country, it was remote, rural and lawless. It had long been a Taliban stronghold and centre of the drugs trade. Added to that, the British empire had history in Helmand.\nThe locals still remembered their victory at nearby Maiwand in 1880 during the second Anglo-Afghan war. The returning British may have forgotten, but the Pashtuns of the south had not.\nNor did the British really know what they were getting themselves into when they re-entered Helmand in 2006.\nDr Mike Martin, an academic and former army reservist, describes how they were \"manipulated\" by local tribes to settle old scores with rivals. He was one of the handful of officers who served in Helmand who was able to speak fluent Pashto.\nSource: BBC/MoD\nInside Camp Bastion\nHe argues the British took far too long to understand the people they were trying to win over and \"were trying to turn the war into something it was not\".\nMany still hold out hope for Afghanistan's future. It has just witnessed relatively peaceful elections and a transition of power. But there are also those who conclude the war was a mistake.\nRichard Streatfeild served as a major in the Rifles in Sangin where the British suffered some of their heaviest losses. He arrived as a believer in the mission, but left with many doubts.\nIn his book Honourable Warriors, he concludes: \"Any reading of the culture, the history or politics should have prevented us from taking on Helmand.\"\nAs the British now prepare to leave for good, he says: \"It may be dressed up as victory, but it will be the paint on the grave.\"\nWhatever legacy Britain leaves behind in Helmand, Afghanistan already appears to have had an impact on British foreign policy and any future military intervention.\nMr Mackay asks the question: \"Has it dented our confidence so much that we can not longer put boots on the ground?\" Looking at the responses to the crises in Syria and Iraq, his answer is \"yes\".\nMaj Gen Andrew Mackay's Afghanistan: The Lessons of War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 25 November", "summary": "After 13 years, eight of them involving bloody fighting in Helmand, Britain's war in Afghanistan is finally over.", "id": "29744972", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe British military believe they will be leaving Helmand in better shape than when they arrived.\nThe British military believe they will be leaving Helmand in better shape than when they arrived.

The resulting default meant that it has not been able to borrow further money on the international markets since then.\nTwo successive restructuring deals, in 2005 and 2010, covered the overwhelming majority of bondholders, who agreed to accept about one-third of what they were originally owed.\nBut hedge funds NML and Aurelius Capital Management bought up a large chunk of the remaining distressed debt at a discount and are now pressing to be paid the full face value of their holding.\nThis ethically controversial practice has earned them the nickname of \"vulture funds\". But unabashed by any moral qualms, they have fought their case all the way to the top of the US judicial system - and won.\nNow the fear is that not just the two hedge funds, but all those bondholders who stayed out of the restructuring will have to be repaid in full.\n\"At this stage, it is unclear what course policymakers will follow, but there is a clear risk of another default,\" says consultancy Capital Economics in its latest economic outlook for Argentina.\n\"This would be another blow to attempts by Argentine authorities to regain access to global capital markets.\"\nThe crunch date is Monday 30 June, when Argentina is due to make a $900m interest payment to those who accepted the debt restructuring. The US court ruling orders them to settle with the vulture funds at the same time, by handing over $1.5bn.\nThis could trigger litigation from other investors in the same situation, which is why Argentina is uncomfortable with the idea. However, it is unclear just how big the final bill for this would be.\nThe government says that paying off all the \"hold-outs\" would cost $15bn, more than half of the central bank's depleted foreign currency reserves. But not everyone agrees.\n\"We sense that the government may be overstating the cost,\" says David Rees, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. \"Most independent estimates put the cost of settling closer to $8bn.\"\nEven if Argentina fails to make some kind of downpayment on the $1.5bn by the due date, there is a 30-day grace period before an actual default can be declared.\nAs Mr Rees says: \"Finding a way forward that is agreeable to all sides will be difficult, but not impossible. The hold-outs appear to be in the driving seat, so reaching an agreement may boil down to how many concessions the Argentine government is prepared to make.\"\nAll of this is distracting Argentina's policymakers from broader problems, stemming from what another research organisation, Consensus Economics, calls \"an increasingly unsustainable economic model, propped up by currency and capital controls\".\nGDP has now been in decline for two successive quarters, meeting the technical definition of a recession, and conditions are not expected to improve until well into 2015. Analysts believe the country's economy will contract by 1% this year.\nEven the past achievements of President Fernandez and her predecessor in the post, her late husband Nestor Kirchner, are now being called into question.\nSupporters of left-leaning governments in Latin America have hailed the surge in growth that occurred on the couple's watch since 2003, while overlooking the fact that Argentina's economy is still considerably smaller than it was before the meltdown.\nBut now it appears that growth figures in previous years were often exaggerated. In May, the country's statistical office published some revealing revisions of historic data.\nAccording to Consensus Economics: \"In real GDP terms, the economy grew much less than expected. For example, in 2008, an initially reported 6.8% outturn was slashed to 3.1%.\n\"This is tacit admission that the government previously overestimated GDP (not to mention production and inflation) data to paint a more impressive picture of activity.\"\nPresident Fernandez is due to leave office in October 2015. Analysts expect government spending to remain high in the run-up to the next presidential election, with inflation remaining at about 25% to 30%. What will happen under a new president is anyone's guess.", "summary": "Never mind the \"vulture funds\", high inflation and slowing growth: amid all their economic woes, Argentines can take heart from their national team's World Cup performance.", "id": "27974744", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "Argentina's economy is still considerably smaller than it was before the meltdown.\nThe country's economic meltdown of 2001-02, it was left unable to repay or service more than $100bn of debt.

In the closing moments Stieber coolly lifted the ball over the keeper to seal the win.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt was also a memorable day for Hungary keeper Gabor Kiraly, 40, who overtook Lothar Matthaus' record to become the oldest player to appear at a European Championship finals.\nHe defied his years when he dived low to his left to save Junuzovic's deflected shot but, overall, he had little to do.\nFormer West Brom and Fulham midfielder Zoltan Gera, 37, was an influential presence for Hungary in midfield as he made the most tackles of any player on the way to a famous win for his country.\nAustria had high hopes at Euro 2016 after they won nine out of 10 matches in an unbeaten qualifying campaign.\nHowever, Alaba's early effort aside, they struggled to live up to the expectation as key forwards Zlatko Junuzovic, Marko Arnautovic and Marc Janko were comfortably marshalled by the Hungary defence.\nArnautovic did produce one lovely flick in a one-two that opened up the Hungarian defence but, after receiving the ball at the far post, Martin Harnik mishit his effort at goal.\nJunuzovic, who had 10 assists in the Bundesliga as he helped Werder Bremen avoid relegation last season, went off with an ankle injury and Austria manager Marcel Koller will be concerned by the seriousness of that as well as the lack of cohesion and quality from his side.\nAustria coach Marcel Koller: \"I think we started well. Essentially I think we were too nervous in the first half and lost the ball too often unnecessarily.

of between \u00a35m and \u00a318m a year and property sales could raise up to \u00a334m for the force.\nA total of 397 properties were operated by the force in 2013 and since then 44 have been declared surplus to requirements.\nIn 2014, dozens of police front counters were closed in a move which was widely criticised by Scotland's main opposition parties.\nUnder the new proposals, police officers and civilian staff may be asked to share office space with other public agencies in a system which is already operating in parts of Scotland.\nThe first combined emergency services station opened in Tomintoul in April 2014, where police, ambulance and the fire service operate from one building.\nAnd in Cupar in Fife, police officers work alongside council staff.\nPolice Scotland said they are consulting on the possibility of sharing the existing Hawick police station with partner agencies.\nHowever Oliver Mundell, a Scottish Conservative, fears the move could ultimately threaten the visible presence of police officers in local communities.\n\"Of the stations that are closing in Dumfries and Galloway, Police Scotland's justification is that they're not routinely manned,\" he said.\n\"Two or three years ago [when they closed the front counters], they promised the stations would stay open.\n\"The problem with the proposal to share space is that two or three years down the line, they'll see that they're not being used, then they'll be removed all together.\"\nGreen MSP John Finnie, a former police officer who sits on Holyrood's justice committee, said it was \"entirely right\" that public agencies assess their property portfolio.\nBut he added: \"If this is part of a further withdrawal from communities, that would be very worrying...

Now that I am in a leadership position, my husband has started listening to me, and the neighbourhood also looks to me for solutions to its problems.\"\nOn the wall next to her was a hand-drawn map of Korail's households, divided into sectors, with those in most need marked in red.\nNext to it was the neighbourhood's action plan - a record of the priorities identified, and who was responsible for delivering them.\nIn this way, the people of Korail have asked for - and built - footpaths and drains, and negotiated with the local authority for water supplies.\nBut they are probably proudest of their new latrines and the transformation of a muddy piece of land used for open defecation into a block of six toilets.\nIt was their idea to assign each toilet to a group of 10 families, who are then responsible for keeping it clean.\nMinara, another of the elected Korail women, told me there was an immediate health benefit from the toilets.\nShe said: \"We used to get a lot of infections from the water-borne diseases, but now it's almost zero.\n\"We used to have to take the children to the hospital every week and spend a lot of money on medicines. Now we can save that, or spend it on food.\"\nAs I looked at the signs on the doors of the toilets - UK Aid - from the British people - I wondered how many UK taxpayers would appreciate all the different ways in which these simple toilets were life-changing in Korail, not just for health, but human dignity.\nMinara smiled broadly as she told me: \"I would like to thank the people who paid for this. They have given us a better life.\"\nBeyond physical improvements to the slum, the clusters also have a role in identifying those among them who would benefit from loans or grants, or help with new skills so they can get a job.\nAnd the empowerment goes beyond the women's contact with aid agencies and NGOs.\nShoma told me that her position representing the community has given her the courage to go to the police with a complaint about a pair of neighbourhood thugs.\nIn the past, contact with the police would have been avoided by anyone living in Korail, particularly the women.\nKazi Morshed of the UNDP has no doubt that the experiment has been a success, and hopes that it can be replicated beyond Bangladesh.\n\"The results have changed lives and livelihoods, income levels have gone up, people have savings and hope for tomorrow.\"\nFurther down the street, I could see evidence of the same organisation and identification of need at a maternity centre run by Brac, Bangladesh's dominant NGO.\nThe mission of its doctors was to reduce the numbers of home births in Korail, which in 2007 amounted to 86% of all deliveries.\nThe approach is house to house - a woman from the neighbourhood is given basic training and asked to identify any pregnant women.\nWhen one is found, a poster is stuck up in her home with the telephone number of the maternity centre, and community health workers are sent in for her ante-natal check-ups.\nI followed the team as they went to see a young woman called Beauty, seven months pregnant with her second child.\nHer blood pressure was taken, and advice given on nutrition and rest, with everything recorded in a notebook kept by the patient as a complete history of her pregnancy.\nMore than 800,000 households have joined roughly 2,500 community development committees, mostly led by women.\n166,000 households are now accessing improved water sources while 143,000 households have new toilets. Over 90% of households report being satisfied with these improvements.\nMore than 88,000 extremely poor women have been supported to set up their own businesses through small enterprise grants.\n376,000 households now participate in savings and credit groups with more than $5m of savings and $3.7m worth of loans at the end of 2012.\nToday, home births in Korail are down to 11% of deliveries, and Bangladesh is on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal on maternal mortality.\nIn spite of all these improvements, Korail is still a tough place to live.\nOn the other side of the slum I saw the old style \"hanging toilets\", where people defecate straight into the lake, with the sky line of rich Dhaka a stone's throw away.\nBut from the women who had managed to bring improvements to their part of Korail, I saw an admirable confidence - a belief in their own ability not just to pinpoint what their community requires, but also to find solutions.\nThey now know that their voices matter, and from that, there's no going back.", "summary": "In the centre of Dhaka, a few streets away from high rise office blocks and the penthouses of the wealthy, lies the city's biggest slum.", "id": "33308274", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.

In her column, she talks about why women should receive equal pay in the sports world and how it is often open to corruption.\nAt London 2012, I was part of the British Olympic road race team working for Lizzie Armitstead as she claimed Great Britain's first medal of the Games.\nIt was four years on from my triumph in the same event in Beijing and it was incredible to see the huge crowds lining the roads in London and Surrey in the pouring rain, willing us on. It vindicated what I had said many times - women's road cycling was a spectacle people wanted to see.\nThe public are actually far more fair-minded than they are painted by many a sports journalist or marketing executive. They value their daughters' achievements as highly as those of their sons.\nRead the full column here\nAfter winning 16 Paralympic medals, including 11 golds, and six London Marathon titles during her wheelchair racing career, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has swapped the racing track for the House of Lords, where she now sits as a cross-bench peer.\nGrowing up in Wales, I was probably quite a shy child and sport gave me confidence and something to focus on. I really liked school but I also really loved that physical element of training.\nI don't remember a point where I didn't want to be involved in sport. It was a really natural thing for me.\nAs a result, sport has given me everything that I have got now.\nRead the full column here\nAt London 2012, Nicola Adams became the first female to win an Olympic boxing gold medal.  Adams was recently awarded Role Model of the Year by the Women's Sport Trust, and she talks about the impact successful sportswomen can have on the lives of others and explains why it's important for women to be inspired by other women.\nIt will come as no surprise to learn I had no female boxers to look up to when I was younger. My heroes were all men.\nI grew up in a boxing-mad family in Leeds, idolising Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard.  I remember watching videos of their fights and thinking it would be cool to do the same.\nI liked their personalities, their flashy styles, the way they entertained the crowd.\nWould I have benefitted from having a female boxer to idolise? It's not something I thought about when I was 12 years old.\nRead the full column here\nSports Minister Tracey Crouch MP talks about her role as a football coach and why she feels sport must raise the equality bar.\nI'm an FA-qualified football coach, and for the past eight years I've been managing a girls' team in my constituency.\nOver that time I've seen the players grow from nervous girls into strong young women. But I've also seen how they've grown as people, how the game we love has taught them about leadership, teamwork and determination, boosted their self-esteem, even helped them through difficult times.\nSport can do incredible things for women and girls, but too often we're pushed to the sidelines. When I was a girl, I was told that I shouldn't play football. That getting muddy and sweaty isn't \"ladylike\".\nRead the full column here\nThree-time world gymnastics champion Beth Tweddle talks about how puberty affected her as a young gymnast and how she managed to navigate the awkward life stage during her sporting career.\nFrom the age of five or six you're in a leotard so there's not a lot of places to hide.\nI developed quite early, I was about 12, and I remember being quite shy and quite embarrassed because my body had developed and a lot of my team-mates hadn't, but my coach took me to one side and told me to be proud of my body and that everyone develops, just at different rates, so she kind of turned me round.\nRead the full column here\nJudy Murray is a tennis coach and captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup team. She talks about her coaching career and what needs to change to enable more women to have careers in sport.\nThere were three significant moments in my coaching career where I was given opportunities which probably set me on the road to where I am now, and all of those opportunities were created by women.\nThe first was when I applied for a place on the Lawn Tennis Association's brand new performance coach award in 1994.\nThere were 20 places available - 18 went to men and just two to women. I was lucky enough to be one of those two, despite having little performance coach experience, and I'm sure I was given the chance because the head of the coach education department was a woman.\nRead the full column here\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko will be writing a regular column for the BBC Sport website throughout the World Cup.  She explains why she thinks it could be as big as the men's World Cup and asks how it could have an impact on the growing status of female players.\nRight before I was about to play my first World Cup match against Japan in 2007, I can remember turning to my England team-mate Jill Scott in the tunnel and giving her a look that said: 'Is this really happening?'\nThat tournament was in China, so the crowds were big, and I think there were 27,000 at that game in Shanghai, but the 2015 World Cup promises to be on another scale.\nRead the full column here\nMarathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe became pregnant when she was a successful athlete.  The mother-of-two talks about her decision to put her career on hold and explains how she went on to juggle motherhood with a successful running career.\nMost women are aware of their biological clock and know the decision to have children or not is a choice they will have to make. There's no set formula, everyone has to make the decision that's right for them.\nBecoming a mother was something I had always envisaged doing. Even before I had aspirations of being an athlete, I imagined having children and it wasn't something I wanted to sacrifice. But I didn't foresee a time when I wouldn't be running so I knew I'd have to work it in somehow.\nRead the full column here", "summary": "BBC Sport invited some of the most iconic women in British sport to write down their thoughts and share their experiences as a leading female sports star.", "id": "33041014", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe BBC is committed to ensuring that all of its content is accessible to all users.

Because of militant attacks, the PPP has been all but unable to campaign for the general elections due on 11 May.\nAmong the many opponents ranged against him are some of the country's most popular politicians, including former PM Nawaz Sharif and more recently former cricketer and Movement for Justice party leader Imran Khan.\nBoth have been critical of President Zardari's support for the US and Nato in the battle against Taliban militants in Afghanistan.\nYet in spite of the wide array of problems he faces, President Zardari has remained doggedly in position - outlasting Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani who in 2012 was forced out of office after the Supreme Court convicted him of contempt for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president.\nMr Zardari's mercurial career has taken many a dramatic turn since his marriage in December 1987 to the charismatic former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\nHe was thrust into the centre of politics when Ms Bhutto was assassinated 20 years later.\nSince then and now his career has veered from being imprisoned for corruption - complaining that he was tortured when behind bars - to taking the country's top job by leading the PPP to victory in general elections after his wife's death.\nPerhaps the high point of his political life came in 2008 when he played a pivotal role with former political enemies to force President Pervez Musharraf to resign.\nBut he has also been the subject of unfavourable scrutiny - in 2010 he was widely criticised for visiting Europe at the height of some of the worst floods to hit Pakistan in recent years.\nIn November 2011 he was dealt another blow by the resignation of Pakistan's ambassador to the US, Husain Haqqani.\nBoth Mr Haqqani and the president were accused of drafting a controversial memo in which they  allegedly sought US military help against a possible military coup in Pakistan. They denied the charges.\nBut his political struggles today are still a far cry from the period before Ms Bhutto's death, when Mr Zardari's public image was so bad that the PPP kept him out of the public eye as much as possible during the campaigning for national elections in February 2008.\nMr Zardari was seen then as a political liability.\nHe spent several years in jail on charges of corruption. He was labelled \"Mr 10%\" for all the kick-backs he is alleged to have received.\nHe found himself in major trouble in 1990 when he was accused, among other things, of tying a remote-controlled bomb to the leg of a businessman and sending him into a bank to withdraw money from his account as a pay-off.\nThose charges were never proved. The PPP had then accused the country's powerful intelligence apparatus of maligning Mr Zardari to damage Ms Bhutto's image.\nIn 1993, when then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan sacked the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Mr Zardari was escorted from the prison straight to the presidency where he was sworn in as a minister in the interim government.\nLater, when the PPP won the 1993 elections, Mr Zardari moved with his wife to the Prime Minister's House in Islamabad where he lived for the next three years.\nIn 1996, when another president sacked the PPP government, he was arrested and charged with a number of offences including the murder of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, his wife's brother.\nHe was later charged, along with his wife, and convicted in a kickbacks scam involving a Swiss company, SGS.\nBut a mistrial was declared by Pakistan's Supreme Court following a major scandal involving the accountability bureau and the judge who had issued the verdict.\nHis last prison sentence lasted eight years until 2004, during which time he says he was tortured.\nIt ended as the then General Musharraf was engaged in protracted negotiations with Benazir Bhutto, then in self-imposed exile, for some form of political reconciliation.\nMr Zardari resolutely stood by his party as well as his wife - although at times he disagreed with the politics of both.\nHis friends say this was entirely in character and that no-one can deny his personal courage.\nA close friend recounts an incident in the 1980s when as a horse-riding bachelor he personally rescued the daughter of a German diplomat who had fallen into a bog with her horse.\nAsif Ali Zardari was born in Karachi to Hakim Ali Zardari, head of one of the \"lesser\" Sindhi tribes, who chose the urban life over rustic surroundings.\nHe grew up in Karachi and was educated at St Patrick's School - also the alma mater of Pervez Musharraf.\nThe young Zardari's main claim to fame was that he had a private disco at home, helping him gain the reputation as a \"playboy\".\nAfter his release from prison in 2004, Mr Zardari kept a low profile, undergoing medical treatment in the US.\nIn addition to his heart problems he is reported to suffer from diabetes and a spinal ailment - which sometimes prevent him from easily moving around.\nMs Bhutto appreciated her husband's loyalty, saying that \"despite his failings, he always stood by his family no matter what\".", "summary": "Asif Ali Zardari is one of Pakistan's most controversial political figures who survived a series of personal and political setbacks to gain the presidency.", "id": "16066406", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.\tThe first elected government in Pakistan to serve a full term. 2.\tBut since taking the helm in September 2008, Mr Zardari has presided over an increasingly fragile country, a growing militant threat, a turbulent relationship with the US, an uneasy relationship with the military and nationwide flooding. 3.\tFurthermore a separatist insurgency in the south-west has not e", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nHe was a playboy, but he was also a man of principle.

A narrative of victimhood is invoked against the might of the Egyptian army and police. In contrast, the language used by the group's leaders when addressing its supporters in Arabic is laden with emotional Islamist rhetoric, including references to martyrdom and violence.\nJihad al-Haddad, the group's media spokesman, has been particularly prominent in English language media. His Twitter feed has repeatedly stressed the group's non-violent nature, tweeting on 15 August \"#MB's organizational capacity, discipline & commitment 2 non-violence ensures its peacefulness. Our peacefulness is our strength.\"\nOn 11 July 2013, in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, he asserted: \"It's democracy at the end of the day. We're all different as human beings and that's why we have to agree to the rules of democracy that govern these differences.\"\nHowever, Mr Haddad came under fire from some Egyptian social media users who accused him of misleading the Western media about events on the ground in Egypt. In June, the hashtag \"Gehad Haddad is a big liar\" was trending on Twitter, and is still a popular hashtag for Twitter users pointing out discrepancies in the Muslim Brotherhood's version of events in Egypt.\nSenior Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed al-Beltagi has been especially vocal since the current crisis began. A regular on the stage at Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiyah area, where a key pro-Morsi sit-in was held, he authored an opinion piece for The Guardian newspaper on 21 August. In the piece, he condemns the \"brutal and humiliating\" actions of the Egyptian army but maintains that the Muslim Brotherhood \"is committed to peaceful protests and has pledged never to resort to violence in response to the violence perpetrated against it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We believe that our peacefulness is a more powerful weapon than all the killing machines employed by the army or the police\".\nIn contrast, Mr Beltagi has taken a more hardline tone when addressing Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Arabic-language media. Privately-owned daily Al-Tahrir quotes Mr Beltagi as telling protestors in Rabaa al-Adawiyah on 3 July: \"Say goodbye to your mother, father, and wife, because you will sacrifice your soul to defend Muhammad Morsi's legitimacy.\"\nAs the Egyptian Presidency began to warn protesters that they would break up pro-Morsi sit-ins if they did not voluntarily vacate, Mr Beltagi urged supporters on 11 August to remain in Rabaa square, telling them \"your brothers in Algeria gave the greatest example when they offered a million martyrs. We, for the sake of peoples' freedom and dignity, are capable of offering more than that in exchange for the ouster of the occupation\".\nA video circulating online and on television in July shows Mr Beltagi saying: \"[The Muslim Brotherhood] are not controlling the current violent upheaval in Sinai, however what is happening in Sinai is in response to that military coup, [the violence] will stop once [Army Chief] Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ends the coup.\"\nThe Islamic preacher Safwat al-Hijazi has also adopted a similar tone. While not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, he is a staunch supporter and considered one of their strongest allies. In an interview with Al-Arabiya's Al-Hadath al-Misri talk show on 18 June, he warns those planning to protest against Mohammed Morsi that \"those who spray water on him [Morsi] I will spray with blood\". He repeated this warning on 21 June when addressing Morsi supporters at Rabaa al-Adawiyah.\nSimilarly, Tariq al-Zumur, an Islamist with ties to Jihad groups and a Muslim Brotherhood supporter, was granted the stage at Rabaa al-Adawiyah on 21 June and tells the crowd that those protesting against Mohammed Morsi on 30 June will be \"crushed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it will be the decisive blow\".\nThe use of doublespeak is not a new Muslim Brotherhood practice. In September 2012, the Muslim Brotherhood English-language Twitter account retweeted a message from Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Khairat al-Shatir to the US Embassy in which he says he was \"relieved none of @USembassycairo staff was hurt\". The US Embassy responded: \"Thanks. By the way, have you checked out your own Arabic feeds? I hope you know we read those too\". In Arabic, the Muslim Brotherhood Twitter account and official website had been praising protests taking place by the US embassy, even publishing an article on the website entitled Egyptians rise to defend the Prophet.\nIn April 2013, a similar situation occurred in the aftermath of the Boston Bombings. Ikhwanweb, the official English website of the Muslim Brotherhood, strongly condemned the bombings and offered its condolences to the American people. However, the vice-chairman of the Freedom and Justice Party, Isam al-Iryan, posted a slightly different take on the events on his personal Arabic language Facebook page.\nWhile he described the attacks as \"criminal\", he insisted that \"our sympathy with the families of the victims, and the American people do not stop us from reading into the grave incident.\" He went on to raise suspicions over recent global developments, saying that these bombings followed a \"series of events\" that include the French intervention in Mali, increased violence in Syria, Iraq and Somalia and ponders: \"Who disturbed democratic transformations, despite the difficult transition from despotism, corruption, poverty, hatred, and intolerance to freedom, justice tolerance, development, human dignity, and social justice?

Forget about watching movies on the go!\nThe cloud is only making things easier and at the same time more difficult.\nServices like Sugarsync, Evernote and Zoho have given us the ability to carry documents, photographs, video and audio anywhere we go on any device.\nBut it only works well if you have wireless access when you need it.\nAnd there is nothing more frustrating than going into the bowels of the New York subway system for example, which is devoid of any wi-fi signals, and spending a 45-minute commute wishing you'd remembered to sync devices before you left home.\nSomehow it's even worse to go to the airport in plenty of time for a long haul flight and find out the cost of logging on for a few minutes to download an e-book can be almost the same as a monthly internet bill at home, that includes endless downloading of songs and videos.\nAt some point surely, wi-fi will be considered as an essential. Many hotels still charge $15 - $20 a day for what is often excruciatingly slow internet connectivity.\nWhy don't they charge for electricity in the room, or water for shaving, or even a fee for using the lifts rather than the stairs? Shouldn't wi-fi come as standard?\nBut wi-fi providers are constantly trying to catch up.\nJust one new product like Apple's iPhone 4S can cause major headaches within hours of its release.\nInstead of sending photos that were 1MB each, owners suddenly want to send upgraded photos that are 3 or 4MB each. Not to mention new services like Siri (voice recognition software) that also adds to the daily data stream.\nIf you want to witness wi-fi tested to the maximum, then you need to visit a huge technology convention like the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, where every year an event called \"Showstoppers\" is held in a huge hotel.\nScores of the best known technology companies in the US are trying to demo their latest products, which often rely on a fast connection. Watching are hundreds of journalists who are kitted out with laptops to blog video and photos from the room.\nWi-fi installation expert Alex Pournelle, from Location Connect, is pacing up and down the aisles, with an unusual looking laptop that is crammed with radio receivers of different types sticking up, that measure readings from the room.\nHe speaks bluntly after watching all the usage bars on his screen stay at 100% for hours.\n\"Wifi is a victim of its own success. People expect to have infinite bits wherever they go.\n\"For what most people think of as wi-fi there are really only three channels to share, and everyone keeps bumping into everybody else. It's like screaming across a room. If enough people do it, eventually no-one can be heard\".\nIt's like this in lots of places at CES, as the concentration of connected devices moves around. Ironically, it can be almost impossible to communicate at times during what is supposed to be the premiere trade convention in the world for new technology.\nAlex thinks there needs to be a new social awareness from people who carry the latest gadgets everywhere with them.\n\"Instead of just \"please turn off your cell phone\" it should be \"please turn off your radio (wi-fi receiver)\", he says.\n\"You are silencing the device, but in a different way. (Wi-fi) is very, very shared so there is a certain amount that can only be done by getting people to turn off their devices.\"\nThe problem is that the newest devices feature data intense apps that are permanently updating, fetching new information or syncing without any prompt from the owner.\nAnd on top of that, people expect to be able to update Facebook whenever they want to, or carry out multiple text chats complete with photographic illustrations, or take part in live video streaming conversations with relatives around the world. It used to be that email would do.\nMcCarran International Airport in Las Vegas decided long ago that having a decent wi-fi service was a top priority, because they saw an ever-increasing flow of tech-savvy travellers coming to conventions in the city.\n\"We've seen a drastic change in the number of people and devices in the airport space,\" says Samuel Ingalls, assistant director of aviation information systems at McCarran Airport.\n\"We have about 70,000 individual users per week. This year I would not be surprised if we broke our record of 2,000 simultaneous connections\".\nA dedicated engineer on staff monitors signals in every part of the complex continuously, and will even go out and investigate new devices being used in the terminals if the user is having problems.\nThere are plenty of locations, most notably hotels that shy away from good quality wifi service.\nIn Las Vegas, in-room internet was originally met with scepticism - casino bosses distrusted any technology that would keep potential gamblers away from the slot machines and tables.\nBut that has changed too in recent years. Caesar's Palace is building hidden wi-fi terminals into the structure of its newest tower.\nIt was one of the first considerations when architects were designing interior plans. In the meantime many existing suites now come with personal wi-fi routers.\nInstead of ignoring or downplaying wi-fi, Caesar's has embraced it, acknowledging that visitors turn up with devices that need to be connected.\nIt has produced its own iPad app from which customers can book shows, order food, have supplies for the room delivered or contact the car valet a few minutes before reaching the lobby.\nUnfortunately for the rest of us that travel in the US at least, it doesn't look as though the overall situation will get better any time soon.\nThe newest 4G networks are fast but have caps.\nMeanwhile file sizes keep going up, cloud services keep expanding and more people want to watch more movies in more places.", "summary": "Many business travellers would agree that going without wi-fi for any length of time is becoming more and more painful.", "id": "16858088", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe newest 4G networks are fast but have caps.

The new West Link has been designed to ease city centre congestion and travel to the A82, while the planned East Link would connect the A96 to the A9.\nA flyover to take traffic up and over the Longman Roundabout at the Kessock Bridge could also be allocated money, said Ms Davidson.\nShe added that funding would also be directed towards improving the region's internet connections.\nThe Plan in the High Castle: Where the money is to be invested\nMs Davidson said: \"What everyone, every community, is telling me is digital connectivity is what we are needing.\n\"That would penetrate every corner of the Highlands and we want the Highlands to be the best connected region in Europe.\"\nThe council leader confirmed that \u00a315m had been sought for a project to transform Inverness Castle, currently a sheriff court, into a tourist attraction.\nMP Mr Hendry said: \"This deal offers us an opportunity to not only boost the economy and bring jobs, it allows us to plan growth, develop our vision and deliver for the people who live and work here.\n\"It is no secret that almost everyone in Inverness wants to see the castle open to the public. This will bring thousands of extra tourists and will significantly boost our tourism economy. It is a win for local people and visitors.\"\nHe added: \"These infrastructure improvements, combined with the dualling of the A9, A96, improvements to the rail services and the SG commitment to 100% broadband coverage mean we will be better planned for, better connected and better able to take advantage of opportunities in the future.\"\nEconomist Mr Mackay said there was merit in some of the projects proposed, but described other ideas as \"poor\".\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland that turning Inverness Castle into a tourist attraction and improving roads would bring much-needed economic benefits.\nBut he added that money should also be invested in putting new businesses into empty shops in the city centre. Mr Mackay described building a velodrome, which had formed part of Highland Council's original investment plans, as a \"waste of money\".\nHighland Council has since said a regional sports hub in Inverness did not form part of the City Region Deal.\nThe local authority said it would consider how to progress the plan and had an \"indication of significant investment\" from national body sportscotland.\nThe council had suggested the hub could have a velodrome and space for sports including gymnastics.\nMSP Mr Gibson said some of the investment should have been committed to resolving a problematic section of the A890 in Wester Ross.\nHe said: \"How can it be a city and region deal if the need for a bypass at Strome Ferry on the rock-fall prone section of the A890 is not a priority?\n\"Following a series of land slips and rock falls over decades the frequent closure of this A road which is a Highland Council responsibility could pose life and death issues for travellers.\n\"The school students going to Plockton High School from Lochcarron are exposed to danger every day. Keeping the dangerous section open has cost millions over decades.\"\nCity of Angles\nBy Steven McKenzie, BBC Highlands and Islands reporter\nAsk anyone in Inverness and they will have a different angle on how hundreds of millions of pounds should be spent on the city.\nThere is support for the greater availability of sporting facilities because of the huge demand for what is already on offer at sites such as Inverness Leisure and Culloden Community Centre.\nAnd while a traffic jam in Inverness is usually nothing like what can be experienced in Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen, it is the cause of frustration, especially at the Longman Roundabout, the octopus tentacle-esq Inshes Roundabout and Raigmore Interchange.\nBut the West Link, one of Highland Council's solutions to the traffic problems, has been controversial with a campaign opposed to the loss of green spaces to the new road.\nBetter digital connectivity would likely receive wide spread support with the most vocal support coming from places beyond Inverness. Highland Council's leader Margaret Davidson has said the whole of the Highlands would benefit from investment in improved broadband connections.\nWherever the millions of pounds is eventually committed it will be the cause of agreement and disagreement.\nSimilar deals have previously been secured by Glasgow and jointly by Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire councils.\nThe Scottish and UK governments provide funding and other support for the packages.\nHighland Council said millions of pounds it has committed to building Inverness's new West Link road would form part of the deal.\nThe local authority said the package would benefit the wider Highland area.\nDuring last week's Budget, Chancellor George Osborne said that negotiations would also begin on the Edinburgh and South-East Scotland City Region Deal bid\nIt aims to secure major funding to help better protect historic attractions in Scotland's capital, and also boost the wider area's overseas trade and opportunities for

The sun burns.\n\"Don't go any nearer, otherwise you'll disturb the bees' movement, and they may sting you,\" beekeeper Khairi Kharroubi warns.\nWe are in the middle of the countryside in the Siliana province of Tunisia, a two-hour drive south west of capital Tunis.\nKhairi, 24, and two other beekeepers are proudly showing some visitors their hives.\nThe three men are the first participants in a new social enterprise project called TuniBee, which is run by students at the Mediterranean School of Business (MSB) in Tunis.\nUnder the scheme, people with beekeeping experience are selected from deprived areas of the country.\nMoney from TuniBee's sponsors is then used to buy those taking part additional beehives. The beekeepers are also given training and guidance to produce better quality and larger amounts of honey.\nEach hive costs 200 Tunisian dinars ($91; \u00c2\u00a369), and in return sponsors get 1.5kg of honey a year for a period of three years.\nThis is just over one-third of the current average annual production of a Tunisian hive, and 1.5kg of good quality Tunisian honey costs between 30 and 45 dinars.\nThe beekeepers get to keep the remainder of the honey during the three years, and after that period, the hive, and all its future honey production, is theirs to keep.\nThe idea for TuniBee came from Noomen Lahimer, professor of economics and entrepreneurship at the MSB, whose father keeps bees.\nProf Lahimer proposed it to his students, suggesting that they should set up and run the scheme as part of their studies.\n\"We immediately liked the idea,\" says MSB student Chaima Ben Romdhan, who is TuniBee's president.\n\"However, we didn't have any specialist expertise [of beekeeping].\"\nTo bring in the required beekeeping knowledge, Prof Lahimer put his students in touch with a Tunisian entrepreneur called Khaled Bouchoucha.\nMr Bouchoucha, who had previously been mentored by Prof Lahimer in a competition for start-up companies in 2013, runs a business that specialises in helping beekeepers increase honey production.\nHis company, Iris Technology, has developed a beehive with a camera attached to monitor the movement of the bees. The hive is also fitted with a GPS tracker to try to deter theft - which is a growing problem in Tunisia.\nIn addition, the hives are fitted with a monitor that measures temperatures and humidity. If anything goes wrong, the beekeepers are sent a text message so that they can react as quickly as possible.\nMr Bouchoucha agreed to come on board and provide the beehives at cost price, and offer his company's technical support.\nHe has been joined by Hidhli Naoufel, a veterinarian who specialises in bees. Mr Naoufel has been training the participating beekeepers in best practice.\n\"Expertise is often lacking, and incorrect practices are adopted from generation to generation,\" says Mr Naoufel.\nOne example of bad practice Mr Naofel is preventing is bees being fed sugar. This increases a hive's production, but results in a bland honey lacking the flavours you get if the bees are required to harvest various nectars.\nTuniBee currently has 24 sponsors, including parents and relatives of the students helping to run the scheme, and MSB staff.\nRecently some of the sponsors joined the students on a coach trip from Tunis to the village of Kesra, in Siliana province, to meet the first three TuniBee participants and see their hives.\nMohamed Jouini, 32, says he was very pleased to have been chosen to take part.\nAn electrician, he says he needs to keep bees to make extra money: \"The current economic situation in Tunisia makes it hard to survive with just one job.\"\nAbdelfatteh Sayari, 38, has his TuniBee hives nearby. A mapmaker by trade, he started keeping bees as a hobby 10 years ago, keen to restart a family tradition.\nHe says: \"My grandmother kept bees in the traditional way - in trees - but nobody took over from her when she passed away.\"\nFellow TuniBee participant Khairi Kharroubi has been helping his father look after bees since he was 12. He is currently doing a degree in business administration, so selling honey brings in vital money.\nOne of the sponsors who travelled to Kesra to see the bees is Salwa Battikh. A retired English teacher, the 50-year-old is the aunt of one of the students helping to run TuniBee.\nShe says: \"I like the idea, it is something new and I hope it will succeed, because it is so hard to find good honey.\"\nLike many Tunisians she usually buys her honey direct from beekeepers in the hope of getting better quality for a lower price than that available in supermarkets.\nMs Battikh adds that she hopes the scheme will encourage more people to go into beekeeping.\nAnother sponsor, the MSB's vice dean, Leila Triki, is hopeful that TuniBee can help alleviate poverty in the Tunisian countryside.\nThe intention is for the scheme to be expanded, including sponsoring a number of female beekeepers. TuniBee is also looking to bring on some corporate sponsors, with oil firms Total and Shell and computer giant Microsoft showing an interest.\nExport sales are also being explored, with the students from TuniBee having already found one US company interested in importing Tunisian honey.\nCurrently Tunisia has 12,000 beekeepers who look after 256,000 hives, according to estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture. About 80% of those looking after bees do so to supplement their income from other work.\nThe hope is that the beekeeping skills the TuniBee programme teaches will enable beekeepers to increase production.\nPresently the average amount of honey produced each year by a Tunisian hive is just 4kg, compared with 13.6kg in the UK and 34kg in Germany.\nEconomist Mehdi Ben Braham of the University of Carthage in Tunis says TuniBee is an \"interesting project\".\n\"This kind of project could have a significant socio-economic impact in deprived areas, by giving hope and creating sustainable jobs, and providing sufficient financial resources to reduce poverty.\"", "summary": "Bees buzz between the blue and white painted hives.", "id": "36702997", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "Tunisia is a country in North Africa.

They also discuss politics. And these days, there is a lot to discuss.\nOn the day I visited the village head's house - with a giant-sized poster of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in ceremonial robes covering one wall - there was a heated discussion about the comments being made by the anti-government protest movement in Bangkok, in particular the call for the entire Shinawatra family to be forced to leave the country - a call that at one point had reduced Ms Yingluck to tears.\nThe villagers were outraged by this, and were considering all changing their names to Shinawatra in solidarity.\nThey were also feeling aggrieved by the common refrain among the protesters that the people of Isaan, as the north-east is known, are too uneducated to know what they are voting for.\n\"Well, I know they have more education than me,\" said one old woman, who told me she had left school at the age of 10.\n\"But at least I understand what democracy is. Those people in Bangkok, who have been to university or studied overseas, how come they don't understand democracy?\"\nThroughout the recent crisis in Bangkok, the red shirts have been almost invisible.\nThat is partly because their leaders did not want to risk a confrontation with the protest movement which might prompt military intervention, and partly because their own movement has become factionalised and hard to mobilise from across rural Thailand.\nPeople in the north-east repeatedly expressed frustration that they had to stay put, and watch the Bangkok protesters trying to overthrow the government they elected.\nThe loudest complaint I heard was about the allegation that the red shirts had been bought by the governing party.\nThey were insulted by the notion that a few banknotes handed out during election time could induce them to give years of unwavering loyalty to Thaksin Shinawatra, and now his sister, Ms Yingluck.\nBut what about the more sophisticated allegation that they had been bought by populist policies?\nAt a rice mill in Udon Thani, farmers had started queuing from the early hours of the morning to sell their harvest.\nIt's an annual ritual that begins with their trucks being weighed, samples of rice taken to assess moisture content, and then the sacks are opened, and the rice poured onto the growing mountains of grain stored at the mill.\nIn the past, they could never be sure what price they would get. Today, they are guaranteed a very generous price by the government.\n\"It means we have money left over to spend,\" farmer Daoruang Sinthuwapee told me. \"We have enough to school our children, and more for the family. We never had this kind of help before.\"\nBut there was some uncertainty over when the farmers would be paid.\nThe Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, which makes the payments, has been unable to raise enough funds on the bond market this year to cover the huge cost of the scheme.\nIn other parts of Thailand, farmers have started protesting over late payments.\nThe benefits of the rice scheme may ensure most farmers in the north-east vote for the governing party in the February election. But many economists expect the scheme to collapse, because the massive rice stocks cannot be sold on the international market for the price the government paid.\nIt could backfire badly on the prime minister.\nHer decision to raise the minimum wage is also popular with workers. But not with factory owner Pornthep Saksujarit.\nHe employs 400 people at his plant, making sensors and other electronic components for cars and cameras. It is the kind of investment that is helping the north-east move away from dependence on agriculture.\nHe told me the sudden rise in the minimum wage, to 300 Baht ($9; \u00c2\u00a36) a day, squeezed his margins to the point where he has had to stop workers from doing overtime.\n\"We would like help from the government, with infrastructure, or cutting taxes or the price of utilities,\" he said.\n\"But next time they want to raise the minimum wage, please do it gradually.\"\nThe verdict on Prime Minister Yingluck's populist policies will certainly be a lot harsher than on her brother's, from his time in office, which are still widely praised, even by his opponents, and are the ones most often cited by his supporters to explain their loyalty; the low-cost healthcare scheme, and the micro-credit Village Fund.\nPlern Thienyim is a passionate red shirt supporter, but she wasn't always.\n\"Until Thaksin came along, we always voted for the Democrat party,\" she told me. \"Even when Thaksin was campaigning for the first time and making all these promises, we didn't believe him.\"\nShe was working in a textile factory at the time. Then she borrowed from the Village Fund to start a small tailoring business, which she has gradually expanded. No other prime minister had ever given her an opportunity like that, she said.\nSo in April 2010 she and her brother Wasan joined the red shirt protests in Bangkok, against the then-Democrat government. Wasan was killed by a shot to the head in the first armed clashes with the army.\nShe is bitter about what she sees as the different treatment given to protesters from her side, and those now in Bangkok, and the attempts to depose the government she voted for.\nThat sense of injustice is driving even sceptical red shirts to stand by their party, and put aside the reservations some of them have about the continuing influence of Thaksin Shinawatra, and some of the government's policies.\n\"We won't accept another coup, like in the old days,\" said Khamsaen Chaithep, wife of the village chief in Nhong Huu Ling.\n\"We will fight to keep the government we elected.\"\n\"And if the military tries a coup again, we are ready to come out, to die for democracy.\"", "summary": "The village of Nhong Huu Ling is an unremarkable rural community in north-eastern Thailand.", "id": "25426248", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1.

The animal is worshipped and decorated during festivals; holy men take around cows, with their foreheads smeared in vermillion, to seek alms.\nThere is even a journal called Indian Cow; and a Love 4 Cow Trust to \"propagate and promote love\" for cows. A right-wing Hindu organisation has actually launched cosmetics using cow urine and dung.\nThe cud-chewing, sedentary bovine also provides fodder for humour. A hugely popular - and possibly apocryphal - story relates to an essay on the animal by a civil service aspirant. \"The cow is a successful animal,\" it began. \"Also he is quadruped, and because he is female, he give milk, but will do so when he is got child. He is same like God, sacred to Hindus and useful to man. But he has got four legs together. Two are forward and two are afterwards.\"\nBut let's not digress.\nMore seriously, most states forbid cow slaughter, and the ban on beef has been criticised by many because the meat is cheaper than chicken and fish and is a staple for the poorer Muslim, tribal and dalit (formerly untouchable) communities.\nNot surprisingly, the cow is also India's most polarising - and political - animal.\nLast month, a 50-year-old man in northern Uttar Pradesh was killed in a mob lynching over rumours that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence over the killing nearly two weeks later, members of his party thrashed an independent lawmaker in Kashmir for hosting a beef party.\nEarlier this month, Hindus and Muslims clashed over rumours, again, of cow slaughter in Uttar Pradesh. A row over banning beef is threatening to stoke religious tensions in restive Kashmir.\nWhile campaigning for his party in the crucial state elections in Bihar state, Mr Modi ridiculed a regional rival for saying many Hindus eat beef.\nThere are worrying reports that supporters of the BJP and right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the state have launched a virulent campaign against cow slaughter and beef.\nAlthough the government's own animal census shows that the cow and buffalo population has grown - a 6.75% increase between 2007 and 2012 -  and cow slaughter is banned in most states, there is hysteria being whipped up that the bovine is under threat.\nVigilante cow protection groups have mushroomed. They claim to have a strong network of informers and say they \"feel empowered\" because of the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP government in Delhi. One of these groups actually managed to get a court order against a beef and pork festival at a Delhi university in 2012.\nThat's not all. The BJP-ruled state of Rajasthan has a cow minister. There are campaigns going on demanding that the cow should replace the tiger as the national animal - a minister in Haryana, also ruled by the BJP, promptly began an online poll.\nMr Modi must partly share the blame for whipping up the unfounded and perilous frenzy over cow slaughter. On the general election campaign trail last year, he accused the Congress government of promoting a \"pink revolution\" - slaughtering cows and exporting meat for money. \"Should we feel proud of this endeavour of the UPA government led by Congress, which is founded on the killing of our mother cow?\" he wrote in a blog in 2012. It's another matter that under Mr Modi, India continues to be the world's largest exporter of beef - 80% of it buffalo meat.\nBut historian Mukul Kesavan sees one argument offered for cow protection as \"just a belligerent assertion\".\n\"It goes like this: I am a Hindu, the cow is my mother, and I won't have her killed. What's being invoked here isn't morality or sentimentality or chivalry or economics: this is an assertion of fictive kinship that effectively argues that all cows are Hindu women.\"\nThis is not the first time the cow has become mixed up with politics.\nThe first organised Hindu cow protection movement was launched by a Sikh sect in Punjab in about 1870. In 1882, Hindu religious leader Dayananda Saraswati founded the first cow protection committee. \"It made the animal a symbol of the unity of a wide-ranging people, challenged the Muslim practice of its slaughter and provoked a series of serious communal riots in the 1880s and 1890s,\" says historian DN Jha.\nConflicts over cow slaughter often sparked religious riots that led to the killing of more than 100 people in 1893 alone. In 1966, at least eight people died in riots outside the parliament in Delhi while demanding a national ban on cow slaughter. And in 1979, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, considered by many as a spiritual heir of Mahatma Gandhi, went on a hunger strike to ban cow slaughter.\nThe \"holiness of the cow\" is also a myth, argues Dr Jha. In his masterly work The Myth of the Holy Cow, Dr Jha cites religious scriptures and ancient texts to show that Hindus did consume beef in ancient India. This flew against the Hindu right-wing assertion that beef-eating arrived in India with the coming of Islam. (Not surprisingly, he was threatened after the book was published in India.)\nAnd American academic Wendy Doniger correctly argues that Hindus \"do not always treat cows with respect or kindness; cows are sometimes beaten and frequently half starved\".\nIndia's most revered leader Mahatma Gandhi may also have been responsible for the Hindu veneration of the cow. He once said that the \"central fact of Hinduism is cow protection\", and spoke about the \"idea of penance and self-sacrifice for the martyred innocence\" it embodied. Today, in an ironical twist, the Hindu radicals seem to have hijacked the cow, and all it stands for.", "summary": "Why do Indians love cows so much?", "id": "34513185", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe cow is a sacred animal for the majority Hindu community, and they amble unmolested in traffic-choked streets.

because Zika is difficult to diagnose - it can be late in a pregnancy before expectant mothers are informed of the risk, if they are informed at all.\nZika: What you need to know\n'The worst day of my life'\nWork on a vaccine only began a few months ago but the scientists in Galveston say they are not starting from scratch.\nZika is a member of the flavivirus family, which includes the viruses which cause dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile disease, and the team intends to use existing vaccines for those conditions as a platform for its work.\nNikos Vasilakis, an assistant professor in the university's pathology department who works in the Centre for Biodefence and Emerging Infectious Diseases in Galveston, said they could have a vaccine ready for testing within a year or two, although he warned that winning approval from regulators could take much longer.\n\"What would take the longest time would be the process of passing it through the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and other regulatory agencies to allow it for public use and that may take up to 10 to 12 years,\" said Prof Vasilakis.\nVaccine research is also going on in Brazil, where scientists say one could be ready in five years.\nScientist Shannan Rossi has recently returned from Brazil with Prof Vasilakis where they saw the devastating effects of the virus first hand.\nShe is now inspecting samples of human and animal tissue as well as studying mosquitoes to answer a number of questions such as which animals it infects and how long it stays in humans.\n\"Right now we're really at the beginning stages,\" said Dr Rossi.\nIn the meantime, the worry is that the disease will continue to spread.\n\"It's now in our doorstep in Mexico,\" said Prof Vasilakis, who is based on Galveston Island which looks out across the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"About 25 to 30 million people are at risk of exposure here in the southern United States if we have a local transmission of Zika,\" he added.\nBy this he means not just that humans arrive in the US with Zika, which has already happened in several states including Texas, but that they are then bitten by a mosquito which can carry the disease on to other people.\n\"The biggest traffickers of viruses globally are infected humans,\" he said, adding that the majority of infected people do not show any symptoms of the disease, making it difficult to detect.\nIn the absence of a vaccine or treatment, the best way to reduce the risk of infection, says the Texan team, is to use insect repellent and fumigate homes to get rid of mosquitoes.\nCombating infection will be easier in the United States than in poorer countries, they say, because of the widespread use of air conditioning and window screens, which means mosquitoes are less likely to come into contact with human skin.\nWorking with insects which can carry such a dangerous virus is not without risks.\nDeep inside the University of Texas Medical Branch building, the mosquitoes which are deliberately infected with Zika and other viruses so they can be studied are kept in a secure facility, inside cages, behind screens and double air-locked doors.\nProf Saravana Thangamani is the director of the Insectary Services Core.\n\"In this insectary we keep about 23 different strains of mosquitoes for all researchers within our campus and we have Aedis Egypti from 12 different countries,\" he said.\nAedes Aegypti is the main species of mosquito which passes the virus from person to person, according to researchers.\nUnlike mosquitoes which spread malaria it is mostly active during the day and is found in countries throughout the Americas, except for Canada and Chile where it is too cold for it to survive.\nProf Scott Weaver described the disease as frightening people in countries across Latin America and the Caribbean.\nSo were they right to be frightened, especially pregnant women?\n\"Absolutely,\" answers Prof Weaver, without hesitation. \"If I had a daughter of child-bearing age who was planning a spring break vacation to the Caribbean in the next few months I would strongly urge her not to go there at this point.\"\nSadly for millions of women living in the infected countries, that is not an option.", "summary": "American scientists studying the Zika virus have warned that it could be a decade before a vaccine is publicly available.", "id": "35423288", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n1.
