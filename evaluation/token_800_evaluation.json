[{"document": "That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.\nThe hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.\nThis suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.\nThis argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.\nNonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.\n\"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.\nThey then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.\n\"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,\" Mr Hsiung explained.\nGiven that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated \"the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this\".\nThe answer? \"Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.\"\nWhat is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.\nThe team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.\nThey used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a \"structural colour\" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.\nThe results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.\n\"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,\" Mr Hsiung said.\n\"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.\"\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\" Mr Hsiung said. \"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\"\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n\"We don't know yet,\" Mr Hsiung said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter", "summary": "Tarantulas have evolved almost exactly the same shade of vibrant blue at least eight separate times.", "id": "34944735", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe blue color of tarantulas is not a sexual signal, but a warning color.\nThe blue color of tarantulas is not a sexual signal, but a warning color.

But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\nHe said: \"I think it's stunning!

partly because the Chinese characters of its scientific name mean \"Heaven's movement\" but also because the scientists are fans of Star Wars.\nThe study is published in the American Journal of Primatology.\nDr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, who was part of the team studying the apes, told BBC News: \"In this area, so many species have declined or gone extinct because of habitat loss, hunting and general human overpopulation.\n\"So it's an absolute privilege to see something as special and as rare as a gibbon in a canopy in a Chinese rainforest, and especially when it turns out that the gibbons are actually a new species previously unrecognised by science.\"\nHoolock gibbons are found in Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar. They spend most of their time living in the treetops, swinging through the forests with their forelimbs, rarely spending any time on the ground.\nBut the research team - led by Fan Peng-Fei from Sun Yat-sen University in China - started to suspect that the animals they were studying in China's Yunnan Province were unusual.\nAll hoolock gibbons have white eyebrows and some have white beards - but the Chinese primates' markings differed in appearance.\nTheir songs, which they use to bond with other gibbons and to mark out their territory, also had an unusual ring.\nSo the team carried out a full physical and genetic comparison with other gibbons, which confirmed that the primates were indeed a different species.\nThey have been given the scientific name of Hoolock tianxing - but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films.\nDr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy.\n\"It's difficult to get into the reserve. You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged.\n\"Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy.\n\"And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons.\"\nThe researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown.\nThe team warns that the primates are at risk of extinction.\n\"The low number of surviving animals and the threat they face from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and hunting means we think they should be classified as an endangered species,\" said Dr Turvey.\nIn response to the news, actor Mark Hamill - the original Luke Skywalker - said on Twitter that he was so proud to have a new jungle Jedi named after his character.\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter.", "summary": "A gibbon living in the tropical forests of south west China is a new species of primate, scientists have concluded.", "id": "38576819", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Skywalker hoolock gibbon is a new species of gibbon found in China.\nThe Skywalker hoolock gibbon is a new species of gibbon found in China.

But that doesn't mean I'm not Japanese.\"\nShe credited her win to Ms Miyamoto, saying she had helped show \"mixed girls the way\".\n\"Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan,\" said Ms Yoshikawa. \"That's what I thought too. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and all mixed girls the way.\n\"I know a lot of people who are haafu and suffer,\" she said. \"When I came back to Japan, everyone thought I was a germ.\"\n\"Like if they touched me they would be touching something bad. But I'm thankful because that made me really strong.\"\nA few years ago, a woman of Indian descent, Nina Davuluri, faced Twitter abuse after being crowned Miss America. Some called her an \"Arab\", some a \"terrorist\", and some an \"Arab terrorist\". Indians, in large numbers, came to her defence.\nNow, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to \"get over it\". One Twitter user said she won because she \"must have deserved it\" while another said \"after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan\".\nIn Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the \"lack of purity\". But some are wondering whether this debate over purity has any relevance in today's globalised world.\nAs one Twitter user said: \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, colour, gender or country of origin.\"\nThe pageant winner, also an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, said that she hoped to change perceptions.\n\"When I'm abroad, people never ask me what mix I am. As Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too.\"\nMs Yoshikawa's win did not trigger the backlash that Ms Miyamoto received on social media.\nThere were however, several on Twitter that expressed unhappiness.\n\"It's like we're saying a pure Japanese face can't be a winner,\" said one user.\n\"What's the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics,\" another complained.\nMs Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her.\n\"There was a time as a kid when I was confused about my identity,\" she said. \"But I've lived in Japan so long now I feel Japanese.\"", "summary": "A half-Indian woman has been crowned Miss World Japan, the second year in a row a biracial person has won a beauty pageant in the country.", "id": "37283518", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

being treated at The Priory in Altrincham.\nShe was released in December 2015 and later died after stepping in front of a train near Stockport.\nA lack of support available to her family contributed to her death, Stockport Coroner's Court heard.\nThe jury returned a conclusion of suicide but found the care plan when Ms McManus was discharged was inadequate and there was not enough communication with the family about her suicide risk.\nInadequate community care and specialist support and a lack of cohesiveness amongst agencies were also contributory factors to her death, the court heard.\nSpeaking after the conclusion, her mother Marie said there should have been more help available and \"too many of our children are dying from this terrible illness\".\n\"Effective treatment is needed more quickly and if this had been available to our beautiful daughter, maybe she would still be alive today, maybe we would not have needed this inquest,\" she said.\nPaula Stanford, hospital director at The Priory, said: \"Our heartfelt sympathies are with Pip's family and we will now carefully consider the findings of the jury.\"\nDuring the inquest, the hospital said her anorexia was one of the most severe cases it had seen.\nThe coroner, Andrew Bridgman, said he will write to all of the agencies involved in her care.\nThe inquest heard Ms McManus had a history of self-harming and had previously written a number of goodbye notes to her family, doctor, and The Priory hospital.\nBy the age of 13, she had been diagnosed with severe anorexia and was obsessed with diet and exercise and in September 2014, was sectioned and treated at The Priory.\nShe was released in December 2015, by which time she was not considered high risk, though she remained under hospital care.\nBut following a family row five days later, the teenager walked to Gatley train station near her home and killed herself.\nHer father, Jim, said his daughter's anorexia \"had too strong of a grip.\"\n\"She used to say she had bad thoughts and wasn't allowed to do things - she couldn't even lick an ice-cream. She'd turn around and say I'm not allowed.\n\"Whatever was going on in her head was so strong she just couldn't comply.\"\nHer mother, Marie, said it \"was just horrific\" and \"a nightmare.\"\n\"[Pippa] hated herself. She thought she was the ugliest person in the world. Whatever you said, it didn't make a difference because that's what the anorexia was telling her.\n\"We needed some trained mental health workers to work with us but they weren't there to do that... We were let down by everybody I think.

He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances.\n\"I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and exceed it.\"\nThat, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity.\n\"In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which.\"\nSo, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.\nActually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.\nLong before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.\nAnother speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.\nShe told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.\nHer concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. \"I'm scared of that,\" she said.\nAfter decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.\nJust one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.\nRead more of the BBC's AI coverage here.", "summary": "Two years ago Stephen Hawking told the BBC that the development of full artificial intelligence, could spell the end of the human race.", "id": "37713629", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "1.

All the patients stayed on their usual medication.\nAs expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable.\nAnd three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.\nProf Foltynie told the BBC News website: \"This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect.\n\"It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease.\n\"We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.\"\nThey also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time.\nAn effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients.\nParkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was \"trivial\" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers.\nThe drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1.\nThose sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive.\nIt is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.\nDavid Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: \"The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - \u00e2\u20ac\u0160something no current treatment can do.\n\"Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.\"\nDr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: \"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\"", "summary": "It may be possible to stop the progression of Parkinson's disease with a drug normally used in type 2 diabetes, a clinical trial suggests.", "id": "40814250", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\"\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\"\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\"The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\"\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\"\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\"The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\"\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe drug is already used to treat diabetes.\nIt is thought to work by helping the brain cells to survive.\nThe drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.\n", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\"\n", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\"The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\"\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe drug is not a cure, but it is a treatment that can slow the progression of the disease.\nThe drug is not a cure, but it is a treatment that can slow the progression of the disease.

Normally firms use an IPO as an opportunity to make lots of cash.\nIn general, IPOs can also cost a fair chunk of money, and, crucially for Spotify, they can take a lot of time to set up.\nAn IPO needs an investment bank or banks to underwrite an issue of new stock. Underwriting often amounts to the bank buying new stock to resell after the company floats.\nThe bank also looks at the company as part of the process for setting a reasonable initial offer price for the shares. The underwriters \"build a book\" - that is, they go to institutional investors to gauge the appetite for the shares in the company that's going to be floated. Fund managers say how many shares they want and the price they would be willing to pay, and the level of this demand is one of the factors used to set the initial offer price.\nAll of this to-ing and fro-ing eats up cash and time - and for Spotify, the clock is ticking.\nIn March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once they list.\nBut under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the shares are listed.\nSo as time ticks by, Spotify has to pay more to its creditors, and give them more of a discount on shares.\nAs well as being a faster process, direct listing also means fewer regulatory hurdles, and it helps keeps expectations about share prices in check.\nSpotify, which last year issued a $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3801m) convertible bond, was publicly valued at $8.5bn (\u00c2\u00a36.8bn) in 2015.\nThe Swedish firm was founded more than a decade ago and now has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nThis week it also signed a new long-term licensing deal with Universal Music Group, the world's largest record label.\nSpotify includes TPG and Goldman Sachs among its major investors.", "summary": "Spotify is reportedly considering an unconventional direct listing on a stock market that stops short of a full-blown initial public offering.", "id": "39523865", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.\nSpotify has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nSpotify has signed a new long-term licensing deal", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.\nSpotify has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nSpotify has signed a new long-term licensing deal", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.\nSpotify has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nSpotify has signed a new long-term licensing deal", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.\nSpotify has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nSpotify has signed a new long-term licensing deal", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.\nSpotify has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nSpotify has signed a new long-term licensing deal", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music for free, or pay a monthly subscription fee to access a wider range of music.\nSpotify is a publicly traded company, but it has not", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music for free, or pay a monthly subscription fee to access a wider range of music.\nSpotify has more than 50 million paying subscribers,", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand.

came close to equalising through Lukas Jutkiewicz and David Jones in the second half.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut Swansea withstood the pressure and, following last Saturday's first league win at Manchester United, are level on points with top-of-the-table Chelsea.\nDefeat for Burnley, meanwhile, leaves them still searching for a first Premier League point of the campaign, although their battling display will have been encouraging for manager Sean Dyche.\nSwansea boss Garry Monk named an unchanged team from the opening-day triumph at Old Trafford, with new signings Federico Fernandez and Tom Carroll left out of the squad.\nBurnley also stuck with the same side which lost 3-1 to Chelsea on Monday, although Stephen Ward was named on the bench after joining from Wolves.\nThe opening defeat by Chelsea was a chastening reintroduction to Premier League football for the Clarets, who were overwhelmed in midfield, and they were similarly outnumbered by Swansea.\nThe hosts stretched their opponents at every opportunity, with wingers Dyer and Wayne Routledge particularly threatening in the opening exchanges.\nRoutledge created early chances for Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson, but it was Dyer who opened the scoring.\nLatching on to Sigurdsson's through ball, Dyer scampered into the penalty area and shot low into the net despite a touch from Burnley keeper Heaton.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSwansea were well worth their lead and, apart from a swerving 20-yard shot from Burnley striker Danny Ings, Monk's men were not troubled during a comfortable first half.\nThey faced a reinvigorated Burnley side after the restart, however, and the visitors were close to equalising when Jutkiewicz headed narrowly over after an hour.\nJones then had a shot palmed wide by Lukasz Fabianski, while Swansea brought on summer signings Bafetimbi Gomis and Jefferson Montero for Bony and Dyer as they sought to regain the initiative.\nAlthough Gomis and Montero injected pace and urgency into the home attack, it was the Swansea defenders who were most influential in the closing moments.\nWith captain and centre-back Ashley Williams a steadying presence on his 30th birthday, the Swans repelled a flurry of late Burnley attacks to cling on to a second successive win and consign the Clarets to another defeat.\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"It's a fantastic start and great to have six points.\n\"It's the best start we could have had, but we know we are only two games from being on your back and

These ejecta strings form radial patterns that can be traced back to an obvious source.\nThe chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. They appear isolated.\nAnd, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. More seem to point north-south than east-west. If confirmed, this may say something about the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\"It could be that we're seeing the north-south ones more easily because of the direction of sunlight, but these are pretty big features - kind of hard to miss,\" explained Prof Rothery.\n\"If there are genuinely more catenae orientated north-south than east-west, it's suggesting that if they're produced by tidally disrupted comets then the comets that were hitting Mercury more than three billion years ago had orbits tilted at more or less ninety degrees to the plane of Mercury's orbit.\"\nThe idea is somewhat speculative at the moment, but fascinating nonetheless.\nAlthough the image stream from Messenger is about to end, the next probe to Mercury is already under construction.\nBepiColombo is a joint venture between the European and Japanese space agencies.\nIts mission will launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit in 2024. Prof Rothery is the lead co-investigator on Bepi's Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), which has been designed by a team at Leicester University.\nHe presented his and Fegan's catenae research at the recent European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "UK scientists are hunting for impact craters on Mercury that are likely to have been produced by disrupted comets.", "id": "32530125", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The Open University team is examining pictures returned from the US space agency's (Nasa) Messenger probe.

Senegal and Nigeria stood by.\nOverhead, a fighter jet from the West African force guaranteeing the new president's security performed fly-pasts.\n\"I am a happy man today,\" Mr Barrow told a reporter from the Associated Press in the crush at the airport, adding: \"I think the bad part is finished now.\"\nThe president said his priority was to appoint his cabinet and \"then get the ball rolling\".\nThe BBC's Umaru Fofana in Banjul said that thousands of people had tried to force their way into the airport to see Mr Barrow return and they burst into celebration as soon as his plane touched down.\nPresident Barrow was driven from the airport in a convoy of cars and waved to the crowds who lined the route.\nSupporter Ibrahima Gaye said Mr Barrow would be different from Mr Jammeh \"in all aspects\".\n\"We have been living under dictatorship for 22 years. You can go home at night and sleep without worrying you will be arrested before daybreak,\" he said.\nPresident Barrow is staying at his own home while a security assessment is carried out at the official residence, State House.\nMr Barrow was sworn in as president at the Gambian embassy in Senegal a week ago, but a public inauguration on home soil is planned soon, aides say.\nThe UN envoy for West Africa, Mohamed ibn Chambas, has said the UN will help guarantee security in The Gambia.\nSeveral thousand West African soldiers remain in The Gambia amid reports that rogue pro-Jammeh elements are embedded in the country's security forces.\nThe West African force had threatened to drive Mr Jammeh from office if he did not agree to go.\nThe new president has asked for the force to remain in The Gambia for six months.\nHis spokesman Halifa Sallah said an inauguration was being planned for the national stadium in Banjul. \"It will be an occasion to show strength. Everyone will be invited. The president will address his people,'' he told Senegalese radio.\nMr Jammeh, who was a 29-year-old army lieutenant when he came to power in a 1994 coup, had refused to accept the results of the December election.\nAfter his departure, reports emerged that more than $11m (\u00c2\u00a38.8m) had disappeared from The Gambia's state coffers.\nHowever a presidential adviser said the police had been asked to investigate and would determine if anything was missing.\nMr Jammeh has not commented on the allegations.\nIn other developments, parliament has cancelled the state of emergency declared by Mr Jammeh last week. It also revoked legislation that would have extended its life for a further 90 days.", "summary": "Gambia's President Adama Barrow has returned to the country to assume power - days after his predecessor Yahya Jammeh left to go into exile.", "id": "38755897", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia's parliament has voted to revoke a state of emergency declared by former President Yahya Jammeh.\nThe state of emergency was declared last week after Mr Jammeh refused to accept defeat in December", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia's parliament has voted to revoke a state of emergency declared by former President Yahya Jammeh.\nThe state of emergency was declared last week after Mr Jammeh refused to accept defeat in December", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia's parliament has voted to revoke a state of emergency declared by former President Yahya Jammeh.\nThe state of emergency was declared last week after Mr Jammeh refused to accept defeat in December", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Gambia's parliament has voted to revoke a state of emergency declared by former President Yahya Jammeh.\nThe measure was passed by 51 votes to 10, with one abstention.", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Gambia's parliament has voted to revoke a state of emergency declared by former President Yahya Jammeh.\nThe state of emergency was declared last week after Mr Jammeh refused to accept defeat in December", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\"The West African force had threatened to drive Mr Jammeh from office if he did not agree to go.

which is linked to higher socio-economic status and healthier lifestyles - protects the brain against dementia.\nThe researchers in this study examined the brains of 872 people who had been part of three large ageing studies.\nBefore their deaths they had also completed questionnaires about their education.\nThe researchers found that more education makes people better able to cope with changes in the brain associated with dementia.\nPost-mortems showed the pathology - signs of disease - in the brains of people with and without long educations were at similar levels.\nBut the researchers found those with more education are better able to compensate for the effects of the condition.\nIt also showed that, for each year spent in education, there was an 11% decreased risk of developing dementia.\nDr Hannah Keage of the University of Cambridge, who co-authored the study, said: \"Previous research has shown that there is not a one-to-one relationship between being diagnosed with dementia during life and changes seen in the brain at death.\n\"One person may show lots of pathology in their brain while another shows very little, yet both may have had dementia.\n\"Our study shows education in early life appears to enable some people to cope with a lot of changes in their brain before showing dementia symptoms.\"\nThe researchers used data from the Eclipse collaboration, which combines the three European population-based longitudinal studies of ageing from the UK and Finland which have assessed people for up to 20 years.\nProfessor Carol Brayne, who led the study, said: \"Education is known to be good for population health and equity.\n\"This study provides strong support for investment in early life factors which should have an impact on society and the whole lifespan.\n\"This is hugely relevant to policy decisions about the importance of resource allocation between health and education.\"\nRuth Sutherland, chief executive  of the Alzheimer's Society, said: \"This is the largest study ever to confirm that hitting the books could help you fight the symptoms of dementia in later life. What we don't know is why a longer education is so good for you.\n\"It could be that the types of people who study longer have large brains which adapt better to changes associated with dementia.\n\"Another reason could be that educated people find ways of managing or hiding their symptoms.\"\nShe added: \"We now need more research to find out why an education can make the brain more 'dementia resistant'.

But so far, these extrasolar satellites have lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques.\nDr David Kipping, assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University in New York, says he has spent \"most of his adult life\" looking for exomoons.\nFor the time being, however, he urged caution, saying: \"We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else.\"\nThe Kepler telescope hunts for planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front - known as a transit. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light.\nThe promising signal was observed during three transits - fewer than the astronomers would like to have in order to confidently announce a discovery.\nThe work by Dr Kipping, his Columbia colleague Alex Teachey and citizen scientist Allan R Schmitt, assigns a confidence level of four sigma to the signal from the distant planetary system. The confidence level describes how unlikely it is that an experimental result is simply down to chance. If you express it in terms of tossing a coin, it's equivalent to tossing 15 heads in row.\nBut Dr Kipping said this is not the best way to gauge the potential detection.\nHe told BBC News: \"We're excited about it... statistically, formally, it's a very high probability. But do we really trust the statistics? That's something unquantifiable.

formula for executive pay is constructed.\nThat vote is binding, so the board needs a majority of shareholders to vote in favour.\nSo, in the case of Weir, the board of directors will have to come up

for the CEO (chief executive), particularly given that his overall bonus potential is more than 10 times his basic salary and his total remuneration was over $21m last year,\" said Hans-Christoph Hirt, co-head of Hermes equity ownership.\n\"We believe that an incremental approach to salary rises is more appropriate and should reflect shareholder value creation over the longer term,\" he

Nurofen.\nEarlier, WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell was forced to defend his pay package, worth up to \u00a370m.\nHe said his pay was based on the performance of WPP, the world's largest

executive Bob Dudley, that would have netted him \u00a314m.\nThe vote against the increase was non-binding, but BP's chairman said at the annual meeting that the sentiment would be reflected in future pay deals.\nThat was a \"remarkable\" moment according to Stefan Stern, a director at the High Pay Centre, a think tank which monitors executive salaries.\n\"I do think there is a feeling that things have been getting out of hand,\" he said.\n\"Shareholders have signed off on pay structures they didn't understand and now we're seeing buyer's remorse,\" he added.\nLast week a group that includes some of Britain's most high-profile bosses said that executive pay in the UK is \"not fit for purpose\" and needs reform.\nThe Executive Remuneration Working Group said there was \"widespread scepticism and loss of public confidence\" over executive pay.\nSainsbury's chairman David Tyler and Legal & General chief executive Nigel Wilson worked on the interim report.\nAlso last week, Anglo

But in a tweet earlier this month, President Donald Trump said China's actions had \"not worked out\".\nThe sanctions mean that the Bank of Dandong will be barred from doing business in the US.\nThe US Treasury said it had been \"a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity\" and facilitated \"millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea's WMD (weapons of mass destruction) and ballistic missile programmes\".\nTwo Chinese nationals accused of creating front companies for North Korean entities have also been blacklisted, as has a shipping company, Dalian Global Unity Shipping, that is accused of smuggling luxury goods to North Korea.\nMr Mnuchin said that the US could impose more sanctions in the future.\nThe sanctions were announced as new South Korean President Moon Jae-in held talks with President Trump in Washington.\nMr Trump said \"many options\" were being discussed on the North Korea issue.\n\"The era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed, many years it has failed.

Geological instabilities cause around 1,000 tremors each year.\nMany of the small ones go undetected by the public, and residents are used to taking medium-sized quakes in their stride.\nSome earthquakes, however, are etched in the national consciousness.\nIn 1923 a huge earthquake struck Tokyo. Known as the Great Kanto Earthquake, the 7.9 magnitude tremor and subsequent fires that blazed through wooden houses killed around 100,000 people.\nSeventy-two years later, another powerful 7.3 magnitude quake hit the port city of Kobe in western Japan.\nHighways were toppled and thousands of buildings damaged. Some 6,400 people were killed and more than 400,000 injured; fires blazed across the city.\nIt is widely thought that Tokyo is expecting another powerful quake - and that this quake is now overdue.\nSo Japan puts considerable effort into preparing its response systems, its infrastructure and its citizens for potential disasters.\nThe government has invested heavily in monitoring systems. Founded in 1952, the Tsunami Warning Service is operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).\nIt monitors activity from six regional centres, assessing information sent by seismic stations both on and off-shore known collectively as the Earthquake and Tsunami Observation System.\nUsing this system, JMA aims to send out a tsunami warning within three minutes of an earthquake striking.\nWhen a quake hits, data concerning the magnitude and location are immediately flashed up on television by national broadcaster NHK.\nThe message then adds whether a tsunami warning has been issued and if so, for which areas.\nIn most towns and cities, loudspeaker systems can broadcast emergency information to residents.\nIn some rural areas, residents also have radios distributed by the local government over which instructions to evacuate can be broadcast.\nChildren practise ducking under the desk in earthquake drills throughout their school years. All adults are told where their closest evacuation centre - a park or sports field, for example - is located.\nInfrastructural checks are also in place. High-rise buildings in major cities are designed so that they sway rather than shake during earthquakes, making them safer.\nIn the wake of the Kobe earthquake, new regulations for quake-proofing buildings came into force, and some local governments offer citizens a structural health check on their homes.\nSome coastal areas have tsunami shelters, while others have built floodgates to withstand inflows of water from tsunamis.\nAnd if an earthquake above a certain magnitude strikes, the bullet train will stop and nuclear and other plants will automatically go into temporary shut down.\nAll in all, Japan is widely acknowledged to be one of the most earthquake-prepared nations.\nBut for all these safeguards, the risks posed are severe, as the latest massive earthquake has shown.", "summary": "Japan gave the word tsunami - meaning harbour wave - to the world; the destructive sea surges have been recorded throughout the country's history.", "id": "12709793", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan was a magnitude 9.0 undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan's Honshu island, and the largest earthquake", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe 2011 earthquake was the largest ever recorded in Japan.\nThe 2011 earthquake was the largest ever recorded in Japan.

starting with a 2.5% levy paid by employers on pay packages over \u00a3330,000.\nThe manifesto also says \u00a36.5bn will be raised from an aggressive programme to crack down on tax avoidance.\nPolitical parties always say they will do that, and it can be done - but it's a pretty inexact science.\nA further \u00a35.6bn comes from a new tax on financial transactions - known as a \"Robin Hood\" tax.\nAnother large chunk of extra revenue, \u00a36.4bn, comes from taxing high earners more.\nReality Check: Who would be affected by Labour's higher taxes?\nThose earning \u00a380,000 will be taxed at 45%, while a new 50% rate will be reintroduced for those on salaries above \u00a3123,000.\nThe new income tax rules will apply to about 4% of the workforce, that's about 1.2 million people.\nBut will all the changes bring in the sort of money Labour expects?\nThe headline numbers, for one, don't take into account any behavioural change.\nFor example, high earners could transfer part of their incomes into private pensions, do less work or leave the country.\nAnd remember, the Scottish Parliament has some freedom to set its own tax rates and thresholds.\nEven though the manifesto says the changes to income tax should raise \u00a36.4bn, Labour concedes that once behavioural change is taken into account, the actual money coming in will be lower.\nThe manifesto gives the party \u00a33.9bn of wiggle room for all their tax rises - an allowance for less money coming as a result of changing behaviour.\nBut according to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) - which looks at tax and spend policy - Labour might still be overestimating how much it thinks it can raise.\nThe IFS says Labour's forecasts \"looks a little on the optimistic side\".\nLikewise, companies may change their behaviour when tax rates change, and you also have to take account of the overall health of the economy.\nThis could affect the expected revenue from corporation tax changes and the introduction of the \"Robin Hood\" tax.\nOverall, though, Labour says it can finance all its current spending plans through changes in the tax system: \u00a348.6bn out, \u00a348.6bn in.\nBut these numbers do not include the party's big plans for investment spending and renationalising services such as the railways, the Royal Mail and so on.\nLabour says it will borrow money to pay for future investment - it pledges to create a National Transformation Fund of \u00a3250bn - but there is no detailed costing of nationalisation plans in the manifesto and what it will mean for overall borrowing.\nDespite all the extra borrowing, Labour makes one bold promise - it says it is committed to ensuring that the national debt is lower at the end of the next Parliament than it is today.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter", "summary": "Labour's manifesto itemises revenue-raising measures it says will bring in an extra \u00a348.6bn a year.", "id": "39939861", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"Labour's manifesto says it will borrow money to pay for future investment -

Sales of \"free from\" products grew 36% compared with a year earlier, he said.\nKantar monitors shoppers' habits using a sample of 30,000 households.\n\"The majority of products are bought by people who do not identify as having an intolerance,\" said Mr McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.\nHe said shoppers used the label as a short-cut to identify products they believed would be healthier.\nUrsula Philpott, a dietician at Leeds Beckett University, said that for the section of the population that did suffer from allergies and intolerances, the increased availability of these products was very helpful, but most of people did not need to avoid any specific food groups.\n\"A lot of people will be buying these because they've been sold the idea that gluten or dairy are in some way bad for you and that that's science-based, which for most people just isn't the case,\" she said.\n\"If we look at studies over the long term, we know the types of diets that lead to us having longer lives or having less disease states are things like Mediterranean diets, which don't include cutting out lots of things.\"\nKantar Worldpanel's survey also indicated that sales of \"free from\" products were higher amongst a more affluent demographic, reflected in higher sales of the products at Waitrose and Sainsbury's, compared with those grocers' market share.\nBut discounters Aldi and Lidl were also selling significant amounts of these products, said Mr McKevitt.\n\"Meanwhile, inflation shows no signs of abating.

for economy James Price told AMs that the panel had thought the firm had a \"reasonable chance\" of success.\nThe site at Waunarlwydd had been previously run by Alcoa Group, but was shut down in 2007.\nAnother firm, Falcon Steel, had received Welsh Government finance before entering liquidation in January 2011.\nMr Price told the assembly's public accounts committee on Monday that the Welsh Government's investment panel \"was convinced\" that Kancoat \"had a reasonable chance of being successful\".\n\"Simply because something has failed before doesn't always mean it's going to fail again,\" he said.\nBut, under further questioning from Swansea East AM Mike Hedges, Mr Price said: \"In this case the investment panel was proved wrong.\"\nAn earlier Wales Audit Office report had shown that a Welsh Government due-diligence review had raised concerns about Kancoat's business plan, saying it appeared \"weak and inconsistent\" and identifying it as high risk.\nBut Mr Price told the committee it was not unusual for a due-diligence officer \"to raise concerns and for us to still put money in\".\nMick McGuire, director of sectors and business at the Welsh Government, said the business plan for the firm had, on paper, \"looked credible and achievable\".\nBut he said the company's business plan had come across major issues in \"huge fluctuations in the availability and the cost\" of steel.\nMr McGuire said the business failed because the company's ability to manage \"unforeseen issues and fluctuations wasn't sufficient to keep it safe\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives have previously accused former economy minister Edwina Hart of breaking the ministerial code by approving support for a company close to her Gower constituency, although that was denied by First Minister Carwyn Jones.\nMr Price told the committee that he did not believe there was any \"undue influence\" from Mrs Hart on officials over Kancoat.\nHe did not believe she had \"any involvement beyond the consideration of the paperwork\" sent to her by officials.\nMr Price later said he could not \"categorically\" say she did not speak to staff about it, but would not have thought it to be \"improper\" if she had.\nHe added that no staff had raised \"anything\" with directors or him.\nMr Price said if an investment was to take place in a minister's constituency \"then there would be deemed a reasonable conflict or perception of conflict might exist, in which case advice would be sought\".\nOften that would end up being referred to the first minister, he explained.\nBut he explained that in this case, \"because the investment was outside of the minister's constituency area\", such a process was not adopted because \"there was deemed not to be a conflict of interest\".\nThe Welsh Government had previously said it had made a number of \"key changes\" to its procedures in the wake of the collapse of the firm.\nMr Price said there was \"now a vastly improved process\" in the way loans were awarded.\nMr McGuire added there \"has been interest\" from a company in buying the production line.", "summary": "The investment panel that recommended government cash support for a steel

It rested on the guiding principle that higher education should be open to all able and qualified enough to go.\nRobbins considered what the demand was likely to be over the next 20 years - based on the number of suitably qualified young people, not economic forecasts of future jobs.\nThe projections in Mr Willetts's pamphlet follow this model and suggests there will be a need for 92,000 more places for England-based students in UK universities in the next 20 years.\nHe says the current demographic backdrop is very different to the 1960s, when the country was in the grip of a baby boom, because of the fall in the number of babies born in the 1990s.\nBut he adds: \"However, looking ahead to the 2020s, we can see the increase in the number of births since the turn of the century feeding through into more young people. Those pressures have already been felt in our nurseries and primary schools.\"\nHe also argues that as educational standards in England improve over the coming years, there will be a greater supply of young people with the potential to go to university, thus increasing demand still further.\nAnd he goes on to highlight differences between the English higher education system and European ones, hinting at a more liberal approach.\nHe also says: \"The English system is quite unusual amongst advanced countries for having such selective systems of entry to university... Other countries allow virtually automatic progression to your local university if you have the requisite qualifications.\"\nAlthough the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has introduced more flexibility in the system, with universities being allowed to recruit unlimited numbers of brighter students (those gaining certain high grades), overall the numbers have remained fairly static since 2010.\nBut it is expected numbers will begin to recover again this coming year when admissions quotas for individual universities are being relaxed.\nWhen the Robbins report was published in 1963 there were nearly 216,000 full-time students in higher education. Robbins projected this number would grow to 558,000 by 1980-81.\nDirector of the Social Market Foundation Emran Mian said: \"David Willetts provides a compelling case for expanding higher education.

I don't quite know, I'd need to check.\n\"From a safety point of view you are not supposed to have mechanics out there just in case other cars are around.\n\"They are not systematically allowed to keep dummying to try and force the hand of others.\"\nSymonds was bemused by Mercedes' antics.\n\"You have to try and out-think them,\" he said. \"I think coming out in the pit lane is against the rules if it is not a genuine call. We didn't fall for that one.\"\nFormula 1's sporting regulations are a little vague on this subject, so it may be a stretch to say Mercedes broke a hard-and-fast rule.\nHere's the rule in question:\nIs it possible to hang a penalty on this, especially as it's so hard to prove intent? It certainly appears to be a grey area and one open to interpretation by the race stewards.\nIt would seem Mercedes gambled and got lucky.\nOf course it has.

Persistent high levels of glucose can lead to eye damage.\nThe research shows:\nHowever, 20% of those offered the screening - which began in 2003 and was rolled out across Wales by 2007 - do not take it up.\nDr Quentin Sandifer, medical director of Public Health Wales, said: \"We would encourage people living with diabetes to take up the offer when they receive their invitation.\n\"This is a great example of the NHS working together to improve outcomes for our population and is especially impressive as sight loss has reduced even through the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in Wales has increased over this time.\"\nWHAT IS DIABETES?\nPeople with type 1 diabetes cannot produce insulin. No-one knows exactly what causes it, but it is not to do with being overweight and it is not currently preventable. It usually affects children or young adults, starting suddenly and getting worse quickly. Type 1 diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses, a healthy diet and regular physical activity.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes do not produce enough insulin or the insulin they produce does not work properly (known as insulin resistance). They might get diabetes because of their family history, age and ethnic background. They are also more likely to get type 2 diabetes if they are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is treated with a healthy diet and increased physical activity.\nHow many have diabetes? Diabetes Wales estimates there are 183,000 people in Wales living with diabetes, while at least another 70,000 people could have it but are unaware or undiagnosed.\nDiabetic retinopathy or \"retinopathy\" when it is spotted it can be treated and deterioration prevented, whether controlled through medication or laser treatment.\nRobert Lee, 65, from Cardiff, has been having screenings since 2004 and runs a patient support group.\n\"I've seen people with serious eye problems and I've heard people say, if they'd known earlier it could have prevented these complications,\" he said.\n\"If by screening we can make sure we don't progress to that level, it's very important and it's a great service.\"\nProf David Owens, from the Diabetes Research Unit Cymru at Swansea University Medical School, said with the proportion of the population with diabetes expected to double in the next 25 years, the screening had already made a \"major difference\" and was the most dramatic seen anywhere in the UK.\n\"If you have long-term diabetes -  high blood sugar for a very long time - you will have damage to the small blood vessels at the back of the eye which supply all the blood and nutrition to the retina, which is essential,\" he said.\n\"The essence of the screening is diagnosing it early before it has a huge impact on vision and it can be treated relatively simply and successfully.\"\nPublic Health Minister Rebecca Evans said the research showed the significance of earlier diagnosis, alongside improved diabetes management, referral and newer

researchers have found, has has much less impact on their behaviour than being approached by a human.\nScientists say the unusual approach provides \"a less invasive and stressful way to collect data on these species\".\nThese findings are published in the journal Nature Methods.\nIn part of their study, the researchers even disguised one rover as a penguin chick in order to access a colony of notoriously nervous emperor penguins.\nDr Yvon Le Maho from the National Centre for Scientific Research in Strasbourg, France, led the study. He first decided to test the rover after he found that traditional flipper tags compromised the health of penguins.\nTo avoid these \"unethical\" flipper tags, the researchers began using tiny transponders - tags implanted under the birds' skin - to monitor a colony of king penguins on Possession Island in the South Indian Ocean.\nBut - just like the microchips often used to \"identichip\" pets - reading data from these tags requires them to be scanned up close using a receiver.\n\"I wondered if it might be possible to use a technological device to do this, and I thought about a rover,\" Dr Le Maho told BBC News.\nHe and his colleagues measured penguins' heart rates when the vehicle approached and when a human researcher approached.\n\"There was a very high increase in heart rate with the human -  much more than in a rover,\" he explained.\nThis reaction to people is exacerbated by the fact that, when the birds are incubating eggs, \"they won't move\".\nThe approach of the little vehicle certainly seemed to irritate the birds, which - as footage revealed -  waited until the rover came close, then lunged and snapped with their beaks and flippers.\n\"But when the rover stops, even within the territory of the birds, they don't pay any attention to it,\" said Dr Le Maho.\nIn fact when the team measured the increase in the birds' heart rate when the rover approached, the found it was about the same as when another bird passed by.\n\"It's very much higher when a person [approaches],\" said Dr Le Maho\n\"Even if the human is motionless, they still have a very high heart rate. And [it only returns to normal] more than five minutes after the human has left.\"\nIn the second part of their research, Dr Le Maho and his colleagues wanted to see if they could use their rover to study the very shy emperor penguin.\n\"Emperors huddle together, because they have no [other] territorial defence,\" the scientist explained. \"So when they see the rover approaching, they get very stressed.\n\"So we thought, what if you camouflage the rover - disguise it as a chick.\"\nThe researchers worked with the team of nature filmmakers, who produced the penguin documentary Spy in the Huddle.\nThis resulted in an even more a comical-looking rover, with a fake chick sitting on top, which the researchers used to infiltrate the colony.\nBut the disguise was effective; the emperor penguins allowed the rover to approach close enough to read their tags. Some birds even interacted with it - vocalising at the fake chick.\n\"Scientists do not generally speak about disturbance they cause,\" Dr Le Maho told BBC News.\n\"But I have always been very concerned with that - it relates to both science and ethics.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter", "summary": "It looks comical - a remote controlled car zipping around a penguin colony dodging irritated snaps from the birds.", "id": "29833843", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the rover had less impact on the penguins than a human.\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the rover had less impact on the penguins than a human.\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the rover had less impact on the penguins than a human.\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe researchers used a rover to study penguins, and found that the approach of the little vehicle seemed to irritate the birds, which -

At one point last year, desperate mothers formed a human chain around the main government building, begging for identity cards for their babies.\nThe economic situation is desperate. Four in ten are unemployed - in large part due to a series of botched privatisations.\nThat is what sparked the initial protests in Tuzla - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Bosnia.\nHundreds of people also gathered in support in the Bosnian Serb capital, Banja Luka.\nLocal media are reporting that the premiers of two of Bosnia's cantons - Sead Causevic of Tuzla canton and Munib Husejnagic of Zenica-Doboj canton - are to resign.\n'Exasperation'\nThe BBC's Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey says exasperation at years of inertia and incompetence in Bosnia is at the root of the protests.\nBosnia-Hercegovina is made up of two separate entities: a Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the Bosnian Serb Republic, or Republika Srpska, each with its own president, government, parliament, police and other bodies.\nThe complex administrative framework and deep divisions have led to political stagnation and vulnerability to corruption.\nThe current chairman of the Bosnian presidency, Zeljko Komsic, said that politicians were to blame for the protests.\nThe problem \"has been accumulating for several years, but the situation now escalated,\" he told FTV.\nHe was also quoted as saying he would be calling an urgent meeting of the top leadership.", "summary": "Demonstrators in Bosnia-Hercegovina have set fire to government buildings, in the worst unrest since the end of the 1992-95 war.", "id": "26086857", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe problem \"has been accumulating for several years, but the situation now escalated,\" he told FTV.

and Galloway Council gave its backing to the Pumped Storage Hydro (PSH) project earlier this year.\nPSH works by releasing water from a higher waterbody to a lower one and passing it through a turbine or series of turbines to generate electricity.\nWater is then pumped back up the hill and stored in the upper reservoir until further electricity is required.\nEconomy Secretary Keith Brown said: \"The Scottish government believes there is a huge opportunity around PSH.\n\"This tried and tested technology can support peak demand and effectively store greater levels of electricity at times when renewable energy output is high but demand is low.\"\nThe scheme - led by Buccleuch Estates and 2020 Renewables - has an operational capacity of up to 400MW.\nDevelopers have said the \u00c2\u00a3150m scheme could generate power for more than a century but will need \"major financial investment\" from other partners to proceed.\nThe construction phase is expected to last about six years and is part of wider renewable energy park plans on the site.\nScottish Renewables policy manager Hannah Smith said: \"The Glenmuckloch development is a perfect example of how green energy projects can make use of the infrastructure of the past and rejuvenate the local economy. PSH allows excess energy generated throughout the day to be stored and used when it's needed. It is vital that the UK government works to recognise the potential of this technology if we are to realise these benefits across the country.\"\nAlan Baker, managing director of 2020 Renewables, said:  \"Pumped storage brings considerable benefits to the country's energy system. Major pumped storage schemes already exist in Scotland - for example at Foyers and Cruachan - but no new projects have been built in over 30 years. The challenge is in finding the package of support measures which will unlock private investment in the project.\"\nJohn Glen, chief executive officer of Buccleuch, said: \"For five years we have been working closely with the local community and Hargreaves Surface Mining to restore and transform the site. Our vision is to create an energy park that will support local jobs and deliver major new investment in Dumfries and Galloway, and that has taken a step forward today.\"\nMP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale David Mundell said:  \"This is a very welcome announcement for the communities of Upper Nithsdale where I am always pushing for investment to help boost the local economy. Buccleuch and 2020's plans for a major development will help sustain jobs in the region and I am very excited to see how the project progresses.\"\nDumfries and Galloway Councillor Colin Smyth said:  \"As part of our commitment to build the local economy, our council has identified Upper Nithsdale as a key regeneration area where we want to encourage investment that will create jobs.  This development does just that by offering exciting job opportunities, which is so important for Upper Nithsdale.

so-called \"post-qualification application\" - rather than the current system of relying on predicted grades to receive conditional offers.\n\"If you started afresh you wouldn't have this elaborate system of predicted grades,\" he said.\nBut in the shorter term Mr Rammell says there are growing pressures from students which are already pushing the system towards post-qualifications applications.\nHe says that at his university he has already seen a growing number of students applying for the first time during clearing once they know their A-level results, rather than by the initial mid-January deadline.\nStudents are able to begin applications during clearing, which also provides a back-up system for those who missed out on their required grades.\nResearch from the admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are incorrect.\nAlthough a formal switch to a post-results system might not be imminent, he says the pressure of students who are applying late will \"effectively push it in that direction\".\nAs a higher-education minister under the Labour administration, Mr Rammell said he had been a \"strong advocate\" of the admissions system being moved.\nIf students knew their grades when applying it would be simpler, he says, and he believes the current system based on predictions is more likely to work against poorer students.\nMr Rammell says there had been \"conservative forces\" opposed to such a change, which could mean alterations to the timing of the exam system or the start of the autumn university term.\nHe says the major change in admissions in recent years has been that students, with their tuition fee, have a much stronger position in looking for places.\nIn the past, he says universities were choosing students, now it was much more a case of students choosing where they would like to study.\nBut he warns against the use of \"retail gimmicks\" to attract students and argues that recruitment should be based on offering a better student experience.\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, says universities are ready to handle record numbers of applications this week, with the limit on places removed this year.\n\"Despite the annual predictions that there will be a chaotic scramble for places, universities are, as always, prepared for the busy undergraduate admissions period,\" said Ms Dandridge.\nAnd she said it was important that the clearing process, used by 61,000 students last year, should not be seen as a \"second-best option\".\nUcas says that clearing provides a route for those who want to apply after they get exam results.\nAnd the admissions service suggests consultation on this had found \"significant practical challenges\" in implementing an admissions process after A-level results.", "summary": "The university admissions system should be switched so applications are made after students know their exam results, says a university vice-chancellor.", "id": "33861672", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has said that a move to a post-results system would be \"complex and costly\".\nIt says that the current system is \"robust and efficient\" and that it would be \"unf", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are incorrect.\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are incorrect.\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has said that a post-results system would be \"complex and costly\" to implement.\nIt says that the current system of predicted grades is \"more likely to work against poorer students\".", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are incorrect.\nThe admissions service, Ucas, has shown that about half of A-level grades predicted by teachers are", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe A-level results are out and the students are waiting for the results.\nThe students are waiting for the results and the universities are waiting for the students.\nThe students are waiting for the results and the universities are waiting for", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\n1.

How much value they will get for their money will not be clear for some time.\nIf things go well, Wolves could have a midfield full of continental flair, but it will be a challenge to get the best out of those players in the gruelling Championship once the days grow short.\nThe return of a more familiar face in Richard Stearman may turn out to be as valuable as any of the other signings.\nSome were slow to appreciate him in his first spell at Wolves, but by the time of his departure he was deservedly held in high regard by supporters.

They do however rub the teeth on the bottom, possibly to sharpen them.\nThe rostra of sawfish are prized as trophies, with specimens trading hands for thousands of dollars.\nThe fish were also heavily caught for the aquarium trade, until the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned most international trade in 2007.\nThe toothed rostrum also makes sawfish especially prone to entanglement in fishing nets; and with many living in estuaries, coastal development and loss of habitat is another factor that has wiped out populations across the tropics and sub-tropics.\nLike the sharks and rays to which they are related, their slow growth and reproduction also makes populations vulnerable.\n\"Sawfish are among the most endangered fish in the world,\" commented Sonja Fordham, president of the conservation group Shark Advocates International.\n\"Conservation actions - from education to strict national protection - are urgently needed in tropical and sub-tropical areas around the globe to prevent extinction and promote recovery of these remarkable animals.\"\nBarbara Wueringer is hopeful that her line of research could lead to practical ideas that would keep the animals alive.\n\"There is an upcoming field of research where people are trying to work with different electric field strengths or magnetic fields to deter animals like sharks and rays from fishing gear,\" she told BBC News.\n\"And to do that you have to know what field strength the animals are attracted to.\n\"Also, they had that reputation of being a sluggish bottom-dweller; we now that they actively move into the water column to take their prey from there, so that restricts the fishing methods that can be allowed in their areas.\"\nFollow Richardon Twitter", "summary": "The spectacular snouts of sawfish are revealed as complete hunting weapons, sensing prey and killing them.", "id": "17258808", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe saws, which can grow more than a metre long in some species, have previously been identified as able to sense prey by their electric fields.

It was while watching one of these events that Sheila became fascinated by the Queen.\n\"I saw Her Majesty sitting in the royal car,\" she says. \"I remember she was wearing a yellow outfit, a white hat and white gloves.\n\"Since then I have been lucky enough to have met her on many walkabouts.\n\"My mother was a huge royal enthusiast and her enthusiasm rubbed off on me. That's how it started.\n\"I suppose that my interest was also due to the fact that I'm close in age to Princes Andrew and Edward.\"\n\"I was always interested in history at school so I started collecting royal memorabilia when I was quite young. I had pictures and guidebooks and later when I was a bit older I started to add more items to the collection.\n\"As my collection has grown over the years, I can't begin to tell you how many items I have, although there are other followers with larger archives.\n\"It's the photos that mean the most to me. I have over 400 now.\n\"My two favourites include one of the changing of the guard which I got when I was about seven years old. And the other is one taken of my late mother with Prince Charles in 2003.\"\nAnother key moment for Sheila was the 1981 marriage of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer.\n\"Everything became bigger once Prince Charles married Diana,\" she says.\n\"The number of royal events I attended increased during that decade. I also met my friend Mary Relph at this time. Mary is from King's Lynn and another royal watcher like me.\"\nSheila and Mary have since been to many royal events together and received seats in the Diamond Jubilee ballot to watch events outside Buckingham Palace.\n\"It was my most poignant memory over the years as the Duke of Edinburgh had to miss some of the ceremony due to ill health.\n\"I remember thinking that the Queen looked very lonely without him at her side.\"\nSheila still goes to events whenever she can, although nowadays these tend to be mostly in Scotland with occasional trips to London or Sandringham.\n\"I've met the Queen many times over the years. She's got to know me pretty well.\n\"The most memorable and special meetings were when she stopped her Range Rover to speak to me once in a village near Sandringham in 2005 and in the grounds of Balmoral in July 2006.\n\"Sandringham is the one that I most recall as I was there with another royal watcher friend.\n\"Her Majesty was driving a Range Rover at the time. She recognised us both and asked whether we were going to be at the Sunday service the next day.\"\n\"When we heard that my mother was ill and dying of cancer, we told Her Majesty. She made a point of making an extra special effort to come over to speak to us everywhere we went.\n\"Just a few hours after my mum gave the Queen some flowers after the Maundy service in Liverpool in 2004, my mum was taken ill and sadly died a couple of weeks later.\n\"I think Her Majesty is a very special person who has devoted her entire life to serving this country and deserves the respect in which she is held all round the world.\"\nFind out more about Queen Elizabeth II on BBC iWonder", "summary": "For the past 50 years Royal Family watcher and fan Sheila Clark has been travelling around the UK to events attended by the Queen, meeting and taking photos of the monarch.", "id": "36049718", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe is the world's longest-serving current head of state.\nShe is", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe is the world's longest-serving current head of state.\nShe is", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe is the world's longest-serving current head of state.\nShe is", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Queen is the longest serving monarch in British history.\nShe has been on the throne for 63 years.\nShe has been Queen since 1952.\nShe is the first monarch to celebrate a Diamond J", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe is the world's longest-serving current head of state.\nShe is", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe has been on the throne for 23,226 days.\nShe", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe is the world's longest-serving current head of state.\nShe is", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe Queen is the longest-serving monarch in British history.\nShe has reigned for 63 years and 216 days.\nShe is the world's longest-serving current head of state.\nShe is", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe Queen is the longest serving monarch in British history.\nShe has been on the throne for 65 years.\nShe has been on the throne for 65 years.

Taggart's ratings within the STV region remained strong.\nBut when the series was shown on the network a few months later, it was a different story. Taggart's ratings across the UK fell to 3.8 million for the most recent series - considered poor for a mainstream drama.\nIn recent years, ITV has axed a number of long-running dramas - notably Heartbeat and The Bill - to put more effort into bringing new shows to the screen.\nAlthough Taggart had lost its popularity on ITV1, it remains popular in Scotland and is important to STV commercially and the television industry in Scotland.\nFor instance, STV generates money from Taggart through sales to foreign broadcasters - over the years it has been screened in many countries around the world.\nDistributor DRG said Taggart was a \"hugely popular\" series internationally, airing across three different TV channels in Australia alone.\nA DRG spokesperson added: \"It's our shared ambition to return Taggart to UK screens and we can confirm we're currently working closely with STV as we explore options to achieve this.\"\nITV did recently commission another drama from STV - a 90-minute one-off called Fast Freddie, The Widow and Me, which is expected to be shown over Christmas.\nSTV and ITV recently ended a long-running legal dispute amicably.

the National Union of Teachers, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the National Association of Head Teachers, Unison, Unite and the GMB, said this would mean an average annual loss of \u00a3339 for every primary pupil and \u00a3477 for every secondary pupil.\nThe new analysis compares the predicted funding changes for schools generally with those for 997 schools with more than 40% of pupils on free school meals.\nThe figures suggest that funding for these schools would fall:\nChild Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham called the figures \"shocking\".\n\"If the country -

Others include separating the scheme from the employer or transferring savers and pensioners to a new scheme altogether.\nThe plan has been supported by some union leaders and the British Steel Pension scheme.\nHowever, it has been criticised by the former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who said that \"rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry\".\nMr Webb's argument has, in part, been echoed by the PPF.\nIn its response to the consultation, the PPF said: \"There is a risk of setting a precedent. Although the government has been at pains to stress the unique circumstances surrounding the British Steel Pension Scheme, we would nevertheless expect other employers or industries to seek similar arrangements to reduce their pension scheme liabilities - effectively transferring value from scheme members to shareholders.\"\nIt said that, for thousands of pensioners themselves, there would be little difference between the amount of pension they would receive under the revised terms that have been proposed and the amount they would receive if the PPF took on the liabilities.\nIt also raised concerns about one idea of allowing the pension scheme to continue, but with only a \"shell\" company behind it. In other words, there would be no backstop to deal with any growing deficit in the scheme.\n\"With no genuine employer to act as a buffer and provide additional contributions when needed, the risk of the scheme's investment strategy failing would either fall on the scheme members or - if it was decided to maintain PPF eligibility - be directly underwritten by the PPF,\" it said.\nIt suggested that even if there were a \"low risk investment strategy\" there was a possibility that the burden would eventually fall on the PPF. This could hit the PPF's own level of funding which is in place to protect pensioners with defined benefit workplace pensions if any employer goes under.\nOne solution according to the PPF, if this government plan went ahead, would be to remove the safety net that the PPF provides. Under these circumstances, the British Steel Pension Scheme would no longer pay the regular levy to the PPF, and the PPF would not cover the cost of compensation payments to pensioners if, at some point in the future, the pension scheme's trustees decided its assets could not cover pension payments.\nTata is still considering bids for its UK steel business, with a shortlist expected soon.", "summary": "The lifeboat scheme that protects pensions when a company fails has raised concerns over a government plan for steel workers' pensions.", "id": "36586346", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

It is that discrepancy which makes it relatively rare for the three bodies to line up in space.\nFrom western Europe, north-western Africa and much of the Americas, Mercury's seven-and-a-half-hour glide across the Sun will be visible in its entirety. A further swathe of the planet (see map below) will catch part of the transit, depending on local sunrise and sunset times.\nThe only land masses to miss out completely are Australasia, far eastern Asia and Antarctica.\nBecause Mercury is so small - just one-third as big as Earth and, from our perspective, 1/150th of the Sun's diameter - its transit can only be glimpsed under serious magnification; the \"eclipse glasses\" used by thousands of people to view last year's solar eclipse will be useless.\nAnd to avoid permanent eye damage, any telescope must be fitted with a solar filter before being trained on the Sun. The British Astronomical Association explains on its website how amateur stargazers can enjoy the spectacle safely.\nOpen University's Prof David Rothery said the celestial event would not present any novel scientific opportunities - but was special nonetheless.\n\"From this transit, we're unlikely to learn anything we don't already know,\" he told BBC Inside Science. \"But what a wonderful event for showing people Mercury. It's a hard planet to see.\n\"Historically, transits were of immense importance.\"\nIn the 1700s, for example, it was observations of Mercury and Venus slipping across the Sun that allowed astronomers, led by Edmund Halley, to pin down the dimensions of the known Solar System.\nProf Rothery is a Mercury expert and a leading scientist on the European Space Agency's BepiColombo mission to the diminutive planet, which will launch in 2017 or 2018.\nMercury has already been visited by two Nasa probes: Mariner 10 flew past in 1974 and 1975 and Messenger spent four years in orbit until its planned crash landing in 2015.\n\"[Messenger] told us an awful lot. It really told us we don't understand Mercury - because there's a lot of things which just don't stack up,\" Prof Rothery said.\n\"It's an airless body, with lots of craters... But there's been a long history of volcanic activity, fault activity - and the composition, that began to be revealed by Messenger, is weird.\n\"There's very little iron at the surface but it must have a ginormous iron core, because it generates a magnetic field - which Venus, Mars and the Moon don't.\"", "summary": "Skywatchers across the globe are observing Mercury transit the Sun, the little planet's third such pass of 14 it will make this century.", "id": "36228327", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nMercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System.

the meat but Jagger showed no signs of illness until he was back in Belgium, the club said.\nIt said it was \"inconceivable\" the dog was poisoned at Crufts.\nJagger, who came second in his class at Birmingham's NEC on Thursday, is owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott and her husband, Jeremy Bott.\nHis Leicester-based co-owners declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.\nThey have previously said he must have been poisoned \"while on his bench\" at the show at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC).\nThree-year-old Jagger, whose pedigree name is Thendara Satisfaction, died on 7 March after returning to Belgium with fellow owner Aleksandra Lauwers.\nA spokesman for the Kennel Club said: \"There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible.\nThe spokesman added it was \"highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death\".\nSevere symptoms from the two poisons - carbofuran and aldicarb, which are banned in the EU - would usually occur within 30 minutes to three hours, the club said.\nThe spokesman said that because Jagger showed the first clinical signs associated with the poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, \"we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday 5 March, some 28 to 36 hours earlier\".\n\"Furthermore, the poison is thought to have been given on a piece of beef that was still largely undigested when the autopsy was performed on Saturday 7 March morning, and food is usually absorbed in dogs within six hours,\" he added.\nSpeaking at the time of Jagger's death, co-owner Jeremy Bott said he did not think the dog was specifically targeted, but the culprit may have been acting on \"a grudge against dogs or the Crufts show\".\nDays after the dog's death, The Telegraph published claims from other exhibitors stating their dogs were sick after the event but Crufts said it could not look into the claims as it had \"no direct information\".\nThere were also claims another dog - a shih tzu - was fatally poisoned, but the club said it had not received any information about it and confirmed no shih tzus were seen by vets at the show.\nThe club said on Monday: \"We have a lot of security measures in place to protect the dogs at our show and we continually review our procedures because the welfare and safety of the dogs is

Many thought then that the younger Mr Kim would eventually succeed his father.\nThis weekend foreign journalists had a chance to confirm that suspicion when they were unexpectedly allowed to visit North Korea.\nJust hours after landing in Pyongyang's shabby airport - there is little air traffic - we were whisked to a special performance of the Arirang Games.\nAnnual performances take place over a series of weeks involving tens of thousands of singers, acrobats and gymnasts in an open-air stadium.\nKoreans 'don't want' young Kim\nProfile: Kim Jong-un\nFor Saturday night's show the venue was ringed with soldiers carrying machine guns.

The audience turned their heads to look and then cheered.\nThe two men appeared together again on Sunday at the military parade, which took place in Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square - named after the current leader's father, the founder of North Korea.\nThe parade was organised to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.\nNorth Korea used the event to show off some of its military hardware. There were rocket launchers, missiles and tanks spewing smoke.\nThere were also thousands of goose-stepping soldiers, marching in perfect unison.

The staff need not have had any worries about us athletes staying out late, I think we were all asleep well before midnight. Apparently the fireworks were good!\nLast week the World Cup was in Altenberg, the track I won gold on last year, and because of that I had very high expectations of myself going into the week.\nAltenberg has a reputation as the most technical course on the tour, and there is one particular corner called the 'Kreisel' which athletes find quite scary.\nIt's a full 360-degree corner with four big pressures and the potential to hit the roof in any that you don't steer just right. I'm no stranger to the roof myself, having crashed there more than once in my earlier years!\nThe other reason it's so challenging is it's not just a matter of navigating it safely, but the idea is also to generate speed as you go.\nBecause the Kreisel falls in the middle of the course, it's really important to carry as much speed from the top as you can through to the last few corners below it, so you have to try and do just enough to be safe without overdoing it and slowing yourself down too much.\nAs it happens, Kreisel went quite well for me but I made a mistake in an earlier corner on my first run that cost me some time. In the end I finished sixth which, considering the mistake, I was happy with.\nI also managed to produce the two fastest pushes which gives me confidence that I'm in good shape as we get closer to the World Championships.\nRecently the World Championships were moved from their original venue in Sochi, Russia, to Konigssee, Germany, following the publication of the second part of the McLaren report.\nHistorically, I haven't had my best results in Konigssee, but I trained well there last year and I feel I'm due some luck there. There's definitely an element of luck in our sport, with it being outdoors in winter, there's obviously the weather that can play a huge part.\nIn all three races of the season so far we have had snow during the runs, and in Lake Placid I unfortunately got the worst of it, but you just have to hope that at some point the luck will even out.\nThe snow has followed us here to Winterberg too where we have the next race on Sunday, which also doubles as the European Championships.\nWe arrived on Sunday and for the first training day I just watched other people slide, rather than sliding myself.\nSometimes I find that watching sleds come past and seeing the shapes the sleds make in the corners as they come past actually helps show me what is happening on the track and how the ice is behaving as much as if I was sliding.\nWith it being another race in Germany, the home team will be at a big advantage but I'm feeling good about the track and excited to race here.\nThis track has a very different personality to Altenberg. It is much more subtle, and starts slowly, but then the speed sneaks up on you in the last few corners and you can be doing around 130kph before you know it!", "summary": "I'm back on tour again after a short Christmas break, heading into World Cup number four in Winterberg, Germany.", "id": "38602917", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe World Cup is a series of races that take place in different countries around the world.\nThe World Cup is a series of races that take place in different countries around the world.

The process has enabled Lord Carter to benchmark what each hospital should be doing in each department.\nThe biggest savings were identified in general medicine, followed by obstetrics and gynaecology.\nThe Labour peer also said hospitals should build their own care homes to look after elderly patients after they have been treated to make it easier to discharge patients.\nBy Hugh Pym, BBC health editor\nLord Patrick Carter, a Labour peer as it happens, is advising Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt on how hospital budgets can be better spent.\nIn a nutshell, Lord Carter believes that just as there is variation in levels of care around the NHS, as identified by the Care Quality Commission, there are also variations in the use of money by hospitals - some are doing it well and providing good value for the taxpayer, some are not.\nHe is a firm believer in good leadership leading to high-quality patient care and the most efficient use of resources.\nIf hospitals all adopted the best practice for different surgical procedures and treatments, he argues, then outcomes for patients would be better and money would be saved.\nRead more from Hugh\nProf Tim Briggs, a leading orthopaedic surgeon, has led efforts to standardise his own surgical speciality and will now help hospitals identify the most effective products and techniques across other surgical fields.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that improving quality of care and reducing post-operative complications could bring savings of about a billion pounds a year.\n\"If you look at the other side too - which is procurement - we've got to get our costs down\", he added.\n\"Everybody says, 'We've got the best deal,' when they clearly haven't.\"\nIt comes at a time of mounting pressure on NHS finances. In the first three months of this financial year, a deficit of nearly \u00a31bn has already built up - more than the overspend for the whole of last year.\nLord Carter said: \"The route to better care is to empower NHS leaders, so giving them the data and support they need means they can improve how they care for patients and make savings which can be reinvested in front-line care.\n\"Patients will be the real winners.\"\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt added: \"We are giving the service \u00a310bn extra this Parliament so it is vital to use that money to secure the best outcomes.\"\nBut Jennifer Dixon, head of the Health Foundation think tank, said: \"The complexity of the task at hand cannot be underestimated.

were dropped weeks before the 2009 election which led to him becoming president.\nBut last month, a high court judge described that decision as \"irrational\".\nMr Zuma has always denied the allegations which are linked to a 1999 arms deal worth billions of dollars.\nAnd in April, a judge-led commission of inquiry found no evidence of corruption or fraud by any government officials at the time the deal was made.\nLive: Zuma decision announced\nProfile: Jacob Zuma\nAfter a case brought by the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), Judge Aubrey Ledwaba said last month that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) should consider re-opening the case.\nBut National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams said that prosecutors should be able to exercise discretion over whether an investigation should continue.\nBriefing journalists, Mr Abrahams said that this was an issue that affected the separation of powers and that the ruling \"has far-reaching ramifications\".\nHe said he would be seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court ruling .\nQuoting legislation that defines the role of the NPA, Mr Abrahams said that he did his job \"without fear, favour or prejudice\", adding that no-one influenced his decisions.\nThe DA described the prosecutor's decision as a \"blatant delaying tactic to shield [Mr] Zuma from his day in court\".\nThis decision means that President Jacob Zuma is off the hook, for now.\nBy appealing against last month's High Court ruling, the NPA has refused to reinstate the charges.\nAlthough chief prosecutor Shaun Abrahams was at pains to explain his independence, the opposition still maintains that he is too close to President Zuma.\nIf the Supreme Court of Appeal rules against the NPA, Mr Abrahams would have to go to the highest court in the land, the Constitutional Court.\nSo the allegations of corruption against the 73-year-old president are still going to be in our daily diet for some time to come.\nBut the president must be breathing a bit easier now.\nThe DA asked the courts to review the 2009 decision after it got access to the evidence in the so-called \"spy tapes\" that led the chief prosecutor Mokotedi Mpshe to drop the case.\nIn 2009, Mr Mpshe said that the tapes - recordings of phone conversations between officials discussing the timing of the case against Mr Zuma - suggested that there was political interference in the investigation.\nLast month, Judge Ledwaba said Mr Mpshe had \"found himself under pressure\" when he decided to discontinue the prosecution and \"consequently made an irrational decision\".\n\"Considering the situation in which he found himself, Mr Mpshe ignored the importance of the oath of office which commanded him to act independently and without fear and favour.\n\"Mr Zuma should face the charges as outlined in the indictment,\" the judge said.\nThe investigation into Mr Zuma's alleged corruption had become heavily politicised, amid a power struggle between Mr Zuma and then-President Thabo Mbeki.\nMr Zuma was sacked as deputy president in 2005 shortly after his financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was found guilty of corruption and fraud in relation to the arms deal.\nControversial arms deal: What you need to know", "summary": "South Africa's prosecution says it will appeal against a court ruling that it should reconsider

despite their best efforts.\nThat way lies the chaos of a resentful backlash. And capitalism does not like chaos.\nLast week, Andrew Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, warned of a country where economic divisions are growing.\nOn Monday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank, said that Britain was facing \"a lost decade\" of stagnant incomes where people in work were no better off than before the financial crisis.\nToday's Joseph Rowntree report reveals that what is called \"in-work poverty\" is at record levels.\nMillions of people are endeavouring to do an honest day's (or night's) work for not very much pay at all.\nThis is the issue of our age - the sense that despite effort expended, people feel \"the system\" is against them.\nAs Mr Carney said, there is much greater acceptance of high and stubborn levels of inequality - which hasn't actually changed significantly in relative terms since the financial crisis - as long as people feel their position is getting better or has the potential to do so.\nOnce that breaks down, because of stagnant incomes and high costs of living, faith in the system falls and the desire for radical change grows.\nTheresa May is acutely aware of this. She has spoken of an economy that \"works for all\".\nIt is an ambitious target, and presumably means that fewer people should suffer in-work poverty, not more.\nThe prime minister has three years to achieve a reversal of the trend highlighted by today's report.\nThen, she faces a public who have yet to vote for her as a prime minister in a general election.\nWith in-work benefits frozen and the risk of inflation rising, Downing Street knows it is facing into some significant headwinds.\nThere is much good news in the Joseph Rowntree report.\nThe pensioner poverty rate is down. The number of people in workless families is down as employment levels rise. Attainment levels at school are improving.\nBut Mrs May has not set her government that test. She has set a test on how the economy operates and who is rewarded.\nThe PM has bet the farm on improving productivity, the amount of economic value produced for each hour worked.\nThe wealth created should mean a pay rise for all.\nThat means investing in roads and railways, and businesses backing new technology and skills training so that Britain works more smoothly.\nThese are long term projects aimed at solving deep seated problems. And the levers are not all under the control of the state.\nThe private sector will have to play its role.\nMass low wage sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality will find themselves under increasing scrutiny.\nThose on lower incomes feel squeezed - are squeezed - now.\nThe next election is in 2020.\nMrs May will hope that the Joseph Rowntree report on poverty that comes out the Christmas before that date has better news.\nThat an honest day's work is actually rewarded with an honest day's pay.", "summary": "\"My politics are based not on some economics theory,\" Margaret Thatcher once said, \"but on things I and millions like me were brought up with.", "id": "38228822", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

The small island state relies on trade for its economy to grow. It's also home to one of the biggest ports in the region. It was hoping to benefit from an increase in services such as shipping and trade financing that it was expecting to follow from more regional and global trade.\nVietnam: According to this study by the Petersen Institute, Vietnam was expected to benefit the most from the TPP because it is still a relatively closed economy. This trade deal would have given it tariff free access for its rice, seafood, textiles and low-end manufactured goods. Some estimates say Vietnam could have seen a 10% boost to its economy by 2025 under the TPP.\nMalaysia: According to that same Petersen study, Malaysia could see its economy grow by 5.5% in the same period because of the pact, which was set to give it access to the US for its palm oil exports, but at the same time under the rules of the agreement it had to agree to higher international labour standards.\nThe central premise of the US-backed TPP was: join our party, we'll all get rich together, and we'll all abide by international standards. Everybody wins.\nExcept now that's no longer true - instead, the biggest winner is now the country who was never included in the TPP to begin with...\nChina: As my colleague Carrie Gracie explains, China is well placed to step into the US's global footprint with both its regional trade deal alternative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership deal, and it's massive and expensive One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, which aims to build roads, ports and highways through much of Asia.\nOther countries that have not joined the TPP  (including Thailand, the Philippines and others who are close to China like Laos and Cambodia for instance, could also stand to gain from RCEP and OBOR.)\nThis is typically the role the US has played in the past few decades in Asia, through US financial bodies and global institutions.\nSome analysts say China has been playing the \"New Great Game\" in Asia (a reference to the power rivalry we saw in the 19th century in Central Asia), grabbing any opportunity it can find to increase its influence in the region.\nMr Trump may have just handed Beijing the chance it has been looking for.", "summary": "No one should be surprised that Donald Trump plans to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact before it has even begun.", "id": "38061616", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe US has been the dominant player in Asia for the past 70 years.\nThe US has been the dominant player in Asia for the past 70 years.

She has raised tens of millions of dollars for her campaign, she has institutional support across the Democratic Party and she's been positioning herself for this race since 2008, when was edged out by Barack Obama.\nDuring his Rose Garden speech, Mr Biden defended Mr Obama's presidential legacy and took another veiled shot at Mrs Clinton's remark last week that she considered Republicans to be her enemies.\nHe said he will continue to speak out over the course of the campaign, but today - given the rapt attention he commanded as a potential candidate - was his valedictory address.\nIn explaining his decision not to join the race, after three months pondering it, he said his family had \"reached a point\" where they felt they could cope with his third presidential run, but time was now against him.\nHis son Beau died from brain cancer in May, another family tragedy for the former Delaware senator after the deaths of his baby daughter and first wife in 1972.\nHe then rose through the Senate ranks and ran for president in 1988 and 2008.\nAfter hearing the news, presidential candidates for 2016 tweeted their well wishes.\nMr Sanders also tweeted that he supported Mr Biden's plans to make college free, fight economic inequality and close tax loopholes.\nDemocratic candidate Martin O' Malley tweeted that he respected Mr Biden's decision and that he is \"one of the most decent, compassionate public servants our nation has produced\".", "summary": "US Vice-President Joe Biden has announced he will not run for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 White House race.", "id": "34594675", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34605991?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34605991?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34601991?ocid=socialflow_twitter\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-us", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34605891?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34605891?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nMr Biden said he would not be a candidate for the White House in 2016.\nHe said he would not be a candidate for the White House in 2016.\nHe said he would not be a", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nMr Biden said he would not be able to devote the time and energy to a campaign that he would have liked.\n\"I'm not a candidate,\" he said. \"I'm not taking donations.

the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\nIf re-elected, the SNP wants to double the current 16 hours-a-week provision.\nAbout 86% of private nurseries in Scotland currently deliver free places for three and four-year-olds.\nMany toddlers, including all three and four-year-olds are entitled to 600 hours a year of free nursery provision.\nThe National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has claimed that private nurseries typically get about \u00c2\u00a340,000 a year less than the true cost from councils.\nThey can recoup this through the fees charged for younger children or from additional hours.\nThe association said many nurseries do not feel confident about offering more free hours in the future.\nLaunching its annual nursery survey, NDNA chief executive Purnima Tanuku said: \"This enormous shortfall is a huge burden on private and third sector nurseries.\n\"They have no choice but to try to absorb these costs themselves or pass them onto parents by increasing fees for additional hours or for younger children.\n\"Their main concern is that if free early learning and childcare is expanded, far fewer parents will need any additional hours, so they will struggle to make up this shortfall, especially with the National Living Wage being introduced next month.\"\nShe added: \"The vast majority of nurseries are small businesses and can't afford these losses. They want to offer parents these free hours, but at the same time they have to be sustainable. Almost half of the nurseries who responded expected only to break even, with 11% expecting a loss.\n\"Nursery owners are keen to support families and make free childcare a success for everyone, but need to know their costs will be covered.\"\nAccording to the survey, only half of respondent nurseries would be likely to extend their funded hours and 22% were unlikely, or very unlikely, to increase the amount of funded places they offered.\nCouncil organisation Cosla said it was not the role of councils to offer public money to achieve a profit for private nurseries.\nEducation spokeswoman Councillor Stephanie Primrose said: \"Councils have a responsibility to ensure the quality of the provision, but also to ensure that good value is achieved from the public pound.\n\"It is also a pity that no account is taken in the campaign of those costs that NDNA members don't have to bear, because of the free or subsidised support provided by councils in terms of training and awareness-raising for private provider staff.\n\"NDNA members enter into partnerships with councils of their own volition, so there should be absolutely no expectation that council commissioning or procurement processes to contract for the provision of early learning and childcare services will focus on the needs of their businesses, rather than the needs of the child.\"\nChildren's Minister Aileen Campbell said: \"We have provided an additional \u00c2\u00a3500m since 2014 to fully fund the extra costs of expanding free early learning and childcare to almost 16 hours a week - 45% more than in 2007 - and extending this entitlement to around 27% of two-year-olds.\n\"We will continue to increase funding year-on-year to support increasing flexibility and choice and we would fully expect local authorities to fund partner providers appropriately to support the delivery of high-quality provision.\"", "summary": "Private nurseries in Scotland are not receiving enough cash to meet the cost of free places for three and four-year-olds, it has been claimed.", "id": "35816785", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\"\nThe National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has claimed that private nurseries typically get about", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"The National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\"\nThe National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\"The National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\"\nThe National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has claimed that private nurseries typically get about", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\"\nThe National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\"The National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\"\nThe National Day Nurseries Association said many of the nurseries may not help to provide the additional", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\"We have provided an additional \u00c2\u00a3500m since 2014 to fully fund the extra costs of expanding free early learning and childcare to almost 16 hours a week - 45% more than in", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\"The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has warned that many private nurseries may not be able to provide the additional nursery care the Scottish government is planning.\n\"If re-elected, the SNP wants to", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\"We have provided an additional \u00c2\u00a3500m since 2014 to fully fund the extra costs of expanding free early learning and childcare to almost 16 hours a week - 45% more than in", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "1.

She said she would be monitoring progress from now on.\nLord Ouseley, formerly chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, warned that the House's top positions form \"a 'no entry' area for BME employees\".\nThe figures have been released by the House of Lords in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request about the ethnic profile of the House's own workforce, numbering nearly 600, from clerks to catering.\nIt does not include researchers and other staff directly employed by peers themselves, or bicameral staff shared with the Commons.\nThe seven top pay bands range from \u00a349,083 to \u00a3176,226 including the senior clerks and managers of administrative workers. The maximum salary in a pay range containing a declared black or ethnic minority employee is \u00a342,686.\nThe FOI request revealed black and minority ethnic workers are overwhelmingly concentrated in the House's lower pay bands, with over half the BME workforce employed in housekeeping, catering and retail.\nFive out of six workers at the lowest pay level are BME, earning between \u00a317,135 and \u00a317,744 a year.

It has just 6% BME representation in the top seven pay levels, with 40% at the catering level.\nThe Commons launched a diversity scheme in 2012, aiming to improve minority representation at senior levels.

named as successor, but has asked for a delay in the process.\nThe death of the world's longest-reigning monarch sparked an outpouring of grief in Thailand.\nOfficial mourning will last a year. The cabinet declared Friday a government holiday, and flags are to fly at half-mast for the next 30 days.\nPeople have been asked to wear black, and avoid \"joyful events\" during this period. Cinema screenings, concerts and sports events have been cancelled or postponed.\nNews websites have turned their pages black and white, and all television channels in Thailand are airing programmes about the king's life.\nThe crown prince travelled in the convoy carrying the king's body, which will lie at a temple in the royal palace while people pay their respects.\nIt could be months before the late king's cremation.\n\"This is the worst loss in my life,\" said one of those lining the streets.\nLater on Friday, the Crown Prince conducted the bathing ceremony of the king's body, a traditional Thai Buddhist funeral rite.\nThe king had been ill for a long time. When news of his death was announced on Thursday evening, many in the large crowds outside the hospital where he died broke down.\nKing Bhumibol was widely respected across Thailand, and thought of by many as semi-divine.\nHe earned the devotion of Thais for his efforts to help the rural poor, such as agricultural development projects, and works of charity.\nThe monarch was also seen as a stabilising figure in a country often wracked by political turmoil.\nThailand remains under military rule following a coup in 2014.\nThe country has suffered from political violence and upheaval over the past decade, as well as a long-running Muslim separatist insurgency in the southern provinces which sees regular small-scale bomb attacks.\nThough a constitutional monarch with limited official powers, many Thais looked to King Bhumibol to intervene in times of high tension. He was seen as a unifying and calming influence through numerous coups and 20 constitutions.\nHowever, his critics argued he had endorsed military takeovers and at times had failed to speak out against human rights abuses.\nThe crown prince, who is 64, is much less well known to Thais and has not attained his father's widespread popularity. He spends much of his time overseas, especially in Germany.\nWhile the Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said the crown prince will ascend the throne next, there is uncertainty over when that will happen after the prince asked for a delay in succession.\nProfile: Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn\nPrivy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda, a 96-year-old former prime minister, has been named regent in line with the constitution.\nHe remains as regent until the Thai assembly invites the heir to succeed to the throne, the Bangkok Post reported.\nStrict lese-majeste laws protect the most senior members of Thailand's royal family from insult or threat. Public discussion of the succession can be punishable by lengthy jail terms.\nGiven the pivotal role the king has played in maintaining the balance of power in Thailand's volatile political environment, the succession will be a formidable challenge for the government, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok.", "summary": "Thousands of Thai people have packed the streets of Bangkok to see

has also defaulted on foreign loans and clashed with Washington on several issues.\nMr Correa is regarded as the strongest leader in decades to be at Ecuador's helm, and his approval ratings have remained consistently above 50%.\nMuch of his popularity can be attributed to the government's public spending, including on roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.\nCash transfers have boosted the incomes of the poorest Ecuadoreans, and poverty levels have dropped from some 38% in 2006 to 29%  today, according to the World Bank.\nMr Correa, a US-trained economist, announced in December 2008 that Ecuador was officially defaulting on billions of dollars of foreign debt that it considered \"illegitimate\".\nEcuador, an Opec member, is heavily dependent on oil exports. Mr Correa has pushed for new contracts with foreign oil companies operating in the country, increasing the share of income that goes to the state.  Critics warned that such moves could deter foreign investors.\nOther high-profile decisions Mr Correa has taken include his refusal to renew the lease on airbases used by US forces to mount anti-narcotics missions.\nIn February 2009, Ecuador expelled two US diplomats, accusing them of meddling in the country's internal affairs - charges Washington rejected.\nMr Correa came to office promising constitutional reform and in September 2008 some 65% of Ecuadoreans voted in a referendum to approve a new constitution that brought sweeping changes.\nMr Correa's opponents accused him of seeking to override Ecuador's democratic institutions and amass too much power for himself.\nPresident Correa has described the private media as his \"greatest enemy\" and a major obstacle to implementing reforms.\nHe often uses his weekly radio and TV shows as a platform to attack them. He also uses a law that requires the media to carry government messages as a way of directly confronting his critics.\nIn 2011, three executives and a former columnist from an opposition newspaper, El Universo were sentenced to jail terms and a massive fine for libelling President Correa. He subsequently pardoned them, saying his aim had been to fight the \"dictatorship of the media\".\nIn 2012, Reporters Without Borders highlighted the closure of some dozen broadcasting outlets that were critical of the government.\nPresident Correa came to wider international notice after offering asylum to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who remains at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.\nMr Correa was born in 1963 in the city of Guayaquil.\nHe studied economics in that city's Catholic University and then went on to get two masters degrees - one in the US and the other in Belgium - and, in 2001, a PhD.\nThe father of three speaks fluent English and French and can also speak the indigenous Quechua language, which he learnt while doing voluntary work.\nMr Correa describes himself as \"left-wing - not from the Marxist left, but rather a Christian left\".", "summary": "Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa won an unprecedented third term in elections in February 2013.", "id": "11449110", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"He had already been in office for six years - no mean feat in a country that went through seven presidents in the 10 years before Mr Correa was elected.

reduce them.\n\"That is the key point - ignoring a risk is not to reduce it,\" he said.\nHowever, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, a Leave campaigner, repeated criticism that Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the Leave risks.\nMr Duncan Smith told Andrew Neil's Sunday Politics programme: \"If you're going to be impartial, if you're going to be

made gains in Iraq despite US-led coalition air strikes.\nIn May the militants seized Ramadi, the capital of Anbar, Iraq's largest province, as well as the Syrian town of Tadmur and the neighbouring ancient ruins of Palmyra.\nIS fighters took control of Iraq's second city Mosul a year ago.\nInside Mosul: Life under IS control\nOn the front line in battle for Mosul\nFootage reveals IS regime in Mosul\nWhat has happened since the fall of Mosul?\nThe US National Security Council said it was now \"considering a range of options to accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces\".\n\"Those options include sending additional trainers,\" spokesman Alistair Baskey said.\nGeneral Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told journalists on a visit to Jerusalem that there would be no fundamental change to Mr Obama's military strategy in Iraq.\nBut, he added, the service chiefs had \"made some recommendations on potential enhancements to the training and equip mission\".\nAnalysis: Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nSending more US trainers may ultimately help to build a new Iraqi military but for many analysts the problem remains: The US strategy is not so much incomplete, as President Obama admits, but failing.\nSo how might it be done differently?\nGeneral David Petraeus, the architect behind the strategy that helped to defeat Islamic State's  predecessor, told me in a BBC interview earlier this month that the US needed to furnish much closer support to the Iraqis both at the government level in Baghdad and on the ground.\nHe did not rule out sending US forward air controllers to the front line, for example.\nAnd he made it clear that in his view Iraqi troops could fight and win, but they needed to know that the US and its allies \"had their back\", ie, that air power support was just a call away.\nThe plan follows months of behind-the-scenes debate within the White House on how to retake Mosul and Ramadi, the New York Times reports.\nUS officials believe a major factor in the fall of Ramadi was a lack of training of Iraqi forces.\nThere are currently around 3,000 US military personnel, including trainers and advisers, in Iraq.\nThe United Kingdom said earlier this week it will send an extra 125 troops, taking the number of UK personnel training Iraqi security forces to 275.\nMr Obama said on Monday that the US did not have a complete strategy in Iraq \"because it requires commitments on the part of Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place\".\nHe said that US staff in Iraq sometimes found themselves with \"more training capacity than we've got recruits\".\nMr Obama said it was important to draw Sunni Muslims into the fight against IS as they are \"willing and prepared to fight... but it has not been happening as fast as it needs to\".\nIraq has become increasingly reliant on Iranian-backed Shia militias to take on IS in recent months.\nThe move has raised fears of worsening sectarian tensions as the militias try to drive the jihadist fighters out of predominantly Sunni areas like Anbar.", "summary": "US President Barack

following year when, with the help of automatic number plate recognition and mobile phone data, police were able to track a van to Newton Abbot.\nThere they found 4kg of cocaine, 1kg of amphetamine and 1kg of BZP.\nA police spokesperson said the real significance of that seizure was that it suggested similar sized shipments were being brought into the area at least once every two weeks.\nThe linchpin of the drugs operation, according to police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), was Blake Donnellan, who was from Manchester but was living in Cornwall.\nCPS spokeswoman Ann Reddrop

year, 26-year-old Donnellan, from Downs View, Bude, was jailed for 15 years at Plymouth Crown Court for his part in the drugs operation.\nHe was sentenced on Friday to a further six years to be served

The Govia bid to continue running the services was unsuccessful.\nLondon Midland's contract was extended by the government in 2013, despite criticism for record delays to its services.\nThe company was forced to offer a \u00a37m package of compensation to season ticket holders affected by the disruption.\nMore on this and other Birmingham and Black Country news\nAbellio UK managing director Dominic Booth said: \"We are delighted to have been announced as preferred bidder for the West Midlands franchise, driving growth in one of the most exciting regions in the country.\n\"We will be investing nearly \u00a31 billion into the network, delivering new trains, better stations and a whole host of other benefits for passengers.\"\nPassengers can see how their lines will change on the Department for Transport website.\nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was \"great news\" for passengers.\n\"This shows we are delivering on our commitment to build a railway that works for everyone,\" he said.\nTrains running only in the West Midlands area will be jointly managed by the DfT and West Midlands Rail (WMR), a consortium of 16 local councils.\nDirect services will continue from Birmingham New Street to London Euston under the new franchise, the Dft confirmed. A direct service from Stoke-on-Trent to Euston will cease.\nThe overall pricing of tickets will be determined by the operator, but it will retain the right to sell cheap tickets, the Dft said.\nThe deal with West Midlands Trains will run until March 2026.\nPassengers reacted to the news on social media:\nThe current workforce of 2,400 will pass to the new operator when the franchise is taken over, a spokesperson for Abellio confirmed.\nThe company has also pledged to invest \u00a313m on staff training and development and will create more than 900 new apprenticeships over the course of the franchise.\nWest Midlands Trains Ltd said the new franchise would bring \"much welcomed investment in new services and extra capacity across the network\".\nManaging director Patrick Verwer, said: \"We have created a strong foundation for the new operators to build on.\n\"During the months ahead we will continue to work with West Midlands Trains Ltd, the DfT and all our stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition into the new franchise.\"\nWhat questions do you have about this story?

Waters, Wright and Mason had met while studying at the Regent Street Polytechnic.\nBarrett left three years later after one album and was replaced by guitarist David Gilmour.\nThe band has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide - including 1973's The Dark Side Of The Moon, which stayed in the US album chart for more than a decade.\nDrummer Mason attended the launch at the London museum, which flew a giant inflatable pig over its roof for the occasion - like the one pictured above Battersea Power Station on the cover of the 1977  album Animals.\nMason said the other remaining members of the band are collaborating with the show - despite the fact he was the only one present at the launch.\n\"There was a school of thought that I'd been not enormously excited about it but that's not quite true,\" he said. \"Maybe it was one of the others. I'd always seen it as possible.\n\"I did think we'd be short of material. That's turned out to be entirely incorrect. I can't tell you how much stuff won't fit in.\n\"We seem to have a bit of everything. My favourite drumkits. Quite a lot of the old machinery that we used for recording - that's now completely obsolete with all the digital technology.\"\nHipgnosis, Pink Floyd's creative director which designed the cover for The Dark Side of the Moon, and Stufish, which created the band's sets, are working on the show.\nV&A director Martin Roth said: \"The V&A is perfectly placed to exhibit the work of a band that is as recognisable for its unique visual imagery as for its music.\n\"Pink Floyd is an impressive and enduring British design story of creative success. Alongside creating extraordinary music, they have for over five decades been pioneers in uniting sound and vision, from their earliest 1960s performances with experimental light shows, through their spectacular stadium rock shows, to their consistently iconic album covers.\"\nThe exhibition will also include items from stage performances, as well as instruments, handwritten lyrics, architectural drawings and psychedelic posters.\nAfter it was announced in 2012, the V&A's David Bowie exhibition became the fastest-selling in the museum's history.\nThe Pink Floyd Exhibition: Their Mortal Remains runs from May 13 to October 1 next year.

council and health budgets.\nThe Tories said this was a \"double counting con\" by the finance secretary.\nThe government said the budget would give councils extra spending power.\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour claimed the budget had become a \"total shambles\" after revised funding allocations had to be sent out to councils.\nA political row broke out over the draft budget as soon as it was announced by Derek Mackay, with opposition parties claiming council funds had been cut despite Mr Mackay claiming a \u00a3240m boost for local services.\nThe core grant for councils was reduced in the budget, but the government argued this was more than offset by funds for local services such as schools and health and social care partnerships, along with potential increases to council tax - although it is down to individual councils whether to raise taxes.\nA budget briefing by the impartial Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Spice) pointed out that \u00a3107m of social care funds cited by the government for local services were \"already included in the health budget totals\".\nThis means the same funds have been used to contribute to a growth in both the health budget and the local services budget.\nThe Fraser of Allander Institute, an economic think tank based at the Unviersity of Strathclyde, said this was \"highly controversial\".\nThey wrote: \"The funding for this actually already appears in the health budget lines - indeed it is fundamental to the government's commitment to increase the health budget in real terms.\n\"But the government often double counts this as spending on local services. Clearly this isn't right, it either has to be one or the other.\n\"There can be some justification for the additional \u00a3107m being viewed - in part - as resource for local services as a large chunk will be used to support the living wage for social care workers in local authorities.\n\"But if this is the case, then the money should be deducted from the health budget line and thereby reduce the level of investment in that major manifesto commitment. You cannot have it both ways.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the government had been \"found out\" over a \"double accounting con\".\nFinance spokesman Murdo Fraser said Mr Mackay had \"signed off on the kind of creative accountancy that would make Fred Goodwin blush\".\nHe added: \"NHS money has been double counted as cash for local councils. And the SNP has simply banked 3% council tax rises everywhere in Scotland, even though this is for local authorities to decide.\"\nScottish Labour meanwhile highlighted revisions to funding allocations sent out to councils over the weekend.\nThe party's deputy leader Alex Rowley said: \"The SNP's budget has now become a total shambles.

What was the money used for?\nThe attorney general said Mr Najib had returned $620m, but that begs the question - where did the other $61m go?\nLeaders from Umno, Mr Najib's party, have claimed the donation funded party activities including the campaign for the 2013 election, but critics have alleged it was used to buy political support within the leadership and for Mr Najib's personal use.\nSome Malaysians have pointed to the fact that the new attorney general is a recent appointment - replaced after Mr Najib kicked his predecessor out over this very same drama.\nThe scandal has cast an ugly shadow over Mr Najib's seven-year leadership. But this decision effectively clears him, which political analysts say will secure his position within his own party and the country for now.\nMalaysia's 'mysterious millions' - case solved?\n1MDB: The case riveting Malaysia\nMalaysia held its last general election in May 2013, which returned Mr Najib's party to power but with one of its poorest showings on record.\nThe attorney general also said no criminal offence was committed by Mr Najib in relation to three other related investigations and that no further action would be taken.\nMr Najib said the findings \"confirmed what I have maintained all along, that no crime was committed\".\nHe urged the country to \"unite and move on\", saying the controversy had been \"an unnecessary distraction\".\nOpposition members, however, criticised the prosecutor's decision.\nLim Kit Siang, parliamentary leader of Malaysia's main opposition party, Democratic Action, told the BBC it came as \"a great surprise... that the attorney general can exonerate the prime minister for the $680m scandal\".\n\"Nobody would give that donation for nothing,\" he added, and said the attorney general had to provide more evidence to justify his decision.\nMeanwhile, activist group Transparency International said several questions remained: \"Where did it [the money] go and why was this personal donation made?\"", "summary": "Malaysia's top prosecutor has cleared Prime Minister Najib Razak of corruption in a long-running financial scandal that has gripped the nation.", "id": "35407017", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe attorney-general's office said the $681m (\u00a3479m) that Mr Najib received in his bank account was a personal donation from the Saudi royal family.

The attackers have struck in Jerusalem and central and northern Israel, and in the occupied West Bank. Israel has tightened security and its security forces have clashed with rioting Palestinians, leading to deaths on the Palestinian side. The violence has also spread to the border with Gaza.\nAfter a period of relative quiet, violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. It was fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter a long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank and the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other's communities.\nThere have been two organised uprisings by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, in the 1980s and early 2000s. With peace talks moribund, some observers have questioned whether we are now seeing a third. The stabbing attacks seem to be opportunistic and although they have been praised by militant groups, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Palestinians are not interested in a further escalation.\nWhat is driving the latest violence?", "summary": "US Secretary of State John Kerry is to meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders this week amid a surge in violence.", "id": "34565819", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "What is the history of the conflict?\nWhat is the current situation?

The atoms are linked together in alternating patterns of hexagons and pentagons that, on the molecular scale, look exactly like a football.\nThey belong to a class of molecules called buckminsterfullerenes - named after the architect Richard Buckminster Fuller, who developed the geodesic dome design that they so closely resemble.\nThe research group, led by Jan Cami from the University of Western Ontario in Canada, made its discovery using Nasa's Spitzer infrared telescope.\nProfessor Cami and his colleagues were not specifically looking for buckyballs, but spotted their unmistakable infrared \"signature\".\n\"They oscillate and vibrate in lots of different ways, and in doing so they interact with infrared light at very specific wavelengths,\" explained Professor Cami.\nWhen the telescope detected emissions at those wavelengths, Professor Cami knew he was looking a signal from the largest molecules ever found in space.\n\"Some of my undergraduate students call me a world record holder,\" he told BBC News. \"But I don't think there's a record for that.\"\nThe signal came from a star in the southern hemisphere constellation of Ara, 6,500 light-years away.\nProfessor Cami said the discovery was perhaps not surprising, but was \"very exciting\".\n\"Lots of scientists have expected that they would exist in space, because they are amongst the most stable and durable of materials,\" he said.\n\"So once they've formed in space, would be very hard to destroy them.\n\"But this is clear evidence of an entirely new class of molecule existing there.\"\nThe researchers now want to find out what fraction of the Universe's carbon might be \"locked up\" in these spheres.\nThey also want to use the known properties of buckyballs to gain a better understanding of physical and chemical processes in space.\nThe discovery may even help shed light on other unexplained chemical signatures that have already been detected in cosmic dust.\nBack on Earth, the discovery of buckyballs' existence was also accidental. Researchers were attempting to simulate conditions in the atmospheres of ageing, carbon-rich giant stars, in which chains of carbon had been detected.\n\"The experiments were set up to make those long carbon chains, and then something unexpected came out - these soccer ball type molecules, which just looked weird,\" said Professor Cami.\n\"And now it turns out that those conditions that were deliberately created in a laboratory actually occur in space too - we just had to look in the right place.\"\nSir Harry Kroto, now at Florida State University in the US, shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of buckyballs.\nHe commented: \"This most exciting breakthrough provides convincing evidence that the buckyball has, as I long suspected, existed since time immemorial in the dark recesses of our galaxy.\n\"It's so beautiful that it's been hiding from us and it took an experiment trying to uncover what was going on in stars to find it.\"\nHe told BBC News: \"All the carbon in your body came from star dust, so at one time some that carbon may have been in the form of buckyballs.\"", "summary": "Scientists have detected the largest molecules ever seen in space, in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a distant star.", "id": "10730280", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The researchers report their findings in the journal Science.\"\nThe researchers report their findings in the journal Science.\nThe researchers report their findings in the journal Science.

'I'm still going, I'm still beautiful, I'm still doing my daily routine, you haven't got me yet Hitler'.\"\nMs Clapp said there was an \"explosion\" in the number of products available after the war.\nBeauty products were often promoted as a way of getting male attention, with one slogan telling women: \"Someone is always looking at you. Stay lovely always.\"\nBut later the focus changed to women's self-expression and style.\n\"Suddenly there's a shift in the 70s where it's much more about them doing it to make yourself feel good,\" said Ms Clapp.\n\"And this seems to be a theme that's carried on and it's still really what we would think of today, as the reason why we put make-up on every day.\"\n\"Certainly the idea of looking good for men seems to have completely disappeared over the last several decades and I don't think that's going to be coming back,\" said Dr Hornsey.\nThe exhibition is at the Weston Gallery at Nottingham Lakeside Arts until 17 April and a series of free talks is also being held to accompany it.", "summary": "The history of the Boots No7 beauty brand and how it evolved alongside social changes affecting women is being explored in a new exhibition.", "id": "35324936", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe exhibition is being held to mark 80 years of the brand, which was launched by the Nottingham-based company in 1935.\nIn Victorian times, colour cosmetics had been considered a form of", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe exhibition is being held to mark 80 years of the brand, which was launched by the Nottingham-based company in 1935.\nIn Victorian times, colour cosmetics had been considered a form of", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe exhibition is being held to mark 80 years of the brand, which was launched by the Nottingham-based company in 1935.\nIn Victorian times, colour cosmetics had been considered a form of", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe exhibition is being held to mark 80 years of the brand, which was launched by the Nottingham-based company in 1935.\nIn Victorian times, colour cosmetics had been considered a form of", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe exhibition is being held to mark 80 years of the brand, which was launched by the Nottingham-based company in 1935.\nIn Victorian times, colour cosmetics had been considered a form of", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\n\"Certainly the idea of looking good for men seems to have completely disappeared over the last several decades and I don't think that's going to be coming back,\" said Dr Hornsey.\n\"Certainly the idea", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\n\"The exhibition is about the history of make-up and the history of women's make-up in particular, and how it's changed over time.\n\"It's also about the history of women's make-up", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe exhibition is at the Weston Gallery at Nottingham Lakeside Arts until 17 April and a series of free talks is also being held to accompany it.\nThe exhibition is at the Weston Gallery at Notting", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe exhibition is at the Weston Gallery at Nottingham Lakeside Arts until 17 April and a series of free talks is also being held to accompany it.\nThe exhibition is at the Weston Gallery at Notting", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\n1.

al-Abadi, as an \"enormous opportunity\".\n\"He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the... situation is moving in the right direction,\" Mr Obama said.\nMr Abadi, a deputy speaker of parliament, has been asked by the Iraqi president to form a new government.\nCurrent Prime Minister Nouri Maliki, whose coalition won the most seats in April's election, had vowed to contest the move in court, describing it as a violation of the constitution.\nHowever, reports coming out of Baghdad on Thursday evening, and attributed to MPs, said Mr Maliki was to address the nation, announcing he would stand aside in favour of Mr Abadi.\nIraq's Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Mr Maliki had no choice but to \"accept the wishes of the majority

The pocket created for the pacemaker is also liable to infection.\nBy contrast the Nanostim pacemaker is delivered via a catheter inserted through the femoral vein near the groin.\nIt has a built-in battery, smaller than an AAA battery, that lasts between nine and 13 years. Eliminating the need for wires lowers the risk of infection or malfunction and means that patients are not restricted in the amount of activity they do, the firm behind the device claims.\nThe procedure to fit the pacemaker typically lasts around half an hour. The device is designed to be easily retrievable so that the battery can be replaced.\nBecause the device is delivered intravenously, it also means patients will have no scarring.\nOne doctor, involved in its trials, described it as \"the future of pacemaking\".\n\"For the past 40 years the therapeutic promise of leadless pacing has been discussed, but until now, no-one has been able to overcome the technical challenges,\" said Dr Johannes Sperzel of the Kerchhoff Klinik in Bad Nauheim, Germany.\n\"This revolutionary technology offers patients a safe, minimally-invasive option for pacemaker delivery that eliminates leads and surgical pockets,\" he added.\nBut others were more cautious.\nProf Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This is a potentially exciting development but it's early days.\n\"Before this leadless pacemaker becomes widely available, we need a better understanding of how long it will last, as well as how easy it is to replace if necessary. As our knowledge of this new pacemaker widens, so too will the expertise needed to fit this potentially exciting device.\"\nThe company behind the device has recently been bought by global medical device firm St Jude.\nIt has had several wire-based pacemakers recalled in recent years.\nOther device makers are also planning to go wireless. The Wireless Cardiac Stimulation system has been developed by US start-up EBR Systems and UK-based tech firm Cambridge Consultants and uses a tiny wireless electrode no bigger than a grain of rice powered by an ultrasonic pulse generator, inserted lower down in the chest.\nIn 2011 the device was implanted in 100 patients in hospitals across Europe.\nCardiac pacemakers are used to treat slow heart rates. The devices monitor the heart and provide electrical stimulation when the heart beats too slowly.\nThe first pacemaker was fitted in 1958.

Tests included repeatedly attempting to count the number of dots on a screen after glimpsing them for just 150 milliseconds (0.15 seconds).\nAnother involved trying to catch a tennis ball travelling towards you at 35mph, wearing goggles programmed to increasingly restrict your vision, while your movements were tracked by infrared motion-capture technology.\nThis was a feat at which most of the elite cricketers excelled.\nDr. Barrett commented that a couple of \"non-sporty\" people had unexpectedly high levels of attainment.\nHowever, no hidden talent was discovered among the assembled journalists today at the British Science Festival in Bradford.\nWith collaborators from John Moores University, Liverpool and St Andrew's University, as well as links with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the team has collected all its data and started the lengthy task of analysing the results, which should be available in the next year.\nDr Barrett said: \"Our belief is - we have some preliminary evidence - that faster pickup of visual information is extremely important in sports like cricket. Better performance on the counting task and better performance on the catching task, matched with evidence from the kinematics, [would be] strong evidence that the two are linked.\"\nIf there are particular aspects of visual processing that improve performance and are specific to the elite players, such super-vision might be a natural or an acquired ability. \"We don't know whether this is an innate skill,\" Dr Barrett explained, \"because [they have done] many thousands of hours of practice.

Pembrokeshire who was told that she owed \u00a310,000 dating back to 2009.\nAmanda Worth, from Llanfyrnach who lives with her husband and her 15-year-old son, said she had no idea that she was in debt with the Inland Revenue.\n\"We received 10 letters in one day which indicated we had an overpayment for each year dating back five years for amounts between \u00a32,000, \u00a33,000 and \u00a3400 -

It was shocking, absolutely shocking. I didn't know what to do.\n\"All of a sudden you're in debt. I tried to contact them but it was a bank holiday.\n\"When we tried to contact them on the Tuesday, it took over an hour and a half to get the right telephone number to actually speak to somebody instead of something automated telling you what you want.\"\nMrs Worth said that she felt sick about owing so much money.\nFigures from Citizens Advice show there were 918 people who visited a bureau with an issue about debts relating to overpayment of tax credits in 2010/11.\nThat has increased by 45% to 1,329 in 2013/14.\nIn England, there has been a 52% increase from 12,024 in 2010/11 to 18,273 in 2013/14.\nSian Williams, project manager at Flintshire Citizens Advice Bureau, said that a number of people had visited the bureau with concerns.\n\"People find it very stressful.

It's a bit like how Heathrow or JFK have become gradually busier over the years.\nHow schizophrenia changed the course of my life\nWhy brains are beautiful\nThe researchers then looked at the genes involved in the development of these brain \"hubs\" and found that they were similar to those associated with many mental illnesses, including schizophrenia.\nThe discovery is in line with the observation that many mental disorders develop during adolescence, according to researcher Dr Kirstie Whitaker.\n\"We have shown a pathway from the biology of cells in the area through to how people who are in their late teenage years might then have their first episode of psychosis,\" she told the BBC.\nMany studies have shown that, in addition to genetics, stress during childhood and the teenage years is linked to mental illness.\nThe new findings indicate that maltreatment, abuse and neglect may well continue to disrupt the development of the higher brain functions during the crucial teenage years and so contribute to the emergence of mental illness.\nSymptoms of schizophrenia:\nLead researcher Prof Ed Bullmore, whose work was funded by the Wellcome Trust, believes the discovery of a biological link between teenage brain development and the onset of mental illness might help researchers identify those most at risk of becoming ill.\n\"As we understand more about what puts people at risk for schizophrenia, that gives us an opportunity to try to identify individuals that are at risk of becoming schizophrenic in the forseeable future, the next two to three years, and perhaps to offer some treatment then that could be helpful in preventing the onset of clinical symptoms. \"\nThe study also sheds light on the mood and behavioural changes experienced by teenagers during normal brain development.\n\"The regions that are changing most are those associated with complex behaviour and decision making,\" says Dr Whitaker.\n\"It shows that teenagers are on a journey of becoming an adult and becoming someone who is able to pull together all these bits of information.\n\"This is a really important stage to go through.

If that happened in the NHS there would be outrage.\nCouncils have responded by rationing access to care so only the most needy can get it.\nIt means despite the ageing population the numbers getting help has actually fallen in the past five years, leaving an estimated one million without any help.\nIn years gone by these people would have been looked after by younger relatives. But with families more dispersed and the children of the elderly often pensioners themselves this is not always possible.\nStephen  Burke, director of the United for All Ages charity and author of the Good Care Guide, is scathing.\nHe believes the government has pulled a \"con of the worst sorts\" by giving the impression it has solved the problem of old age care.\nOther are more generous.\nCouncillor David Rogers, from the Local Government Association, has welcomed the cap as an important step forward, but says more needs to be done to tackle the quality issue.\n\"Without an urgent injection of money to meet rising demand in the short term things will continue to get worse.\"\nWith the over 65 population expected to rise by 50% over the next 25 years, expect to hear much more about the care crisis.", "summary": "Another day, another story about old age care.", "id": "21441893", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

When they organised an unofficial referendum last month to let Venezuelans have their say on the Constituent Assembly, one of the questions asked was whether people wanted the armed forces to defend the existing constitution.\nSo far, the army has remained by Mr Maduro's side but the video that surfaced on Sunday claiming to be from the 41st Brigade in Valencia and calling for military and civilian action to restore order to the country is an interesting development. One of course denied by the Maduro administration who said that most of the men in the videos were civilians, led by a deserter.\nBut with an economy being pushed to the brink, how long he can enjoy military backing? After all, soldiers have families and nobody can escape the food shortages and spiralling inflation faced by millions every day. And with criticism being heaped upon him for what opponents call a creeping dictatorship, you have to wonder when, not if, the tipping point will come.\nMr Maduro said they had been backed by anti-government leaders based in the US and Colombia.\nThere were some demonstrations of support to the uprising in Valencia but they were dispersed with tear gas, witnesses said. Elsewhere in the country, the situation remained calm.\nIn Sunday's video, a rebel leader who identified himself as Juan Caguaripano, said that his group - which he called the 41st Brigade - was taking a stand against the \"murderous tyranny of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\".\n\"This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order.\"\nViolent demonstrations since April have left more than 100 people dead in the country which, despite being oil-rich, is experiencing severe shortages of food and medicines, as well as inflation in excess of 700%.\nThe incident in Valencia came the day after the first session of the newly inaugurated Constituent Assembly, seen by the opposition is a way for the left-wing president to cling to power.\nBut Mr Maduro has repeatedly said that the new body would bring peace to the country.\nThe Constituent Assembly has the ability to rewrite the constitution and could override the opposition-controlled parliament, the National Assembly.\nOn Saturday, it immediately voted to dismiss Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, a former ally of President Maduro turned major critic.", "summary": "A search is under way in Venezuela for 10 men who escaped with weapons after an attack on a military base, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says.", "id": "40846311", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe opposition has called for a general strike on Monday.\nThe opposition has called for a general strike on Monday.

he was playing Lord Grizzle in school play Tom Thumb the Great.\nHe said his friend had turned to him and said: \"I'm gonna marry that girl.\"\nSix years later the couple were married.\nIn his tribute, Sir Elton said Mr Taylor was \"like a brother,\" describing him as a man he \"befriended and loved from the moment I first met him\".\n\"As chairman and manager we were Batman and Robin,\" he said.\nTaylor's daughter, Joanne, said the family had received \"tributes from people from all walks of life,\" adding for him it was \"family first, except on match days\", but \"for us it was dad
