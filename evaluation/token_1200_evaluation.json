[{"document": "Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.\nBut Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.\nMs Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.\nDelayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.\nMs Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.\nShe said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.\nMs Dugdale added: \"That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\n\"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\"\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \"completely eradicate\" the problem.\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\"\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \"zero delays over six weeks\" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\nRead more from Brian\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \"real progress\" was being made.\nShe later added: \"Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\n\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\"\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\nDr Simpson added: \"We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\n\"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\n\"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\"\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\n\"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\n\"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\"", "summary": "Labour has accused the Scottish first minister of misleading parliament over hospital bed blocking statistics.", "id": "34352262", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe First Minister said that the target of zero delays over six weeks had been met.\nThe Labour Party said that the target had not been met for three years.\nThe First Minister's office said that the target had been met in", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe First Minister said that the target of zero delays over six weeks had been met.\nThe Labour leader said that the target had not been met for three years.\nThe First Minister said that the target had been met in the past.", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe First Minister was asked about delayed discharge in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday.\nShe said: \"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we'", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe First Minister said that the target of zero delays over six weeks had been met.\nThe Labour Party said that the target had not been met for three years.\nThe First Minister's office said that the target had been met in", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe First Minister said that the target of zero delays over six weeks had been met.\nThe Labour Party said that the target had not been met for three years.\nThe First Minister's office said that the target had been met in", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\n1.

Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?\"\n\"They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.\n\"I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.\nHe acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said \"it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.\"\nThe creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.\nThe unit will also seek \"new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts\".\nThe Army spokesman said it would share the \"spirit of innovation\" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.\nChindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.\nThe new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.\nTony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: \"Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.\n\"I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.\"\nBy BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale\nThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.\nThe brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of \"psyops\" - psychological operations.\nThey will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.\nCivilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.\nIt can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.\nPaul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a \"big expansion\" of the Army's psychological operations and was an \"attempt to rebrand and update\" this area of its work.\n\"We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,\" Prof Rogers explained.\nHe added: \"In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.\n\"We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.\"\nA former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build \"the Army for the future\".\n\"For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.\"", "summary": "The Army is setting up a new unit that will use psychological operations and social media to help fight wars \"in the information age\".", "id": "31070114", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe 77th Brigade, made up of reservists and regular troops and based in Hermitage, Berkshire, will be formally created in April.

In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed.  She says some of her MP colleagues are \"dinosaurs\".\nThe alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.\nReacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont \"carries my personal best wishes\".\nBut she added: \"There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.\"\nThe timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.\nIn the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.\nWhoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.\nMs Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.\nShe took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.\nIn the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved \"significant credit\" for the successful \"No\" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.\nHe added: \"She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.\n\"She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.\n\"Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.\"\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.\nMr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.\nHe added; \"She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.\n\"I wish her well in the future.\"\nSenior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.\nIf the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.\nMr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood.

I think it is absolutely undesirable for the country's aluminium output to double over the next 10 years,\" Mr Bermann adds.\nBrazil, he points out, is going back to being a producer of primary goods, without adding value.\n\"And it is precisely the production of primary goods that needs a lot of energy and generates few jobs.\"\nPreparatory work for the construction of the Teles Pires dam to be built on the Teles Pires river, a tributary of the Tapajos, has already led to the bulldozing of land around the Sete Quedas (Seven Waterfalls) - an area considered sacred by the Munduruku and other indigenous people.\nIn an open letter, Munduruku leaders complained: \"There are funerary urns there, where our ancient warriors are buried. There is also a portal, only seen by spiritual shaman leaders, who can travel through it to another, unknown world.\"\n\"Why have they destroyed this?\" one cacique asked.\nFor others, however, progress cannot be halted.\nJoao Francisco Vieira, a local councillor in the town of Jacareacanga, told the BBC: \"The Indians don't want to go back 300 years. They want to evolve, as the river flows to the sea. They want mobile phones. They want the internet.\"\nMaria Leusa Kaba Munduruku agrees that they want modern goods.\n\"But we want them while conserving our culture.

They had a son named after his father, Barack Hussein Obama II.\nI travelled to Mr Obama's home in Kogelo where I met his step-grandmother Sarah Obama and aunt Marsat Onyango Obama to find out what the scholarship meant for the family at the time.\nWe stood in the family's small graveyard, next to the grave of Barack Obama Senior.\nMs Onyango told me that even though she had not yet been born when Mr Obama left, she knew that the family had been very proud of him.\n\"They said he carried their hopes and dreams.\"\nTom Mboya was assassinated in central Nairobi 1969 at the age of 38.\nHe was minister of economic development and planning but the motive for his killing remains a mystery.\nHe had achieved a lot for his young age - his intellectual prowess and eloquence meant that he could articulate his vision clearly to others.\nAs a sign of his global significance he had appeared on the cover of Time magazine, the first Kenyan to have done so.\nOne of his daughters, Susan Mboya, who holds a PhD in chemistry, is an executive at Coca-Cola Africa based in Nairobi.\nShe also runs a scholarship programme, known as Zawadi, the Kiswahili word for gift, helping mainly young African women to study abroad.\nIn light of the excitement engulfing Kenya ahead of President Obama's visit this weekend, I asked what she thought of her father's initiative.\nShe replied in a quiet, confident voice: \"My father could not have known that by helping one person to go to school, he was going to change the lives of so many people.\n\"Barack Obama has achieved a lot personally and it's great that he is the president of the United States.\n\"But I think the biggest benefit that Barack Obama has brought is how he has inspired young people all over the world\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and to me that is the huge thing that has come out of the scholarships.\"\nI asked her why she had followed in her father's footsteps by setting up her own programme.\n\"I want to finish what my father started but I want to finish it in a way that brings balance to the leadership in this country.\"\nThe airlift scholarship also took the Kenyan newspaper columnist Philip Ochieng to America.\nHe studied a Bachelor of Arts in Literature at Chicago's Roosevelt University.\nThe 76-year-old knew Mr Obama Senior very well and recalls that he was clever.\nHe told me in Nairobi that they used to drink whisky together.\nAs he put it: \"America watered my thirst for knowledge.\"\nWhat if\nThe scholarship programme educated nearly 800 students from Kenya and elsewhere in East Africa.\nOther scholars included the late Wangari Mathaai, who became the first African woman to become a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the late geneticist Reuben Olembo, who became a director at the United Nations environment agency, Unep.\nThe partner, on the other side of the Atlantic, was an American entrepreneur William X Scheinman, who was a good friend of Tom Mboya's, and they received President John F Kennedy's support.\nMusician and activist Harry Belafonte and actor Sidney Poitier raised funds for the scholarship fund, amongst many others.\nMr Belafonte later wrote about Mr Obama Senior's scholarship: \"Imagine: perhaps, if not for support from the African American Students' Foundation, he might not have come to America,\" he said.\n\"Then who would be in the White House today?\"\nMr Obama Senior, who also graduated from Harvard, returned to Kenya in 1968 and eventually worked for the government as an economist.\nHe died in a car crash in 1982.\nBut not before he had visited his son in Hawaii.\nHe gave his son his first basketball as a gift and took him to his first jazz concert, where the maestro pianist and composer Dave Brubeck was performing.\nAnd as I left her office in Nairobi, which boasts pictures of when she met President Obama, Ms Mboya reminded me \"it doesn't take much to change a life.\"", "summary": "This is where the story of America's first black president, Barack Obama, begins.", "id": "33629577", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe airlift scholarship also took the Kenyan newspaper columnist Philip Ochieng to America.

of the government's local security committee, said rebel fighters did not \"have much time\" and needed to \"surrender or die\".\nTens of thousands of civilians are also believed to be in the rebel enclave.\nSyrian state TV showed footage of people in Aleppo celebrating, amid reports the army was close to victory.\nThe director of the UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, warned of \"real massacres\" being carried out in Aleppo.\nRami Abdel Rahman called on the international community to find a safe haven for civilians.\nRebels have now lost more than 90% of the territory they once held in eastern Aleppo since government forces stepped up their offensive to regain full control of the city a month ago.\nRussia, which backs the government, says more than 100,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting and that 2,200 rebel fighters have surrendered.\nAleppo was once Syria's largest city, and its commercial and industrial hub before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.\nFor much of the past four years it has been divided roughly in two, with the government controlling the western half and rebels the east.\nTroops finally broke the deadlock with the help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air strikes, reinstating a siege on the east in early September and launching an all-out assault weeks later.\nOn Monday morning, the official Sana news agency cited a military source as saying that the army had taken full control of the key southern district of Sheikh Saeed, as well as the neighbouring areas of Karam al-Daadaa and Saliheen.\nHours later, nearby Bustan al-Qasr, Kallasa, Fardous, Jaloun and Jisr al-Haj had also fallen after rebel fighters withdrew in the face of an intense government bombardment, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.\nLate on Monday the monitoring group said that clashes were continuing in Salah al-Din neighbourhood and other areas remaining under rebel control.\nIn an interview with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, an English teacher who is still inside a rebel-held area described the conditions as terrible.\n\"The situation inside the eastern part of Aleppo is literally doomsday,\" Abdul Kafi Alhamado said. \"Bombs are everywhere, people are running, people are injured in the streets, no-one can dare go to help them, some people are under the rubble.\"\nThe Syrian Observatory says that at least 415 civilians and 364 rebel fighters have been killed in rebel-held areas since 15 November. Another 130 civilians have died in rebel rocket and mortar attacks on the government-controlled west.\nRussia and the United States, which backs the rebels, held talks in Geneva over the weekend to discuss a deal for civilians and rebel fighters to leave Aleppo.\nBut on Monday, US officials said their Russian counterparts had rejected a proposal for an immediate cessation of hostilities to allow for safe departures.\nAnalysts say the fall of Aleppo would be a big blow to the opposition, as it would leave the government in control of Syria's four largest cities.\nHowever, the head of the umbrella group that represented political and armed opposition factions at failed peace talks at the start of this year insisted that their determination to overthrow the president would not be diminished.\n\"If Assad and his allies think that a military advance in certain quarters of Aleppo will signify that we will make concessions, then [I say] that will not happen,\" Riyad Hijab, general co-ordinator of the High Negotiations Committee, told reporters.\nAs fighting intensified for the last rebel-held neighbourhoods, there have been frantic efforts to secure guarantees to evacuate the most vulnerable - the very ill, gravely injured and innocent children. All efforts have been in vain.\n\"It's a far dream,\" one frustrated aid official told me on Monday, about a long-standing request for a UN-organised medical mission for about 500 patients and their families.\nTwo efforts, which seemed close to agreement, collapsed last week when Russia asserted there was no need for a ceasefire since tens of thousands were escaping without one.  Sources say Russia then shifted its stance. But rebel groups demanded a ceasefire and a delivery of aid first.\nIn desperation, aid agencies reduced their request from 72 hours to just three.

And the publication of the paper comes ahead of field trials of the GM moth - in which the insects will be studied under netting - at Cornell University in New York this summer.\nThese trials were approved by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) last year, and scientists have plans to carry out small-scale field releases of the insect in future.\nThe tests outlined in the latest study were conducted in 2013 in greenhouses at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire. Scientists first allowed wild-type diamondback moths to establish themselves in four experimental cages.\nThen, each week, they released GM male moths into two of the cages, to mate with ordinary female moths. The scientists found that, because the female offspring of GM moths did not survive to reproduce, numbers dwindled.\nThe results show that populations were brought under control within 10 weeks of starting GM moth releases. The other two cages acted as controls.\n\"This research is opening new doors for the future of farming with pest control methods that are non-toxic and pesticide-free,\" said Dr Neil Morrison, lead research scientist on the diamondback moth programme at Oxitec and a co-author on the paper.\n\"We all share an interest in safe and environmentally friendly pest control, so this is a very promising tool that could be put to good use by farmers.\"\nOxitec points out that other methods for pest control such as insecticides can affect a broad variety of insect life including pollinators such as bees. The GM moth approach, meanwhile, is species-specific, affecting only the targeted pest.\nThe self-limiting gene is also non-toxic, Oxitec says, so the moths can be eaten by birds or other animals with no adverse effects.\n\"We need this new technology to solve some old-world problems,\" co-author Prof Tony Shelton, from Cornell University, told BBC News.\nDiamondback moth infestations are notoriously difficult to deal with, especially because the moths quickly develop resistance to insecticides. The pest is estimated to cost farmers up to $5bn each year worldwide.\nAnother battery of tests was carried out at Cornell University in New York. These looked at whether releasing the GM moths could curb the rise in pests that were resistant to Bt, a bio-pesticide that is expressed in certain GM crops.\n\"It's not commercialised but we have (GM) broccoli that's expressing Bt proteins just like cotton does commercially,\" said Prof Shelton.\n\"Within this model system we've been able to show that the Oxitec moths will delay the evolution of resistance to the Bt plants as well as lowering the pest population. So you have this double benefit.\"\nHe added: \"If you can combine the two technologies - Bt plants plus genetically engineered insects, you can have a more sustainable pest management system.\"\nBut Dr Helen Wallace from GeneWatch, which is sceptical about the use of GM technology, told BBC News: \"This is not a realistic method to suppress agricultural pests in open fields because the insects are not sterile: the female offspring of the GM moths mainly die as larvae when they are feeding on the crop.\n\"This means the crop will already be damaged by the time the adult numbers are reduced and it will also be contaminated by large numbers of dead GM larvae. We don't know if this is going to be safe for humans or wildlife, because the necessary tests have not been done, but it is unlikely to be popular with farmers or consumers.\"\nThe use of genetically engineered animals could revolutionise whole areas of public health and agriculture, according to advocates. But is the world ready for modified mosquitoes and GM salmon?\nBut Oxitec said that the moths were safe and field trials in the US this summer had gone through an extensive review by independent experts at the USDA and a public consultation.\nA spokesperson told the BBC: \"The approval and permit covers open release of the moths, as they are benign and do not pose a risk to people or the environment.\n\"So from that perspective there is in fact no need to 'contain' them at all, rather the purpose of the netted enclosures is for scientific design - so they will be effectively contained for that reason.\n\"Essentially the scientists need a finite and controlled number of pest moths and Oxitec moths for this study to evaluate traits such as longevity and mating competitiveness.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "summary": "A genetically modified moth could help curb a major pest of vegetable crops around the world, research suggests.", "id": "33549875", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"GM moths could be used to control pests\"\nThe GM moths have been developed by the British company Oxitec, based in Oxford.

The majority of these cases are in people over 65 years old.\nOverall, human TB caused by M. bovis accounts for less than 1% of the 9,000 TB cases diagnosed in the UK every year.\nThose working closely with livestock and/or regularly drinking unpasteurised (raw) milk have a greater risk of exposure.\nPublic Health England\nScreening was offered to people who had had contact with the infected cats. Following further tests, a total of two cases of active TB were identified.\nMolecular analysis showed that M. bovis taken from the infected cats matched the strain of TB found in the human cases, indicating that the bacterium was transmitted from an infected cat.\nTwo cases of latent TB were also identified, meaning they had been exposed to TB at some point, but they did not have the active disease.\nPHE said it was not possible to confirm whether these were caused by M. bovis or something else.\nNo further cases of TB in cats have been reported in Berkshire or Hampshire since March 2013.\nDr Dilys Morgan, head of gastrointestinal, emerging and zoonotic diseases department at PHE, said: \"It's important to remember that this was a very unusual cluster of TB in domestic cats.\n\"M. bovis is still uncommon in cats - it mainly affects livestock animals.\n\"These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission, and so although PHE has assessed the risk of people catching this infection from infected cats as being very low, we are recommending that household and close contacts of cats with confirmed M. bovis infection should be assessed and receive public health advice.\"\nOut of the nine cats infected, six died and three are currently undergoing treatment.\nProf Noel Smith, head of the bovine TB genotyping group at the AHVLA, said testing of nearby herds had revealed a small number of infected cattle with the same strain of M. bovis as the cats.\nHowever, he said direct contact between the cats and these cattle was unlikely.\n\"The most likely source of infection is infected wildlife, but cat-to-cat transmission cannot be ruled out.\"\nCattle herds with confirmed cases of bovine TB in the area have all been placed under movement restrictions to prevent the spread of disease.\nProf Malcolm Bennett, professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Liverpool, said occasional cases of TB in pets have always been seen.\n\"There seems to be an increase in the number of cases of bovine TB diagnosed in cats in recent years, and the report emphasises both the wide host range of these bacteria and that sharing our lives with other animals, whatever the benefits, carries some small risk.\n\"However, human infection, feline infection and transmission between the two remain rare,\" Prof Bennett said.\nProf Bertie Squire, professor of clinical tropical medicine at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said it was important to put the two unusual cases in perspective.\n\"In 2012, there were 8,130 cases of human tuberculosis in England. In the same year there were only 26 notified cases of M. bovis in England, so M. bovis accounts for less than 0.5% of all human TB cases in the UK.\n\"The real problem of TB in the UK is caused by M. tuberculosis which arises in humans and is transmitted from person to person.  If we are to control human TB in the UK then we need to focus on identifying and curing the TB that occurs in humans, and we need to do this much better than we do at present.\n\"The real problem of human TB in the UK has nothing to do with M. bovis in cattle, badgers, or cats.\"", "summary": "Two people in England have developed tuberculosis after contact with a domestic cat, Public Health England has announced.", "id": "26766006", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"The real problem of TB in the UK is caused by M. tuberculosis which arises in humans and is transmitted from person to person.

economy had influenced its decision not to lift rates.\nNine members of its key policymaking committee voted to hold the federal funds rate target at 0 to 0.25%.\nOne committee member, Jeffrey Lacker, favoured a 0.25 percentage point rise.\nIn a statement, the Federal Open Market Committee said: \"Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.\"\nSigns of weaker growth and stock market turmoil in China have led to fears among investors about US economic growth.\n\"We've long expected to see some slowing in Chinese growth over time as they rebalance their economy. There are no surprises there. The question is whether or not there will be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown than most analysts expect,\" Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a press conference.\nThere had been intense speculation over the Fed's decision this week, with analysts split over whether it would raise rates now or hold fire.\nThe Fed's long-term policy is to keep interest rates low until employment levels improve further and the main US inflation rate approaches its 2% target.\nInflation currently remains subdued in the US, kept down by cheaper oil and a strong dollar.\nThe central bank said that it still wanted to see more improvement in the labour market, even though recent data showed that the unemployment rate for August was 5.1%, the lowest since 2008.\nThe Fed also wants to be \"reasonably confident\" that inflation will increase.\n\"The committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run,\" it said.\nThe number of Fed policymakers who predicted a rate increase this year dropped to 13 from 15 in June, out of a total of 17.\nWhen the Federal Reserve does start to raise rates, policymakers have forecast slow increases.\nThese would probably be just 0.25 of a percentage point this year, followed by one percentage point in 2016 and then a further 1.25 percentage point increase in 2017.\nThere will be two more meetings this year of the Fed's Open Markets Committee, which sets rates, in October and December.\n\"The bigger issue here was the international situation - the idea that there was a global slowdown. Between the economic uncertainty and the slowdown in China that is really what's driving the decision to keep them at zero,\" Karissa McDonough, senior fixed income strategist at People's United Wealth Management told the BBC.\n\"To my mind the Fed wants to focus on the domestic economy, but even before the financial crisis we are linked globally to much greater extent than we have been,\" she added.\nMost US stocks closed lower and the dollar fell after the Fed's announcement.\nThe Dow Jones closed down 65.21 points at 16,674, while the S&P 500 fell 5 points to 1,990.\nHowever, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 4 points at 4,893.\nThe dollar index, which compares the value of the currency with six others, fell 1.02%, to 94.447.\nIn the UK, the reaction from business groups was mixed.\nJames Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors said: \"The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates is disappointing. It lacks the bold and necessary steps which must be taken to normalise monetary policy.\"\nMeanwhile, John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Given the current global uncertainty, the Fed was right to keep rates on hold for now, and avoid exacerbating the problem.\"\nMs Yellen was asked in the Fed's news conference if protesters outside the meeting demanding low rates - and outside their last meeting at Jackson Hole - had affected the decision to leave interest rates unchanged.\n\"We value all the opinions of individuals and some interesting groups. But at the end of the day, it's all about the data,\" she said.\nA hike is still on the table before the end of the year. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that was still the majority view of the Federal Open Market Committee members - the group responsible for setting US interest rates.\nAmerica's unemployment rate continues to move in the right direction. The housing market is stronger. Business confidence is high.\nDespite these positive signs, the committee members still decided the US economy wasn't ready yet for higher rates.\nDuring her press conference, Janet Yellen gave a long list of reasons, including serious worries about China, little evidence of inflation and slack in the labour market.\nSo will the U.S. Raise interest rates in December?

There are currently more than 100,000 working in the country.\nUnder regulations being tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, migrants from all EU states will have to wait for three months before applying for Jobseeker's Allowance and other out-of-work benefits.\nWhen the new restriction was announced, Downing Street said it was unlikely it would be in place in time for the 1 January deadline - when transitional controls on Bulgaria and Romanian workers in place since 2007 expire.\nBut it is now being pushed through Parliament before it rises for the Christmas recess on Thursday to enable that to happen.\nMr Cameron said the government was acting on public concerns that some migrants from across the EU were coming to the UK to take advantage of the welfare system and public services like the NHS.\n\"As part of our long-term plan for the economy, we are taking direct action to fix the welfare and immigration systems so we will end the something-for-nothing culture and deliver for people who play by the rules,\" he said.\n\"Accelerating the start of these new restrictions will make the UK a less attractive place for EU migrants who want to come here and try to live off the state.\n\"I want to send the clear message that, whilst Britain is very much open for business, we will not welcome people who don't want to contribute.\"\nEU rules allow benefit recipients to receive payments from their home country for three months when they move.\nThose wishing to do so have to fill out a form authorising the \"export\" of their benefits. However those staying longer than three months in another country without finding a job or getting an extension will lose their entitlements.\nMr Portes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had not released figures showing the number of immigrants claiming UK benefits during their first three months in the country.\nHe said: \"It's possible it will undermine their case or that they're not interested - that they don't really care if the policy has an impact at all and they just want something to announce. It's one or the other.\"\nMr Portes also said: \"It's a bit of a mystery. A number of people have described these measures as phantom measures to combat a phantom problem. That seems to me to be about right.\"\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said she had called for the changes to be put in place nine months ago but they were being introduced in a \"chaotic\" fashion.\n\"David Cameron has left it until the very last minute to squeeze this change in,\" she said.\nOther changes announced by the prime minister last month included:\nUK ministers have declined to say how many people they expect to come to the UK following the lifting of controls but Bulgarian officials say they expect about 8,000 of their citizens to make the move every year.\nPressure group MigrationWatch UK says the figure will be much higher and it expects 50,000 people to come from Bulgaria and Romania each year for the next five years.\nBulgarians and Romanians in self-employed jobs and those employed in certain sectors such as agriculture and food manufacturing have been able to live and work in the UK for the past six years.\nTransitional arrangements in other EU countries will also come to an end on 1 January.\nUK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage urged Mr Cameron to bring up the issue at this week's Brussels summit of EU leaders, calling it the \"last chance for the prime minister to act on Bulgarian and Romanian immigration into the UK\".\nHe added: \"He must tell fellow EU leaders that the UK will not unconditionally open its border to Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January.\"\nA YouGov survey for the Sun newspaper on Wednesday suggested that 42% of people thought it was of \"utmost importance\" for the prime minister to limit immigration from EU countries.\nSome 43% of the more than 2,600 people polled said they would vote to leave the EU if a referendum was held now - 37% said no.\nBut more than half said they would vote against leaving the EU if Mr Cameron secured a major renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels.", "summary": "New rules on how long EU jobseekers will have to wait to claim benefits are to be brought in early, No 10 has said.", "id": "25421086", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe change to a three-month wait before EU citizens can apply for UK out-of-work benefits is being rushed through Parliament to start on 1 January.

There cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another dictated by either rank, or public relations and commercial considerations.\"\nHowever, he added: \"This decision should in no way detract from the extraordinary contribution that Jeremy Clarkson has made to the BBC. I have always personally been a great fan of his work and Top Gear.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Tymon thanked the BBC for a \"thorough and swift investigation into this very regrettable incident\".\n\"I've worked on Top Gear for almost a decade, a programme I love,\" he continued.\n\"Over that time Jeremy and I had a positive and successful working relationship, making some landmark projects together. He is a unique talent and I am well aware that many will be sorry his involvement in the show should end in this way.\"\nNorth Yorkshire police have asked to see the BBC's internal report, saying it will be \"assessed appropriately and action will be taken... where necessary\".\nResponding to the news, Prime Minister David Cameron said he believed that \"if you do something wrong at work there can be consequences\" and that \"aggressive and abusive behaviour is not acceptable in the workplace\".\nJeremy Clarkson took a slightly dull and failing car programme and turned it in to the biggest factual TV show in the world.\nBut this sacking has nothing to do with style, opinions, popularity - or even his language on the show.\nIt's about what stars are allowed to get away with off screen, a topic that's been top of the agenda for the BBC in recent months.\nThe corporation has had to overhaul all of its policies and attitudes towards bullying and harassment, and a long verbal tirade and a physical assault would have crossed the line for any member of staff.\nClarkson may be popular with the audience, and the BBC really did not want to lose him, but this was a star who admitted he was on his final warning and a corporation that was under intense scrutiny over what its top talent can and cannot get away with.\nTop Gear, which is one of BBC Two's most popular programmes, will continue without Clarkson, who will now become the subject of a bidding war by other broadcasters.\nThe magazine show is one of the BBC's biggest properties, with overseas sales worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a350m a year for the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.\n350 million\nTop Gear's estimated worldwide audience\n1977 Top Gear began as a local show on BBC Midlands\n170 plus episodes in its current format (since 2002)\n3 million YouTube subscribers\n1.7 million global circulation of Top Gear magazine\nWhether Clarkson's co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond will remain on the show has yet to be confirmed.\nAll three had their contracts up for renewal this year, with Clarkson's due to expire at the end of March.\nHammond tweeted: \"Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together.\"\nMay also updated his Twitter profile to say: \"Former TV presenter\".\nLord Hall said he had asked BBC Two controller Kim Shillinglaw to handle \"big challenge\" of renewing Top Gear for 2016, and to investigate how the channel could broadcast the last three episodes of the current series, which were pulled when Clarkson was suspended.\nMeanwhile, Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, has rubbished press speculation that he was to join the show.\n\"Not only is it not true, it's absolute nonsense,\" he told his listeners on Wednesday morning.", "summary": "Jeremy Clarkson's contract will not be renewed after an \"unprovoked physical attack\" on a Top Gear producer, the BBC's director general has confirmed.", "id": "32052736", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not going to be on Top Gear.

his brother Fidel as president after more than four decades, Raul has called for a two-term limit for all senior positions, although the constitution has yet to be amended.\nAs Cuba's original revolutionary generation prepares to step back from the helm, their focus is on safeguarding the system they have built and ensuring its survival once they are gone.\nThat will ultimately mean finding a successor to Raul Castro.\nSo far, though, the accent has been on economic reform - what's termed an updating of Cuba's inefficient state-controlled economy, according to guidelines laid out in 2011.\nThe most obvious result has been an explosion of small businesses, from nail parlours to gardeners-for-hire, made legal as the government attempts to cut the number of workers on the state payroll.\n\"I used to earn 400 pesos a month ($16;\u00c2\u00a310), now I make whatever I'm capable of,\" says Eduardo Garcia, who sits in a basement workshop surrounded by stereos and TV sets in need of repair.\nOne flat-screen TV he is working on is worth more than $2,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,318) - another sign of the changes here.\nBut like many of Cuba's nearly half-a-million self-employed, Eduardo has his frustrations.\n\"It's like they've released our hands but not our feet. We're working under way too much pressure,\" he complains, saying that a state monopoly on imports and the lack of a wholesale market make getting spare parts very difficult.\n\"But for 54 years, no-one thought even this would have been possible,\" Eduardo points out. \"The machine's slow as it starts up but we have hopes things will improve.\"\nTackling the big state enterprises that still dominate the economy is the next challenge for the new government that will also be formed on Sunday.\nOne new experiment will grant firms more autonomy, to boost efficiency; another will allow a limited number of co-operatives in sectors other than agriculture for the first time.\nA quote from Raul Castro on a Havana billboard states the situation starkly: \"The economic battle is, today more than ever, the principle task.\"\n\"It is a battle, and the future of Cuba depends on its results,\" state economist Juan Triana agrees, saying that five decades after its revolution Cuba is busy \"reinventing socialism\".\n\"We won the hardest battle in the 1990s, when the Soviet Union disappeared and Cuba was alone in the world. It was hard, but we are alive,\" he says.\nBut as the new deputies take their seats in parliament and Cuba's leaders are appointed, there are concerns that another tough patch lies ahead.\nVenezuela has become a key economic ally for Cuba under Socialist President Hugo Chavez, crucially in providing most of its daily oil needs at knock-down prices. Mr Chavez returned to Caracas this week from Havana where he was again treated for cancer. But he remains very ill and has not been seen in person since December.\n\"Venezuela is an important piece of the jigsaw,\" says Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Havana.\n\"What happens there determines how quickly Cuba will need to open up its economy, whether there'll be a rush for a China-type solution if Venezuela cuts the subsidies, the oil. So there is an urgency about the reforms now, that wasn't there before.\"\nEven so, the pace remains cautious. \"Without pause, but without haste,\" according to Raul Castro.\nThe goal is to adjust the system without undermining it. But the relationship between state and citizen is already changing.\n\"All these measures that make the citizen economically independent from the state are generating a feeling of freedom in people,\" writer and essayist Leonardo Padura notes.\n\"I think it's an important gain in Cuban society.\"\nThe introduction of income tax is one clear sign of that shift, as Cubans increasingly move from depending on the state to supporting it through their taxes.\n\"They are now the dynamic element of Cuban society. I think the loosening up in Cuba won't come from political organisations, it will come from the self-employed and others breaking down the barriers,\" says Mr Hare.\n\"People will think 'that will produce my iPad for me, the old system won't'.\"\nEconomic change in Cuba has not been matched by political reform. The election that produced this parliament saw 612 candidates for 612 seats.\nOne of them was 86-year-old Fidel Castro, who turned up to vote in person for the first time since he fell ill and stepped aside in 2006.\nSeven years on, there is still no obvious successor to the Castros waiting in the wings.\nA change in the choice for Cuba's No 2 post - first vice-president - might provide some hint. The position is currently held by another octogenarian revolutionary.\nMiguel Diaz-Canel, 53, is one rumoured alternative, a Politburo member who has increasingly been standing in for Raul Castro at official engagements.\nBut few real clues have emerged from behind the closed doors of Cuban politics.\nAs the island enters a decisive new term, that key question about its future remains unanswered.", "summary": "Barring some extraordinary event, Cuba's Communist President Raul Castro will be re-elected on Sunday and begin what should be his final term in office.", "id": "21544240", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

\"right-hand man\" (she is definitely a woman) and suggesting my husband \"call a man in\" to fix a leaky tap.\nThat is despite editing Stylist, a feminist magazine which promotes equality in everything from sport to pay.\nOK, so I feel a bit silly now, but it proves a point. There are many ways in which we use gendered language without a second thought.\nIt is those words and expressions, which we accept as normal, that are the concern.\nFrom the innocuous sounding \"hey guys\", \"manpower\" and \"oh, man\", to the never-withering \"mankind\", our language is littered with expressions referring to men as the powerful collective.\nAdjectives used to describe women play a part too.\nBridget Christie, or under her gendered title, The Feminist Comedienne Bridget Christie, writes of this in her autobiography, A Book For Her.\n\"When a female comic talks passionately about issues, she is perceived as \"whingeing\" or \"moaning\", she writes.\n\"A man doing the same thing is principled, committed and passionate.\"\nShe's right.\n100 Women 2015\nThis year's season features two weeks of inspirational stories about the BBC's 100 Women and others who are defying stereotypes around the world.\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Instagram using the hashtag #100Women.\nAdjectives used to describe outspoken women of status are designed to demean: we \"yelp\", \"screech\", \"bleat\", \"bitch\" and \"nag\", while men in the same position have \"passion\", \"enthusiasm\", \"guts\" and \"force\".\nI agree with Christie when she says: \"I look forward to a time when a woman's voice, publicly expressing an opinion, isn't compared to that of a sheep or a goat.\"\nThere are too many examples to list, but I have never heard George Osborne described as a \"male MP\", nor Michael McIntyre as \"a man comedian\" nor David Beckham as \"a bloke footballer\".\nGender does not come into it. Why should it?\nWith women, it is different. For some reason, we must call Karren Brady a \"celebrity businesswoman\".\nWhy does it matter? Why should I not stick with my \"hey guys\" and concentrate on female genital mutilation and the gender pay gap?\nIt matters because language defines just about everything we say and do.\nIf language is a mirror, then the reflection we see says: \"Women, we can't see you\" or, perhaps even more terrifyingly, \"Women, we see you, but you're not like us men.\"\nSherryl Kleinman is a lecturer in the Department of Sociology at the University of North Carolina.\nIn her article, Why Sexist Language Matters, she writes: \"All those 'man' words - said many times a day by millions of people every day - cumulatively reinforce the message that men are the standard and that women should be subsumed by the male category.\n\"'Man' is a high-status term, and women want to be included in the 'better' group. But while being labelled 'one of the guys' might make us feel included, it's only a guise of inclusion.\"\nKleinman cites an article by the philosopher Douglas Hofstadter, entitled A Person Paper on Purity in Language, in which he evoked an imaginary world where generic terms were based on race not gender.\nIn it, the word \"whitepower\" replaces \"manpower\" and \"chairwhite\" replaces \"chairman\".\nThrough satire, he showed that defining people by gender is as offensive and outdated as defining people by race.\nCountless studies have shown the impact language has on our development, confidence and status in society.\nThe words we use can influence, incite us to fight wars, hurt, undermine, demonise and demean.\nSubconsciously, they can also influence our mood or our politics.\nA Google search on \"negative self-talk\" produces more than 14 million results for why the activity can create issues with confidence and mental health.\nYet our negative collective vernacular on gender remains unchallenged.\nKleinman concludes: \"If women primarily exist in language as 'girls' (children), 'sluts' and 'guys,' it does not surprise me that we still have a long list of gendered inequalities to fix.\"\nThat's why I say it is time we collectively call time on gendered language.\nIf we all chose our words more carefully, we could make a difference to the way women are treated, and reflected, in society.\nSo let's forget about the \"guys\" and start talking about \"people\".\nLisa Smosarski edits the editor-in-chief for Stylist.co.uk", "summary": "We are all 'just one of the guys' - or maybe not.", "id": "34962113", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"It turns out I have been unwittingly saying sexist things for years.\nI have not been running around calling women \"feminazis\" and \"bitches\".

Korea is on alert.\nSpeaking in Seoul, Mr Kerry reconfirmed the US's commitment to protecting itself and its allies.\nBut he played down a US report that the North has a nuclear warhead, saying it was \"inaccurate\" to suggest it has \"a working and tested\" device.\nLater, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Pyongyang had \"not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear-armed missile\".\nA declassified section of a report from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report had warned there was \"moderate\" confidence that Pyongyang had developed the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile.\nBy Kim GhattasBBC News, Seoul\n'Stern test' for Kerry over Korea\nJapan readies for N Korea attack\nChinese media on North Korea\nNorth Korea has increased its warlike rhetoric following fresh UN sanctions imposed after its third nuclear test in February and joint military manoeuvres by the US and South Korea.\nThe North has said it will restart a mothballed nuclear reactor, has shut an emergency military hotline to the South and has urged countries to withdraw diplomatic staff, saying it cannot now guarantee their safety.\nOn 15 April, North Korea will mark the birth of national founder Kim Il-sung , a date which could be used for a missile launch.\nNorth Korean TV has been showing preparations for the birthday celebrations, which include displays of \"Kimilsungia\" flowers, parades, and models of missiles.\nBy Ian Pannell,BBC News, Washington\nDoes North Korea have a nuclear weapon capable of being fired on a ballistic missile? Someone in America's vast intelligence community thinks the answer is \"Yes\" - well \"probably Yes\", as analysts do not like absolutes.\nThey also think it would not be very reliable.\nThis is a deeply sensitive area and with recent history in mind, no-one wants to be accused of \"sexing-up\" intelligence.\nThe honest answer is that no-one outside of a small group of people in Pyongyang actually knows what capability North Korea has. It is also true that, as with most conflicts, there are always hawks and doves and people with competing agendas. For now at least this probably remains one of former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's infamous \"known unknowns\".\nRecently, the North reportedly moved two Musudan ballistic missiles to its east coast. Estimates of their range vary, but some suggest the missiles could travel 4,000km (2,500 miles).\nThat would put US bases on Guam within range, although it is not believed that the Musudan has been tested before.\nIn a joint news conference with his South Korea counterpart, Mr Kerry said that if Northern leader Kim Jong-un decided to go ahead with a launch it would be \"a provocative and unwanted act that will raise people's temperature\".\n\"It is a huge mistake for him to choose to do that because it will further isolate his people ... who are desperate for food not missile launches, who are desperate for opportunity not for a leader who wants to flex his muscles in this manner,\" he said.\n\"Kim Jong-un needs to understand - and I think he probably does - what the outcome of a conflict would be,\" he added.\nMr Kerry said that in his talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye she had made clear her \"bright vision\" of a peaceful Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.\n\"We are prepared to work with conviction that relations between the North and South can improve and can improve very quickly,\" he said.\n\"The world will be much better off if the leaders of the North, and one leader in particular, can make the right decision.\"\nRussia, which has expressed growing concern over North Korea, said on Friday that it had issued \"an urgent appeal\" to Pyongyang \"to refrain from actions which could lead to further escalation of tension\".\nMissile defences in the region\nNorth Korea's missile programme\nOn Saturday Mr Kerry will move on to China. He said he would urge leaders there to use their influence to rein in Pyongyang's aggression. He will then travel to Japan.\nMr Kerry said it was \"clear to everybody in the world that no country in the world has as close a relationship or as significant an impact on [North Korea] than China\", and that talks there would aim to \"lay out a path that will defuse this tension\".\nChina, like the US, wanted denuclearisation, he said, adding: \"If that's your policy, you've got to put some teeth into it.\"\nOn Thursday, China carried out a civilian emergency drill in a town near its border with the North.\nChina's state media said the half-hour exercise covered evacuations and responses to an air raid and was aimed at raising public awareness of disaster prevention and relief.", "summary": "US Secretary of State John Kerry has said an anticipated missile launch by North Korea would be a \"provocative act\" and \"huge mistake\".", "id": "22120623", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe North has moved two missiles to its east coast and South Korea is on alert.

Out of sight, out of mind, in the basement, perhaps.\nBut here's an opposite scenario: the UK is already bound by its Climate Change Act to step-by-step cuts in greenhouse gases through to 2050.\nThe new Defra Secretary Andrea Leadsom has re-iterated that there will be no deviation from long-term carbon targets.\nGreg Clark, the man in charge of the expanded department, was a Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate and has written papers on achieving a Low Carbon Economy.\nIf you really intend climate change to drive an industrial transformation, why not embrace it within a powerful department that's developing the sort of industrial strategy needed to forge a genuine Low Carbon economy?\nMr Clark's opening remarks suggest this may be the case. But the department faces formidable problems getting the UK on track with its long-term carbon-cutting ambitions.\nDecisions on Hinkley Point nuclear station and the government's Low Carbon strategy due later this year will offer genuine pointers to the significance of the death of Decc.\nLabour's former leader and one-time climate secretary Ed Miliband has been among those urging the government the agreement as soon as possible.\nAlthough the UK has signed up, it needs to formally join the agreement with a communication to the UN.\nMr Miliband had been concerned that \"climate sceptics\" might try to derail the deal if they gain positions of power in the new administration.\nOn the changes at DECC, he tweeted: \"Abolition just plain stupid. Climate not even mentioned in new dept. title. Matters because depts shape priorities shape outcomes.\"\nFriends of the Earth chief executive Craig Bennett described the news as \"shocking\".\n\"Less than a day into the job and it appears that the new Prime Minister has already downgraded action to tackle climate change, one of the biggest threats we face,\" he said.\n\"If Theresa May supports strong action on climate change, as she's previously said, it's essential that this is made a top priority for the new business and energy department and across government.\"\nHowever, David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, commented: \"The new Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy can be a real powerhouse for change, joining up Whitehall teams to progress the resilient, sustainable, and low carbon infrastructure that we urgently need.\"\nDr Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF), said: \"Moving energy policy to the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy should give ministers a fresh impetus to ensure that the costs for consumers and businesses are driven down, not pushed further up.\"\nOne pressing item in Mr Clark's in-tray is the possible effect leaving the EU could have on the \u00c2\u00a318bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station project.\nFrench energy giant EDF is a key investor in the project and there are concerns that the uncertainty over Brexit could undermine its commitment.\nSpeaking earlier, Angus Brendan MacNeil, chair of the Commons energy and climate select committee, has pointed out that pre-referendum, \"EDF was investing in another EU member state\". Now, he added, \"that is no longer the case\". However, EDF officials have said they remain committed to the project.\nThere will also be big changes to the way farming operates - something for Ms Leadsom's in-tray at Defra.

But that wasn't the case at all - we were just at the wrong door, so we had to go around the back, where we saw Stella.\nShe's a big racing fan, and I'm a big admirer of her work, so I spent some time with her - and also with her husband Alasdhair Willis, whose clothes I buy a lot of. It was good to see them again.\nI spent the next few days taking in a few of the top shows such as Valentino and the Chanel show, which was just unbelievable - I got to meet Karl Lagerfeld, who is 'The Man' when it comes to fashion. He was a really nice guy.\nFashion weeks generally are just a really super-fun time.\nYou get to meet the designers and get a real insight into how they came up with the clothes. And everyone is there and you bump into a lot of people in the business - I got to see Kanye (West) for example; I met Mario Testino, the great photographer, for the first time; and I got to hang with Miguel after his performance at the US Ambassador's Residence.\nIt's basically the best social week ever. There is a lot of relationship-building and a lot of positive things come from those weeks.\nThis week, I have a front cover of an incredible fashion magazine coming out, for example, which is a great way of extending my story to people who perhaps don't know so much about me.\nAs always, F1 is paramount and, now Paris is over, I'm fully focused on Sochi and hopefully having another successful weekend.\nIn fact, it could be a particularly important race for my Mercedes team because we could clinch our second consecutive constructors' championship if things go well.\nWe need to score three more points than Ferrari in Russia and we've done it, and it would be no less than the team deserve because they have been absolutely fantastic this year. If it happens, it will be at the same point in the season as last year.\nIt says a lot about the team that they are in this position despite our main rival being closer this year than last season.\nWe have definitely felt the heat from Ferrari at times but in terms of results Mercedes have been even more dominant.\nThe car has taken a step up and reliability has definitely been better and it is all down to great teamwork from everyone at our factory in Brackley, in Brixworth, and of course at Mercedes HQ in Stuttgart.\nTo go away from an exceptional year in 2014 and come back and have an even more successful year in 2015 is an outstanding achievement and really shows how much strength in depth we have.\nI am incredibly proud of this team. In life, we tend to take things for granted - and I am as guilty of that as anyone else - but there are something like 1,200 people in this team and I take the responsibility of being part of the group that comes together on a race weekend to execute what they have worked for very seriously.\nIt might look easy to people watching from the outside but it is impossible to overstate just how much hard work goes into what we do.\nThere were times when I was at McLaren, when things were not going well, when I wondered whether that was the way it was always going to be for me in F1.\nIt was a big step for me to leave and join this team and things have really come together for me. I feel incredibly grateful and blessed to be in this position.\nWe come to Russia after the last race in Japan - and it would be hard to imagine two more contrasting tracks.\nThe track here in Sochi is very flat, and a massive contrast to Suzuka, which is a real racing circuit, with elevation change, sweeping corners and so on.\nI like that there is a variety of circuits in F1, old and new, but I often wonder why we only have one designer of tracks.\nSometimes I think when I retire I will start designing tracks myself and give Hermann Tilke some competition - I've raced and I know what drivers like in circuits.\nI feel that quite often the new generation of tracks don't grasp the true essence of F1. I know there are restrictions to do with safety and so on but the circuits often feel too calculated.\nI don't know how calculated Suzuka was but it feels like they found a great spot and went with the flow of the land. That makes a real difference.\nToo many of the new tracks have too little character. There are exceptions - Abu Dhabi, for example, and Austin - but this one does not stand out so much.\nBut the area we are in - on the coast of the Black Sea, with mountains nearby - is absolutely stunning.\nYou can follow Hamilton on Twitter,Facebook and you can see exclusive content on his website.\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson", "summary": "Before coming to Sochi for the Russian Grand Prix this weekend, I spent a few days in Paris at Fashion Week.", "id": "34454559", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nPlease summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nPlease summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nPlease summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nPlease summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nPlease summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "Lewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above: Lewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above: Lewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summar", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nI'm not sure I've ever been to a place where the people are so friendly.\nI've been to a lot of places in my life but I've never been to a place where the people are so friendly.", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nPlease summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson Please summarize context above:\nLewis Hamilton was talking", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nI'm not sure I'd say that.

He managed to walk pass the Azeri police that guard the embassy and was admitted onto foreign soil.\nFor over six months, the whereabouts of Emin Huseynov, a prominent human rights campaigner, were unknown, until the Swiss broadcaster SRF broke the news last week that the country's embassy in Baku had been sheltering him since August 2014.\nThe Swiss foreign ministry has confirmed that an Azeri national has been allowed to stay at the embassy on humanitarian grounds and in a statement said that Switzerland was negotiating with the Azeri authorities to resolve the issue \"in the interest of the individual\".\nMr Huseynov, the founder of the Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety (IRFS), a non-governmental organisation monitoring rights violations against journalists, is accused by the Azeri government of tax evasion and abuse of power.\nSimilar charges have been brought against a number of other civil society activists - charges that rights groups describe as \"bogus\".\nLike most pro-democracy NGOs, Mr Huseynov's IRFS was under surveillance by the Azeri security services.\nActivists like Mr Huseynov and others currently in detention - such as Rasul Jafarov, human rights lawyer Intigam Aliyev, Leyla and Arif Yunus, and Anar Mammadli - have for years openly criticised their government, raising awareness of human rights abuses in the oil and gas-rich country.\nThey have earned recognition for their work from the international community. But Azeri officials, such as President Ilham Aliyev's chief adviser Ramiz Mehdiyev, have branded them \"traitors\".\nThe most recent victim of the government's campaign to silence its critics is the investigative reporter Khadija Ismaylova, known for her corruption investigations into the financial schemes of Azerbaijan's president and his family.\nIn December 2014, she was charged with inciting a man to commit suicide. Last week, she was additionally charged with embezzlement, tax evasion and abuse of power.\nHer colleagues, whom I met in December in Baku, described her detention as an attempt to silence her.\n\"By arresting Khadija, the government is sending a message to journalists and to the public in general that those who fight for truth and free speech, those who fight for their rights, will be arrested.\" said Kamran Mahmudov, who briefly stood in for Ms Ismaylova on her popular radio talk-show on US-funded Radio Liberty.\nA few weeks after this interview, the authorities raided the offices of Radio Liberty and took the station off air.\nStill in his pyjamas, Kamran Mahmudov was dragged out of his home by the police and taken for questioning.\nThe closure of one of the few remaining independent voices in Azeri media was criticised by the US State Department, the EU and several human rights organisations.\nAccording to the New-York based Committee to Protect Journalists, Azerbaijan is the leading jailer of journalists in Europe and Central Asia.\nHowever, the government insists that all the charges against journalists and civil society activists are legitimate.\n\"No one is prosecuted in Azerbaijan based on his or her professional activities or political beliefs,\" said Hikmat Hajiyev, a spokesman for Azerbaijan's foreign affairs ministry.\n\"Khadija Ismaylova has been engaged in journalistic activities for more than 10 years and could write different stories. Now there is a real criminal case based on the criminal code of Azerbaijan,\" he added.\n\"It is so unfortunate that the human rights issue is being politicised, and certain groups and circles under the pretext of human rights are trying to interfere in the internal affairs of Azerbaijan.\"\nPresident Aliyev pardoned 87 prisoners shortly before the new year, among them two journalists and two members of a pro-democracy youth movement.\nBut most of the activists, journalists and lawyers detained remain behind bars. They face long prison terms if found guilty of their charges.\nHuman rights lawyer Intigam Aliyev, who has taken several hundred cases - ranging from violating rights to freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial - to the European Court of Human Rights, is now on trial himself, with his hearing set to resume on February 17.\nThe Kurdakhany detention facility on the outskirts of Baku, where he is being held, has been dubbed \"the university\" because most of the bright minds deemed a threat to the state are being held there.\nShortly after visiting him in December, his son, Necmin, wanted to deliver a message from his father to the outside world.\n\"In today's Azerbaijan defending human rights is a crime,\" he said. \"He and his friends are paying the price for doing just that.\"", "summary": "He appeared at the Swiss embassy in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, in full disguise: his dark hair dyed blond to look more European.", "id": "30888135", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "Azerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaij", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "Azerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaij", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "Azerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaij", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "Azerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaij", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "Azerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaijan is a country where human rights activists are jailed for defending human rights.\nAzerbaij", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "Azerbaijan is a country where human rights are not respected.

They told me that she had a 5% chance of surviving.\"\nCharlotte Heath, 28 and from Cheslyn Hay near Walsall, fights back the tears as she recalls the moment she was warned her five-day-old daughter may die.\nLittle Aimee had been infected with early onset Group B Streptococcus (or GBS) which, while harmless in most cases, can lead to a range of serious illnesses, including septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis within the first week of a baby's life.\nThe bacteria - carried by an estimated one-in-four pregnant women - is passed from mother to baby.\nIn the majority of cases, babies can be protected if the mother is given intravenous antibiotics during labour.\nBut Charlotte did not know she was a carrier.\nDespite the bleak outlook, Aimee survived but has been left with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy which means that she cannot sit unaided, walk or talk.\nCharlotte said: \"I know people will probably look at me and say, 'you know, she's got all these problems, you're fantastic, I don't know how you cope', but you do, you just get on with it because you know it could've been different.\n\"We feel lucky to have her.\"\nPublic Health England, which collates data for England, Wales and Northern Ireland told 5 live Investigates that the number of babies being made ill by the infection has increased by 12% between 2011 and 2015.\nAccording to the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, 518 newborn babies in the UK and Ireland were made ill as a result of the bacteria, 27 died and dozens more like Aimee were left with disabilities in the year to April 2015.\nCraig White and Lynsey Dalvarez's son Frankie did not survive. Like Charlotte, Lynsey, 29, was unaware she was a carrier of the bacteria and was not tested or given the antibiotics which may have saved her son.\n\"I'd never heard of it before,\" she said.\n\"We didn't understand how sick he was. Saturday and Sunday they tried their best.\n\"On Sunday night he had gone into multiple organ failure and he'd started having seizures. They said they'd try one more thing and if not we'd have to withdraw care.\n\"They did a brain scan and it showed damage, so they took us into a room and removed support and he died 20 minutes later in my arms on the Monday. It was very quick.\"\nBoth Lynsey and Charlotte feel very strongly that every mother should be tested for  the condition.\nWhile this is done in some European countries and the US, routine screening is not done in the UK.\nThe decision on whether to introduce it in this country is down to the Department of Health, which takes expert advice from the National Screening Committee.\nThe screening committee is currently looking at this, but has said in the past that it does not think there is a case for routine screening here because it does not believe it is accurate enough.\nDr Anne Mackie, Director of Programmes for the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC), said: \"The UK independent expert screening committee's last review of screening for group B strep carriage found testing in late pregnancy unreliable.\n\"This is because the test cannot distinguish between women whose babies will be affected by early onset group B strep and those who would not. This could lead to a high number of mothers and babies being exposed to unnecessary antibiotic use.\"\nCampaigners disagree with the screening committee and say concerns about the overuse of antibiotics should not prevent mothers from being routinely screened.\nJane Plumb from the charity Group B Strep Support, said: \"Screening will save babies' lives, stop families going through the trauma of seeing their baby suffer preventable infection and ease the burden on our overworked NHS.\"\nThey point to a clinical trial undertaken at London's Northwick Park Hospital in which more than 5,000 women were screened, with those testing positive offered antibiotics in labour.\nFull trial results are expected to be detailed in the British Medical Journal soon but preliminary results given after the first 18 months showed an 80% reduction in the number of babies infected with the bacteria.\nMore than 250,000 people recently signed a petition calling on the Department of Health to introduce routine testing in the UK.\nThe Department of Health declined to comment until after the screening committee report, which is expected some time this month.\n5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, Sunday 5 March at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio.\nHave you got something you want investigating?

Akomfrah's video installation over two screens looks at five centuries of migration and religious persecution.\nIt was inspired while he was teaching in Barbados in 2009 and he saw a cemetery containing 17th Century graves of Sephardic Jewish refugees who had fled Brazil: \"I was asking 'how did they get here?'\"\nNeil Beloufa (France/Algeria)\nHis video installation World Domination, projected onto a relief of a dinosaur, uses ordinary people from different continents \"play acting\" as presidents, discussing different issues but instructed to declare war.\nMs MacKinnon called it \"dark but very funny,\" while Beloufa talks of \"how easy they get crazy and escalate it\".\nAmy Franceschini/FutureFarmers (USA/Belgium)\nThose at the preview were given the \"social media\" of seeds of grain to take away with them.\nThis is only the start of the voyage for this artwork in what is being called \"an act of reverse migration.\"\nSeeds taken from museums, farms and found on historic sites have been brought to Cardiff on board a 19th Century Norwegian rescue vessel cum laboratory.\nThey will embark on a journey to London and onto the Middle East, meeting more farmers and artisan bread-makers and exchanging seeds.\nLamia Joreige (Lebanon, work both at National Museum Wales and Chapter)\nThe starting point for Mathaf (Arabic for museum) from this visual artist is the collection of the destroyed National Museum of Beirut, in particular a fragment of Roman mosaic, damaged by a hole from a sniper's bullet.\nA concrete cast of the bullet hole, pictograms shot by a pinhole camera and an inventory of objects saved in the museum's archive.\nA separate video installation of a river brings social history and the gentrification of a neighbourhood.\nNastio Mosquito (Angola, at Chapter)\nPoet, musician, video and digital artist Nastio is premiering The Transitory Suppository, depicting the fictional depot A L Moore of a country called Botrovia.\nBedwyr Williams (UK/Wales)\nA 20-minute video on a wall, slowly computer-animated, Tyrrau Mawr shows an imaginary city which has sprung up on the slopes of Cadair Idris near Dolgellau, one of Wales' most recognisable peaks.\nHis narration, laced with dark humour, tells snippets of stories of the inhabitants, as the cityscape slowly turns from night to day.\n\"I wondered about this business of rapidly building huge cities in completely undeveloped places like in the oil rich countries in the Middle East or in China,\" Gwynedd-based Williams says of the work.\n\"I've also been playing this game Clash of Clans with my son on my iPhone and I've becoming a little hooked on building imaginary fortresses.\"\nIt is the first time since Cardiff-based painter Sue Williams in 2006 that a Welsh artist has made the shortlist.\nAnalysis by Huw Thomas, BBC Wales arts and media correspondent\nImposing video installations by Bedwyr Williams and John Akomfrah dominate the Artes Mundi exhibition, while the conscientious work of the FutureFarmers exemplify the prize's theme of the human condition.\nThe challenge for the organisers is to make an impression on an audience that has become a little weary of contemporary art prizes.\nBeyond the exhibition spaces at National Museum Wales and Chapter, Artes Mundi's work in communities will add value to an event which would otherwise risk entombing a bold contemporary art prize within the walls of traditional artistic institutions.\nThe home crowd will be pleased to see Williams on the shortlist, only the third time in the prize's 12-year history that a Welsh artist has been selected.\nBut he faces considerable competition for the \u00c2\u00a340,000 prize when the jury considers its artistic verdict in the new year.\nThe exhibition runs from 21

One Muslim official suggested that their party needed the funds to counter the \"Jewish threat\" in the last general election, while another said the donation was a gift for Malaysia's efforts in fighting terrorism.\nThe answers raised more questions and left some Malaysians calling for him to resign.\nThings were not always this bad for Mr Najib. The British-educated economist began his tenure in 2009 with a promising start, by pledging a raft of reforms long championed by the opposition.\nHere are some of the major promises Mr Najib made:\nThis was a national unity campaign to rebrand his Malay-Muslim dominated Barisan Nasional coalition as one that cared for Malaysians of all faiths and ethnicities.\nHe pledged to roll back affirmative action policies that favoured the ethnic Malay majority over other races, to make the economy more transparent and based on merit.\nHis message was welcomed even by supporters of the political opposition, but there were concerns over whether he could make the old guard in his party accept the idea.\nToday, ethnic minorities say they are no closer to meritocracy, especially in the enrolment of government universities.\nMr Najib's carefully cultivated image as a champion of national unity was shattered after he blamed his coalition's weaker majority on the lack of ethnic Chinese votes, calling it a \"Chinese tsunami\".\nPrime Minister Najib encouraged the public to reach out to him through social media. He is active on Twitter and on Facebook and he even has a Chinese language Facebook page to communicate with Malaysian Chinese voters. For the first time in Malaysian history, the public could voice their concerns directly to the prime minister.\nHowever, as public anger built against him, the authorities blocked access to news sites that covered the 1MDB scandal extensively and vowed to move against \"rumour mongers\".\nOne of the laws frequently used against government critics is the sedition act, which Mr Najib had initially promised to abolish but instead strengthened without explanation.\nHe did get rid of a raft of security laws that allowed for detention without trial, including the Internal Security Act. But activists said their replacements were just as bad.\nMalaysia was also criticised for jailing opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim for sodomy, which was widely perceived as a politically trumped-up charge.\nMr Najib promised to take Malaysia from a country dependent on cheap exports and raw materials, to a high-income economy.\nTo invest in these projects, he needed more revenue by pushing through two key reforms that had been stalled for years.\nHe cut back food and fuel subsidies and implemented a broad-based consumption tax called the GST, despite fierce opposition from within his own party.\nEconomists such as Yeah Kim Leng have applauded this move.\nThey say that despite some reports of businesses raising their prices, the issues will be corrected in the long run and bring Malaysia in-line with international norms.\nHowever, the latest financial scandal has renewed claims that Mr Najib could have increased revenues by cracking down on government waste and corruption rather than making Malaysians pay more.\nMr Najib wanted to take an active role in resolving issues between Muslims and non-Muslims.\nMalaysia is currently facilitating peace talks between Muslim rebels and the Philippines and Thai government.\nHe also started a programme called the global movement of moderates, which gained support from US President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\"The real divide is not between Muslims and non-Muslims or between the developed and developing worlds. It is between moderates and extremists,\" he said in his address to the United Nations in 2010.\nHowever, religious minorities accuse Mr Najib of failing to practice moderation at home and fuelling Islamisation.\nHe also alienated the country's two million Christians in his handling of a fight over the use of the Arabic term Allah.\nMr Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, is routinely criticised for her alleged love of luxury items and shopping sprees.\nA series of pictures of her holding different coloured handbags, which sell for thousands of dollars each, circulated online.\nThe prime minister dismissed these claims of a lavish lifestyle as political-motivated assaults.\nMs Rosmah also angered struggling Malaysians when she lamented that she had to pay her hairstylist $400 (\u00c2\u00a3260) for a home visit.\nThe allegations took a more serious turn when her bank account details were leaked at the height of her husband's financial scandal.\nIt was reported that some half a million dollars was deposited into her account, raising questions of where the money had come from.\nHer lawyer said this was an \"improper and outright breach\" of her client's personal information.", "summary": "A massive street rally has been held in Malaysia this weekend calling for Prime Minister Najib Razak to step down over a financial scandal.", "id": "34089324", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

It said meetings to discuss concerns about children were \"not always effective enough\" and said police \"did not routinely attend\".\nIt also indicated that information about how managers were performing was not always reliable.\nBrian Walsh, the council's executive director of people, said a children's board chaired by Birmingham City Council chief executive Mark Rogers was being set up to ensure improvements were implemented.\nHe said the authority, which is in the process of cutting \u00a322.5m from adult social care, had pledged more money to the children's budget.\nIn addition to the \u00a35.6m - which will be used to fund 12 extra social workers and 16 agency staff - the council will allocate an extra \u00a34m a year to children's services, from 2015-2016.\n\"I can never guarantee every child in Coventry will be safe,\" said Mr Walsh.\n\"All I can say is we are doing our best to provide a safe and robust service.\"\nA serious case review set up to investigate Daniel's case concluded last September that chances were missed to save the youngster and said at times he was \"invisible\" to police, NHS and social care agencies.\nNow, Ofsted has highlighted 10 areas of children's services requiring immediate action, including the need to ensure private fostering assessments were completed on time.\nMr Walsh said no-one had been sacked due to the failures but said anyone not up to the job would be \"dealt with through our normal procedures\".\nBy Phil MackieNews Correspondent\nCoventry knows it's under more scrutiny than most local authorities because of what happened to Daniel Pelka. Today's Ofsted report says many of the things that went wrong in 2012 are still not working properly now.\nCoventry only has to look to  Birmingham to see how, once things start to go wrong, they can quickly get worse. Birmingham's children's social care department has been rated inadequate since 2009, has changed management several times, has struggled to recruit and retain staff, and has seen a catalogue of high-profile cases from Khyra Ishaq to Keanu Williams, in which young children, known to the authorities, have died.\nCoventry will be hoping to emulate another nearby authority, Staffordshire. In a little over two years, its children's services department has been transformed. At the end of 2011 Ofsted said it was performing poorly. Today it is rated as 'good'.\nMany of the changes introduced in Staffordshire are also being implemented in Coventry, including creating a multi agency hub where social workers, health workers, the police and schools occupy the same room and share information about cases so they can react quicker when there are concerns.\nAmy Weir, independent Chair of Coventry Safeguarding Children Board, said they were \"very disappointed\" with the Ofsted judgement.\n\"We are determined to tackle the further challenges raised in the report in order to deliver rapid improvement over the coming months,\" she said.\nA Department for Education statement said it had been concerned about the arrangements for the protection of children in Coventry since the publication of the serious case review into Daniel's death.\n\"While we accept securing sustainable improvement takes time, today's report shows that the pace of change in Coventry has simply not been good enough,\" it said.\n\"We will now consider what further actions are needed to ensure all vulnerable children in Coventry are sufficiently protected.\"\nDr Bernard Gallagher, a specialist in child protection research at the University of Huddersfield, said society needed to be \"more questioning\" of families.\n\"If some parents are then suspected of abusing their children wrongly - that unfortunately is just something we have to accept,\" he added.\nThe director of children's services at charity Action for Children, Carol Iddon, said: \"The services that need to be maintained and invested in are the ones of early intervention so that children get support earlier before they become critical and before the situation becomes necessary for social work intervention.\n\"We could do more at an earlier stage and that would then release social workers to deal with the high level cases where there are real genuine concerns about children's safety.\"", "summary": "Children's services in Coventry - in the spotlight since four-year-old Daniel Pelka's death - have been branded \"inadequate\" by Ofsted.", "id": "26672646", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nCoventry City Council was criticised for a lack of robust management and not seeing vulnerable children fast enough.

So what is different this time?\nFirstly, that there is no deadline by which the US will begin to scale operations back. Critics of President Obama's surge say that because he made it clear it was temporary - the Taliban were encouraged to wait the Americans out.\nThe second difference is that the US will put more pressure on Pakistan to end \"safe havens\" for the Taliban, according to President Trump.\nOne analyst told me that the key to solving the conflict lies in Islamabad not in Afghanistan. But it is not clear how much leverage the US still has over Pakistan - or how Pakistan will respond to the accusations, given its consistent denial that it operates a \"good terrorist, bad terrorist\" policy.\nPakistan has grown increasingly close to China, and has already had millions of dollars of US aid withheld for allegedly not taking enough action against the Taliban-allied Haqqani network.\nBefore his presidency, Mr Trump was not shy about criticising his predecessors on their Afghanistan policy. He previously supported pulling US troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nEarly on in his presidential campaign, however, he did acknowledge that US troops would have to stay in order to avoid the total collapse of the Afghan government.\nAnd this long-awaited announcement came after a months-long review, with the president himself acknowledging that his original instinct to pull-out had been reversed after discussions with national security advisers.\nBBC correspondent Aleem Maqbool in Washington says the people who might object to Mr Trump's strategy are the very ones who voted for him.\nThey were told the president would focus on a policy of \"America First\", but he now says he wants a win in Afghanistan to make all the sacrifice worthwhile, our correspondent adds.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani welcomed the plan, saying: \"The US-Afghan partnership is stronger than ever in overcoming the threat of terrorism that threaten us all.\"\nHe said the new strategy would enhance the training of Afghan security forces.\nNato chief Jens Stoltenberg also praised the move and said the alliance, which has about 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, would not allow the country to become \"a safe haven for terrorists who would attack our own countries\".\nGeneral John Nicholson, the head of both US and international forces in Afghanistan, said it \"means the Taliban cannot win militarily\".\nBut Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid dismissed Mr Trump's strategy as \"nothing new\", telling the US to think of an exit strategy \"instead of continuing the war\".\nUS combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, more than 8,000 special forces

Escobar.\nThe country's biggest television network, Caracol, is currently showing a 63-episode drama series about the life of the boss of the Medellin drug cartel.\nThe fierce debate about the series, which began even before it started, shows how controversial a figure Escobar remains.\nColombian television has dealt with the world of drug trafficking many times before.\nBut Escobar: The Boss of Evil is not your run-of-the-mill soap opera.\nWith a cast of some 1,300, and filmed in more than 450 different locations, it is one of Caracol's most ambitious productions.\nThe series was produced by relatives of two of Escobar's most high-profile victims: Luis Carlos Galan, a presidential candidate who made the fight against drugs the cornerstone of his campaign, and Guillermo Cano, the publisher of the daily newspaper El Espectador.\nThe producers say their aim was historical accuracy.\nThe show is also the first to openly use the name of the man who once was the world's biggest drug trafficker and Colombia's public enemy number one.\n\"It was like something really bad happened within the family and we needed to wait for time to pass before we could address the issue,\" series director Carlos Moreno told the BBC.\nMr Moreno says he wanted the series to be as much about Escobar as his many victims, who included rival drug traffickers, policemen, politicians, and journalists.\nMany innocent civilians were also caught up in his war against the Colombian state as he resisted efforts to extradite him to the US.\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Escobar and his cartel turned Medellin into a byword for violence, and the most conservative estimates hold him responsible for some 4,000 deaths.\nBut Escobar was not universally despised.\nHis memory is still cherished in some of Medellin's poorest neighbourhoods, where he used to build houses and football pitches and was regarded by some as a local Robin Hood.\n\"There still are people who hate him and people who love him dearly,\" Andres Parra, the actor who plays Escobar in the series, told the BBC.\n\"He was a very complex character: a great son, a great husband, a great father, a great friend, who also had the capacity to inflict a great deal of pain and terror.\n\"He claimed to be a defender of human rights who was also able to order the bombing of a commercial plane.\"\nFor Mr Parra, Escobar's contradictory personality is what makes him such a compelling character to play.\nAnd it can also explain why the first episode of the series, broadcast on 28 May, attracted a record 11 million viewers.\nMany Colombians also seem to have adjusted their routines in order to not miss the programme, which is on every weekday night.\nBut in a country that is still waging a painful and bloody war against the cocaine trade, not everybody approves of giving a drug lord such top billing.\nColombia has tried hard to overcome the association with drugs and violence it earned during the Escobar era.\nThere are fears his rags-to-riches story could inspire  a new generation of drug traffickers.\nIndeed, as a self-made man who made it to Forbes magazine ranking of the world's 10 wealthiest men, Escobar embodied the ambitions and dreams of many poor Colombians.\nAnd, by doing so, he also offered them a rationale to justify the cocaine trade.\n\"Drug trafficking has been the promise of social change,\" said Mr Moreno.\nFor the director of The Boss of Evil, that is precisely why it is also important to make sure younger Colombians fully understand the pain caused by the biggest drug lord of them all.\n\"I know who Escobar was, but what I know about him I know because of my family,\" Marcela Mendez, a 18-year-old student, told the BBC.\n\"I was only three years old (when Pablo Escobar died) but those things are never forgotten, because of what our families had to go through, bombs exploded when they were on the streets,\" said Antonio Pinillos.\n\"I think in Colombia everybody knows who Escobar was, although I'm not so sure my generation knows all the truth.\"\nMr Pinillos said he believed Caracol Television's main aim in dramatising such a painful period of the country's recent history was big ratings.\nBut he also feels the show can help to fill in some gaps.\nFor director Carlos Moreno, the silence about some parts of the Escobar story is explained by the close ties the drug lord had with many politicians and businessmen.\n\"And there still are many (uncovered) links: political, economic, social,\" Mr Moreno said.\nThat might be why the series has proved so controversial.

The Florida-based player, who became the youngest Briton to qualify for the US Open earlier this year, withdrew last week citing \"personal reasons\".\nOf the line-up that will compete for the amateur version of the Ryder Cup, only Ashley Chesters, Cormac Sharvin and Paul Dunne are higher than Horsfield in the world rankings.\n\"It was a great surprise and extremely disappointing,\" Edwards told BBC Sport before the contest against the United States, who will defend the famous trophy at Royal Lytham this weekend.\nAt his last meeting with Horsfield, Edwards was struck by the youngster's apparent enthusiasm for the contest. \"When I went to the US Amateur, all the talk was 'when are you announcing the team', then to be told he isn't coming is disappointing.\"\nEdwards says he received no elaboration on why the Manchester-born student decided to pull out. \"No, that's it - just personal reasons,\" he said. \"Very strange, yes. I can't add anything.\"\nHowever, the home skipper is convinced Horsfield's absence will not weaken his side's bid to wrest back the trophy they last won at Royal Aberdeen four years ago. \"We have a great replacement in Ewen Ferguson,\" he said.\n\"Ewen is a former British boys' champion, a winner twice this year in Scotland and part of the winning Scottish team at the European team championships.\n\"He will love the Walker Cup. It was a very tough phone call to make to him, actually, when I had to tell him originally he wasn't in the team.\"\nThe Americans are favourites and boast a side that dominates the amateur standings. World number two Maverick McNealy, 19, is the highest ranked player in the match and one of six US players in the top 10.\nThat list also includes the recent US amateur champion Bryson DeChambeau, 21, who is also a National Collegiate Athletic Association individual champion. The team, captained by John 'Spider' Miller, features Jordan Niebrugge, who finished sixth at The Open earlier this year.\n\"Clearly they will have 10 good players but that just makes the challenge even greater and something more to relish,\" said Edwards. \"We will be inspired to perform against them.\"\nGreat Britain and Ireland also boast a couple of players who excelled at St Andrews in July, with third-round leader Dunne and Chesters, who was 12th.\n\"I'm sure they will have learned a lot from those experiences,\" said Welshman Edwards, who leads the team for the third match running.\n\"The more used you are to playing in front of crowds, the easier it does become.\n\"I'm sure the other lads will feed off that and take great confidence from it.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDunne is one of a record five Irish players in the home team. \"These Irish lads have been together for some time now, playing boys' and men's golf for the last four or five years. One drags another along, don't they?\" Edwards said.\nInevitably, Walker Cup teams are also shaped by the churn of players turning professional. The Americans are without Oliver Schneiderjans, and amateur champion Bradley Neil gave up a likely place in the home team after deciding to join the paid ranks.\n\"I've no issue with anyone turning pro because of the rewards out there - but I do have an issue with the timing of some of them,\" said Edwards, who is director of coaching for England Golf.\n\"From my perspective with the England team, since the last Walker Cup we've had 20 either England squad or age squad players turn pro.\n\"It's a great shame, I don't think the players are appreciating the value of experience.\n\"You've only got to look at the very best players. OK some don't stay in amateur golf very long, but look at Tiger Woods - three US junior amateurs and three US amateurs. Who can argue with that?\n\"If you get used to winning that really helps your transition. The age of players turning pro in the last few years has gone down, I'm guessing, by a couple of years.\n\"The game has to do something because there's not enough room on the pro tours for them all to make a living.\"\nThat said, Edwards is more pre-occupied with the forthcoming hostilities. As a player back in 2003, the Welshman completed a famous GB and I victory at Ganton.\nFour years ago he skippered them to success over an American side that included Jordan Spieth, Harris English, Russell Henley and Peter Uihlein - and Edwards believes another victory is within the compass of his 2015 side.\n\"I've got a really good feeling about this team,\" he said. \"They've gelled really well, we are looking forward to getting going. We know the golf course.\n\"They all sense it, this is a great opportunity for them to create history and become not just a Walker Cup player but a Walker Cup player in a winning team.\"", "summary": "Despite disappointment at the withdrawal of his fourth highest-ranked player, Great Britain and Ireland captain Nigel Edwards is confident his team can regain the Walker Cup this week.", "id": "34176843", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe 10-man home team will be without highly rated 18-year-old Sam Horsfield.

However, he also missed with some wind-milling right hands.\nThe fight was finally cooking by the ninth, during which Quigg tagged Frampton with a juddering right hand and a strafing left hook.\nThe 10th was a tremendous round, with both men opening up, trading blows to head and body and doing extremely well not to buckle.\nAnd the following round was more of the same, with some vicious body shots bookended by two more huge Quigg right hands, which clearly hurt his rival.\nThe previously bitter rivals hugged before the final round, which ended with Frampton showing off his Ali-shuffle, a sure sign he thought he had won by some distance.\nIn the chief support, Gavin McDonnell earned a unanimous decision over Panama's Jorge Sanchez to earn a shot at the WBC super-bantamweight title.\nAfter his victory, the undefeated Doncaster boxer said he would like to fight the winner of Frampton-Quigg.\nAlso on the undercard, Manchester's Hosea Burton stopped Hertfordshire's Miles Shinkwin in round six to win the vacant British light-heavyweight title.\nMorecambe's Isaac Lowe stopped Belfast's Marco McCullough to secure the vacant Commonwealth featherweight belt.\nAnd former Commonwealth Games gold medallist Scott Fitzgerald won on his pro debut, the Preston light-middleweight stopping Swindon's Ben Heap in round three.", "summary": "Carl Frampton beat Scott Quigg via a split decision in Manchester to add the WBA super-bantamweight title to the IBF title he already owned.", "id": "35680560", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nFrampton-Quigg was one of the most eagerly-anticipated domestic match-ups in recent memory, and the first time two undefeated British boxers had fought to unify a world title.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he hoped the intervention would help restore \"Mali's constitutional order and territorial integrity\".\nThousands of African troops are due to join Malian and French forces to help push back the rebels' offensive.\nFrance intervened on Friday after the Islamists began advancing southwards.\nFrench authorities said they had feared that the rebels would march on the capital, Bamako, creating a grave security threat for the wider region.\nOn Monday, the Security Council convened in New York for an emergency meeting at France's request.\nAfter the meeting, France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud said his country had the \"understanding and support\" of the 14 other Security Council members.\nBut he added that France also wanted the deployment of a West African force to happen \"as quickly as possible\".\nBy Barbara PlettBBC UN correspondent\nThe Security Council's support for the French military intervention is an indication of the deep concern here about the growing strength and control of armed extremist groups in Mali.\nDiplomats seem most preoccupied about how quickly African troops can get to the country to help Mali's weak army.\nThat's the UN plan, but the resolution authorising it envisaged a timeline over many months to prepare for an offensive, alongside a political reconciliation process between the government and nationalist rebels.\nThat's been disrupted by the Islamist advance and the French intervention. The plan is being fast-tracked now, with African contingents set to arrive in Bamako as early as next week.\nMr Araud said France wanted the Africans to take over the military operation as soon as possible, but he admitted it wasn't clear how this transfer was going to happen. The danger is that the Africans might not be able to take on the Islamists with the West playing only a supporting role,  sucking France into a long military engagement.\nThe force will be deployed under UN Security Council resolution 2085, which was passed in December and allows for a 3,000-strong African-led mission to intervene in Mali later this year in the absence of any negotiated solution.\nThe African troops are expected in Mali in \"coming days and weeks\", Mr Araud said, adding that the Nigerian commander of the force was already on the ground.\nMr Ban echoed Mr Araud's call for rapid deployment of an African force.\n\"The Secretary-General welcomes that bilateral partners are responding, at the request and with the consent of the government of Mali, to its call for assistance to counter the troubling push southward by armed and terrorist groups,\" his office said in a statement.\nHowever the Islamist advance and French response also \"underscore the urgency of implementing all aspects of the resolution\".\nFrance says its air strikes have forced back Islamists who took control of northern Mali last year, though the rebels seized one town on Monday.\nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the West African force would include 600 troops from Nigeria, 500 each from Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo and Senegal, and 300 from Benin.\nHe said France's involvement would last \"a matter of weeks\".\nFrance has sent about 550 troops to the central town of Mopti and to Bamako, and a defence ministry official told Reuters troop numbers would increase to 2,500 in coming days.\nAt least 11 Malian soldiers and a French helicopter pilot have died in Mali. More than 100 militants are reported to have been killed.\nFrance's war in the desert\nAid workers said many people had been fleeing areas targeted by French air strikes over the past four days.\nA spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said the humanitarian situation was \"fast deteriorating\"\n\"Mass displacement of the population has already been observed, casualties have been reported and we're trying our best to address the humanitarian needs of the population,\" said Ali Naraghi.\nFrance intensified its air strikes on rebel targets over the weekend, with its aircraft also bombing the town of Gao in eastern Mali. On Monday witnesses told AFP news agency that there had been air strikes on Douentza for a fourth consecutive day.\nMali a risk for 'new' Hollande\nResidents in several northern towns also told AFP that Islamists in several key northern towns including Gao and Douentza had either fled or taken cover from the air strikes by Monday.\nRebels of the al-Qaeda-linked Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao), said that France would pay for its intervention.\nMeanwhile, Algeria, which has allowed French jets to cross its airspace, said it had closed its long desert border with Mali.\nIslamist groups and secular Tuareg rebels took advantage of chaos following a military coup to seize northern Mali in April 2012.\nBut the Islamists soon took control of the region's major towns, sidelining the Tuaregs.\nOne Islamist group, Ansar Dine, began pushing further south last week, seizing Konna.\nThe town has since been recaptured by Malian troops with French aerial support.", "summary": "The UN Security Council has unanimously backed France's military intervention in Mali to fight Islamist rebels, officials have said.", "id": "21021132", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Islamist groups and secular Tuareg rebels took advantage of chaos following a military coup to seize northern Mali in April 2012.\nBut the Islamists soon took control of the region's major", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Islamist groups and secular Tuareg rebels took advantage of chaos following a military coup to seize northern Mali in April 2012.\nBut the Islamists soon took control of the region's major", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe French military intervention in Mali is a response to the Islamist advance in the north of the country.\nFrance has sent about 550 troops to the central town of Mopti and to Bamako, and a", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Islamist groups and secular Tuareg rebels took advantage of chaos following a military coup to seize northern Mali in April 2012.\nBut the Islamists soon took control of the region's major", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Islamist groups and secular Tuareg rebels took advantage of chaos following a military coup to seize northern Mali in April 2012.\nBut the Islamists soon took control of the region's major", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe French intervention in Mali is a risk for the new French president, Francois Hollande, who has pledged to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan and to reduce the country's military commitments abroad.\nThe French", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nThe French intervention in Mali is the first time the country has been involved in a military operation outside Europe since World War II.\nThe French government has said it will withdraw its troops from Mali \"as soon as possible\".\nThe", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe Islamists have been pushed back from Konna, but are still in control of the town of Douentza, which is 100km (60 miles) from the capital Bamako.\nThe French military intervention", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe French military intervention in Mali is the first time that France has used its air force in combat since the end of the Algerian war in 1962.\nThe French intervention in Mali is the first time", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe Islamists have been advancing southwards, and the French have been trying to stop them.\nThe Islamists have been advancing southwards, and the French have been trying to stop them.

The killings of Muslim men and boys were carried out by Bosnian Serb forces and the remarks were condemned by the Dutch prime minister as a \"vile falsification\".\nMr Tusk's remarks to the European Parliament came on the day the Dutch vote in an election in which the party of centre-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte and that of anti-immigrant Geert Wilders are frontrunners.\nThe Netherlands is \"a place of freedom and democracy. And for sure Rotterdam,\" Mr Tusk said.\n\"The city of Erasmus, brutally destroyed by the Nazis, which today has a mayor born in Morocco,\" he added.\n\"If anyone sees fascism in Rotterdam, they are completely detached from reality.\"\nGermany and Austria have also acted to stop Turkish rallies. The gatherings are aimed at garnering support for a \"yes\" vote in a 16 April referendum on giving President Erdogan greater powers.\nMore on this story:\nMr Tusk's remarks were applauded by MEPs.\nEuropean Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said he was \"scandalised\" by President Erdogan's remark, which he said \"drives Turkey further away from the European Union\".\nIn 2005, Turks lined the road to cheer Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he returned from Brussels, where Turkey had begun EU membership talks. This week Mr Erdogan lambasted Europe's leaders with extraordinary invective. What is his game?\nThe answer is domestic politics. Turkey's president is entirely focused on next month's referendum on expanding his powers: the climax of his career. Polls suggest it's close. He needs to rally his nationalist support base and the far-right, who like the image of a strongman standing up to Europe.\nWith an overwhelmingly pro-government media that hammers home his propaganda (recent headlines include \"Dutch Nazi dogs\" and \"They will pay the price\"), he believes he has a winning formula.\nThat, coupled with Mr Erdogan's notorious reluctance to pull back or bow to diplomatic norms, means the inflammatory rhetoric will continue. In the process, the gulf between Turkey and Europe widens. And that's good for neither side.\nLast July, President Erdogan survived an attempted coup. He says European nations failed to demonstrate their solidarity and he has come under criticism for the hundreds of thousands of civil servants purged in a crackdown in response.\nIn November, the European Parliament called for a suspension of Turkey's EU membership talks, and those calls seem set to grow louder, says the BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul.\nGermany - accused last week by Mr Erdogan of \"Nazi practices\" - has now raised the prospect of a complete entry ban on Turkish politicians.\nPeter Altmaier, chief of staff for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said such a ban would be permitted under international law but would be a \"last resort. But we reserve the right to do that\".\nThe small western German state of Saarland moved on Tuesday to ban all foreign politicians from campaigning in the state.\nTurkey-Europe relations timeline\nMarch 2015: Amid a surge of migrants trying to reach Europe via Turkey, Turkey and the EU agree a deal to see rejected asylum seekers returned to Turkey in exchange for aid and political concessions from the EU\n15 July 2016: President Erdogan survives attempted coup by rebel soldiers.

An indication as to how likely - or not- it might be that Britain will choose to exit the EU.\nThe majority of Britain's EU partners want it to stay and so - as an article in France's influential Le Monde put it last weekend - Brussels has been treading carefully these last weeks not to focus on issues that might \"annoy\" the UK.\nHence the reluctance to discuss this week's election in too much detail.\nWhile Europe has barely featured in the election campaigns in Britain - with the exception of Ukip which managed to link the issues of the EU and immigration - here in Brussels the UK vote is being scrutinised to an unprecedented extent.\nDavid Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017 if the Conservative Party is returned to government. Labour hasn't ruled out a referendum at some point and many EU civil servants believe the public mistrust of Brussels to be so high in Britain, they assume there'll be a demand for some kind of EU vote.\nBut the tone surrounding a possible referendum and its timing is thought here to depend very much on which party or parties form the next British government.\n\"Europe is watching,\" Sophie in 't Veld, vice-chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, told me.\n\"People here realise that national elections have implications for the course of the European Union. Everyone is sure this UK election will somehow lead to a referendum and I hope Britain has not given up on the EU. The EU has certainly not given up on Britain.\"\nThe unpredictable nature of this UK election and the possibility of it resulting in a minority government also worries some of Britain's European partners.\n\"Anything that weakens the UK also weakens Europe and weakens Nato,\" Jacek Rostowski, adviser to the Polish prime minister, told the Financial Times newspaper.\nEastern European governments applaud the UK's current tough stance on Russian sanctions. They fear anything that may dilute it.\nIn fact, despite well-known frustration in Europe at Britain often asking to be an exception to EU policies and regulations - in the case of the euro, Schengen border controls, the social chapter, the charter on fundamental rights, and police and justice co-operation which EU officials dismissively describe as the UK's \"pick and mix attitude\" towards the EU - Britain is hugely appreciated in a number of ways.\nGermany's Angela Merkel, the EU's most influential leader, has called for the UK to stay in the EU.\nOne of the main reasons from her point of view would be to keep a balance of power amongst EU heads of state and government.\nRight now, protectionist, interventionist nations and pro-free market countries like the UK and Germany, are pretty evenly matched. Germany does not want to be outnumbered.\nNor does it want to have to empty its pockets even further. If Britain leaves, it would be mostly German taxpayers, as the largest net contributors, making up the shortfall to the EU budget.\nBritain is also often praised in EU circles for \"asking the hard but necessary questions\" as a close aide to Chancellor Merkel put it to me. Such as cutting EU red tape and increasing competitiveness.\nConcern and interest in this Thursday's election even stretches across the Atlantic.\nThe US does not want the UK to leave the European Union.\nIt views the UK as a strategic ally on the inside, not just on trade issues but as a country still with a decent military capacity that can potentially influence EU foreign policy.\nHowever, Brussels diplomats point to what is seen as an increasingly isolationist Britain. Where was the UK in the Minsk ceasefire discussions with Russia, for example?\nStill, Mark Leonard, Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me that Europe without the UK would be smaller, weaker and less balanced and so it would go to \"long lengths\" to keep it in.\nWill that include changes to EU founding treaties, technical amendments to treaties or tweaks to existing EU legislation?\nDavid McAllister, an MEP for Angela Merkel's CDU party, spoke for many in Brussels when he told me there was no point talking about red lines - about what can or can't be done for the UK - until a new government has been formed and concrete proposals or requests are put to Brussels and the other 27 EU members.\nThe guardian of the EU treaties - EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker - says one of his top priorities is to get a \"fair deal\" for Britain.\nWhen polling stations open in the UK, Brussels will be holding its breath.", "summary": "Have you ever been at a social gathering where you suddenly throw out a question that leads to an uncomfortably long silence?", "id": "32586764", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

an approach that is becoming more commonplace than transferring genes from other organisms, as technology develops.\nThe gene will produce a pheromone called E-beta-farnesene that is normally emitted by aphids when they are threatened by something.\nWhen aphids smell it, they fly away.\n\"Also, the natural enemies of aphids - ladybirds, lacewings and a particular parasitic wasp - when they smell this smell, they're attracted,\" said Prof Huw Junes, one of the study team who signed the open letter.\n\"So it's potentially got an advantage in the UK and other western nations because it'll prevent the need to spray insecticide -

in fact they tend to need more,\" she said.\n\"The other thing is that they're using an antibiotic resistance gene as a marker in this trial, and in many parts of the EU that's considered quite outdated science now because you can get gene transfer into bacteria and so on.\"\nThe group's publicity material suggests the crop contains a cow gene. Its logo is a cow's head with a body in the shape of a loaf.\nThe gene in question - a promoter gene, which switches on other genes - is a synthetic variant of one found in many organisms, including wheat itself.\nThe researchers explained that they chose a variant closer to the cow version than the wheat one in order to prevent other genes in the wheat recognising its activity and regulating it.\nE-beta-farnesene itself is produced naturally by a number of plants including peppermint and potatoes.\nMost biotech crops grown across the world are proprietary to big commercial companies such as Monsanto and Syngenta.\nIn contrast, the Rothamsted letter pledges their results \"will not be patented and will not be owned by any private company.\n\"If our wheat proves to be beneficial we want it to be available to farmers around the world at minimum cost,\" they write.\nThey are inviting campaigners in for a discussion.\n\"You have described genetically modified crops as 'not properly tested',\" they write. \"Yet when tests are carried out you are planning to destroy them before any useful information can be obtained.\n\"We do not see how preventing the acquisition of knowledge is a defensible position in an age of reason.\"\nMs Harrap told BBC News that her group is already aware of Rothamsted's position and arguments and is in the process of replying to an earlier, less detailed letter.\nShe also said that the Rothampsted scientists are aware of critiques from science-based opponents of GM technologies such as the group GM Freeze.\nHer group does not oppose research, she clarified - but full safety tests should be done before crops are planted outdoors.\nShe doubted whether \"decontamination\" would occur on 27 May, given security around the site.\nCalling on campaigners publicly not to destroy crops and appealing on the basis of GM crops' environmental credentials is a relatively new tactic for scientists, and was deployed with some success by The Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich last year.\nProtests were held under the banner Take the Spuds Back.

They concentrate on stopping the bleeding, taking away the minimum of damaged tissue and tidying up the injured area as much as possible.\nPain medicine specialists, rehabilitation experts and physical therapists then all get involved in treating the patient and lessening any post-amputation pain.\nYet, Professor Andrew Rice, from the department of pain research at Imperial College London, says, treatments are far from effective.\n\"In the last century, there have been significant advances in our understanding of how the brain and nervous system respond to amputation and nerve injury, in the rehabilitation process and prosthesis technology; but in terms of our therapies for chronic pain that can follow an amputation, really we've not advanced much since the First World War.\"\nBut the Great War did give rise to new physiotherapy techniques and is seen as instrumental in the move to create lighter and more flexible artificial limbs.\nHospitals were set up around the country specifically to help solders who had lost limbs, such as Erskine Hospital in Renfrewshire and Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.\nDr Mayhew adds: \"There was an extraordinary gathering of medical expertise at the time of the First World War. It was the greatest coming together of the medical profession, who were all dedicated to the wounded.\"\nNow, Centres for Blast Injury Studies, like the one at Imperial College London, bring together scientists and medics to try to understand the damage to humans caused by all kinds of weaponry, such as a small piece of shrapnel or an explosive device.\nThe aim is to understand the impact of these forces at a molecular level, so that the cause of something as miserable as phantom limb pain can finally be unlocked for good.", "summary": "In the century since World War One, doctors still haven't worked out how to treat the pain commonly felt after a limb is removed.", "id": "29933718", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1.

but only once has a female jockey ridden in it, and that was more than a generation ago.\nBack in 1984, Linda Sheedy did not reach the finish on board 500-1 outsider Foxbury, so Devon-based Lizzie Kelly is determined to smash through another glass ceiling.\nNot that she goes along with the idea that women have it tougher in the saddle than their male counterparts.\n\"A lot of the time I don't think girls push themselves to the extent that I was willing to push myself,\" she told BBC Points West.\n\"I wanted to dress like a male jockey, with all the right gear and everything, and you've got to really strive to achieve just as much as they are.\n\"I had to do more to fit in, and look right, look the same as all the lads.\"\nThe 23-year-old rides Tea For Two in the big race on Friday and while she is comfortable with being viewed as a trailblazer in sport, it certainly is not something the conditional jockey burdens herself with.\n\"If anything I do is good for women in racing or women in sport, I always think that's a good thing, but it's a total by-product,\" added Kelly, who has been part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team at the festival.\n\"I'm selfish, I'm doing it for me, I'm not doing it for females in general - I'm doing it because this is what I've worked towards and dreamed about since I was a kid.\n\"It's great if people look at me and think 'I can do better than her' - go on then, come on, let's do it, because why not?\"\nSuch a comment is typical of Kelly's go-getter personality - and she has already made racing history, by guiding Tea for Two to victory in the Kauto Star Novice Chase at Kempton in December 2015 to become the first female jockey to win a Grade One jumps race in Britain.\n\"When I left university I just thought, I don't want to sit in an office from now until retirement,\" she said.\n\"I was 21, and I just felt that I could sit in an office for 20 years in 20 years time, and that was the push.\n\"I thought you have to take your chances while they're still there, and I'd have regretted not giving it a go in later life if I hadn't.\"\nAside from the overriding gender theme, which Kelly accepts as a big talking point ahead of race day, it is a family team that surrounds Tea For Two.\nThe eight-year-old is trained by her stepfather Nick Williams in the village of George Nympton, near Barnstaple, and co-owned by mother Jane Williams, who says her daughter wasted no time getting into the saddle.\n\"She was so young that she was riding in the arena, they had letters on each corner of the arena, and she didn't actually know what the letters were, she was that young she couldn't read,\" said Jane.\n\"She hasn't been given anything - she rides for us and we run a business, and if we don't get the success then we won't be here in years to come.\n\"It's not a gift, she's earned it and I feel very proud that somebody can be that dedicated that they actually make it work.\"\nDescribed as being \"a jockey for the big occasion\" by her step-dad, Jane says she is more worried about her horse's mentality on the day than that of her jockey.\n\"The horse is exceptionally temperamental - he likes going to Exeter, but I'm not sure he particularly likes going to Cheltenham,\" she added.\n\"We've got to get there - it is a concern because he will have a lot of stage fright that day I suspect, because the festival is completely different to any other race meeting.\"\nThough Kelly and her family are proud to be making history at Cheltenham, they are looking to do far more than just make up the numbers.\nTea For Two is a 66-1 chance with most bookmakers - but Jane Williams is surprised that the odds are so long and is targeting a place.\n\"First of all we've got to get round, just jump round - if I came fifth or sixth I'd be absolutely over the moon.\"\nThe final word goes to Lizzie herself; how will she feel waking up on Friday morning?\n\"You think I'm going to sleep?\" she responds.\n\"It's our first Gold Cup, it's his [Tea For Two's] first Gold Cup, my first Gold Cup, mum's first Gold Cup -

defensive line and finished coolly for a 10th goal in his past 10 games.\nSoon after, Dele Alli benefitted from some lax defending to score from close range and put Spurs firmly in control.\nSpurs managed the game superbly in the second half against a Saints side who are now without a win in six matches.\nIt represents a shocking start to what Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had described as a crucial two weeks for his team, who remain seven points clear of the relegation zone but in need of an upturn in form to avoid slipping closer to danger.\nIn contrast, Tottenham gave the perfect riposte to last weekend's surprise defeat at home to Newcastle with a professional performance to take them to 29 points from 17 league games.\nFor much of the first half, it was an even encounter between the sides, but Tottenham seized a control they would not relinquish with two goals in the space of three minutes just before half-time.\nIn Kane, they had the one quality striker on the pitch and he proved his class with a superb show of strength, skill and composure to give them the lead.\nErik Lamela broke on the halfway line and found Alli, who managed to move the ball on to Kane shortly before being taken out by a wild challenge from Jose Fonte.\nKane did the rest, darting between two home players before poking the ball past Virgil van Dijk, running in on goal and finishing neatly past Southampton keeper Paulo Gazzaniga for the 47th goal of his Spurs career.\nClearly shaken, Southampton gifted the visitors a second as the excellent Alli went from provider to scorer, finishing unchallenged at the back post after Kyle Walker's low cross made its way through a host of static defenders.\nDuring their poor recent run, Koeman has complained that his side's biggest problem has been a failure to convert the numerous chances they have created.\nThis was certainly the case in the opening 20 minutes on Saturday as Sadio Mane spurned a number of good opportunities.\nThe best two saw the forward's angled drive blocked by the boot of former Saints defender Toby Alderweireld, before Hugo Lloris saved his first-time shot from the edge of the area.\nHaving conceded twice before the break, Southampton failed to recover as Tottenham withheld their limp and increasingly desperate forays forward with ease.\nThey only seriously threatened in added time when Lloris produced a superb low save to palm away a shot from substitute James Ward-Prowse, but by then it was a case of much too little, way too late.\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take over at Spurs in May 2014, following 18 months in which he helped sculpt Saints into an effective Premier League outfit.\nIt has taken time for the Argentine's preferred high-energy pressing game to bed in at White Hart Lane but, with the addition of the likes of Alli in midfield, Alderweireld in defence and significant contributions from Lloris and Kane at either end, they are reaping the rewards.\nPrior to Saturday, they had given away more points - 11 - from winning positions than any other Premier League club this season, including three last Sunday against Newcastle, which can be an unfortunate by-product of such an attacking style.\nHowever, Tottenham ensured they did not add to this unwanted stat with a pragmatic and intelligent display in the second half to see the game out, playing largely in the Saints half to earn a deserved and impressive win.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"If you analyse the game and watch the first goal, I am very worried because the defending was at amateur level and not the level you need to win this kind of game. It was so naive.\n\"One of my criticisms this season is that we are too nice people. Until the first goal, Southampton was the better team but they showed us what is a 'killing mentality'. They won the battles and second balls and were more clever in one-on-one situations.\n\"It might also be about confidence, but we need to be more clinical. If you get three or four good chances, you have to score.

He told MSPs:  \"I'm haverin' so I'll sit down.\" And he did.\nAs a statement, it struck me as perfect. Innately truthful, notably concise - and eminently inclusive, in that he cleared the floor for others to intervene.\nIf only, I thought at the time, more politicians would follow this admirable example. It would seem that I am not alone in sharing that view, as witness sundry noises off during the latest round of questions to the First Minister at Holyrood.\nIncidentally, I say \"as I recall\" re the event chronicled earlier. Despite years of admittedly sporadic research, I have been unable to find those fine and noble sentiments listed in the Official Report of Parliament.\nIt could be, I suspect, that the Official Reporters - themselves fine and noble - regarded the former FM's comment at the time as an obiter dictum, heard in court but not legally binding nor setting a precedent.\nBear in mind that their version of proceedings, while an extremely accurate report, is not absolutely a word for word record. Many a politician, past and present, has been decidedly grateful for that fact.\nLord McConnell, to be fair, was not much given to havering; less so indeed than contemporaries. So it was particularly gallant of him to fess up.\nStill, back to today. The front bench exchanges were about education. Perhaps the topic infested the discourse - but the verbiage back and forwards did seem rather longer than is regularly the case, like a weary lecturer diluting a pint of material to fill a quart pot.\nCertainly, James Kelly, Labour's Parliamentary Business Manager, thought so. On a point of order at the close, he complained that exchanges involving the four party leaders had occupied twenty five minutes of the half hour allotted for questioning the FM.\nWhat, he declared, of back benchers? At this point, you could see one or two indications of agreement from across the chamber. Mr Kelly was sounding inclusive.\nBut it all went agley - as such schemes, the poet tells us, often do - when Mr Kelly tried to blame the First Minister in particular for offering \"speeches rather than answers\". That generated a partisan rumble of discontent from the SNP ranks.\nSpeaking up for back benchers was one thing. Dissing Nicola was another. Up with this they would not put.\nIn emollient mood, the Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said she would review the day's proceedings. (May I commend BBC Democracy Live to you, PO?)  If necessary, she would speak to Business Managers, including Kelly, J.\nBut earlier the PO had herself displayed eminent economy of language. Faced with an unruly chamber, she shouted:  \"Wheesht!\" A Scots term urging silence which I regularly deploy when herding politicians in broadcast debates.\nPerhaps Ms Marwick might consider its wider use. Instead of simply demanding order, might she use a haver meter - and intervene when a front bench contribution is trying the patience even more than usual? I know, I know, inconceivable.\nAs to the education exchanges today, they resembled somewhat a university tutorial. Both the questions and the answers meandered more or less purposefully through extant knowledge, with much reference to established sources. There was less in the way of innovative thinking.\nThe task of opening the seminar fell, as it does, to Labour's Kezia Dugdale - currently a senior thane but, who knows, destined for the crown hereafter.\nShe tried to trap the FM with a multiple choice question on attainment, bursaries and student debt. The answers she wanted were \"rubbish, down and up\", in that order. Unaccountably, Nicola Sturgeon declined to follow the guide, preferring her own analysis: that things were improving but had a way to go.\nThere were comparable exchanges with Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems and Ruth Davidson of the Tories. In response to Ms Davidson, the FM suggested she was looking at some means of assessing progress by primary school pupils that would provide a more consistent picture across Scotland. Details, she said, to follow.\nAnd there's more!  Those talented individuals who toil producing the Official Report at Holyrood are plainly assiduous readers of this site.  They remember Jack McConnell's comments - but reckon I got the word wrong.\nThey say that, rather than havering, he waffled. And they have found the report in question. It notes the former FM as saying: \"My apologies, Presiding Officer, I started waffling there. I will drop it at that.\"\nSo different choice of language. But identical sentiment and impact.\nExcellent. Genuinely excellent.

They have warned they could remove him by force.\nMr Jammeh, 51, lost elections last month, but wants the results annulled citing errors in the electoral process.\nMr Barrow, who is also 51, made the announcement in a message posted on his social media accounts on Thursday.\nThe message said he would be \"sworn in today at 4pm (16:00 GMT)\".\nWest African military forces, stationed at the border, are ready to enforce a transfer of power in The Gambia, a popular beach destination among European holidaymakers.\nUN Security Council backing for intervention is being sought by Senegal and the regional bloc Ecowas, but some diplomats said if Mr Barrow requested help after his inauguration such approval would not be needed.\nAt the scene - Thomas Fessy, BBC News, Banjul\nIt is eerily quiet in The Gambia's capital. Most streets are deserted; shops, petrol stations and banks are all closed. People are mostly staying home uncertain about what may happen as European tourists continue to evacuate their hotels.\nIn some areas, men are standing on the roadside, arms crossed or looking at their phones. Some told us they were waiting for President Jammeh to go and would take to the streets once Mr Barrow was sworn in this afternoon.\nThey said they wanted West African troops to come in as soon as possible. Some also told us they were worried about Mr Jammeh's actions should there be an offensive against him. But so far we have seen little presence of security forces in the city.\nCould there be conflict? - Joseph Winter, BBC News\nHopefully not. The Gambia's army chief, previously seen as a close ally of Mr Jammeh, seems wary of action. \"This is a political dispute. I am not going to involve my soldiers in a stupid fight. I love my men,\" the AFP news agency quotes Ousman Badjie as saying.\nHowever, he has little influence over an elite unit of fighters, called the Gambia National Guard, who may opt to fight even if vastly outnumbered by the Senegalese and Nigerian forces as they are from the same ethnic group as Mr Jammeh. The Gambia's armed forces is said to number 2,500.\nOne key question is how ordinary Gambians see the Senegalese troops if they do cross the border. The Gambia and Senegal are made up of the same ethnic groups which were divided by colonial borders, so they speak the same languages and share the same culture.\nHowever, a fierce rivalry has developed between the two nations, with many Gambians feeling they are looked down on by their more numerous, French-speaking neighbours.\nSo while supporters of Mr Barrow will presumably see any intervention favourably, there is also a danger that it could be seen as a foreign invasion force.\nWhy is Mr Barrow in Senegal?\nMr Barrow, a property developer who has never held public office, has been in Senegal since the weekend following an invitation to attend a summit of African leaders who back his victory.\nHe did not even go back home when his eight-year-old son died after being mauled by a dog. He missed the funeral on Monday as he was advised to remain in Senegal for his safety.\nThe president-elect tweeted and posted on Facebook that his inauguration would take place at 16:00 GMT at the embassy in the capital, Dakar.\nHe has joined at least 26,000 Gambians, fearful of violence, who have sought refuge in Senegal.\nHis spokesman says Mr Barrow's team is keen for a peaceful resolution, but accepts military intervention may be inevitable.\n\"Ecowas is on the side of President Barrow - and if he's sworn in obviously he has to be at the State House. If the other side refused then you are simply talking about a state of war,\" Halifa Sallah told the BBC's Newshour programme.\nHe said that President Jammeh had been given a letter promising that he would be given the same rights and privileges as Dawda Jawara, The Gambia's only other ex-president.\nWhy is Mr Jammeh refusing to stand down?\nMr Jammeh, who first came to power in a bloodless coup 22 years ago, initially accepted defeat, but later reversed his position.\nThe electoral commission has accepted that some of the results it initially published contained errors, but said they would not have affected Mr Barrow's win.\nHis legal challenge to have the vote annulled cannot be heard by the Supreme Court until May because of a lack of judges, so parliament has stepped in and extended his term in office by 90 days and imposed a three-month state of emergency.\nHuman rights groups accuse Mr Jammeh, who has in the past claimed he can cure Aids and infertility, of repression.\nRetaining power would also ensure he was not prosecuted in The Gambia for alleged abuses committed during his rule.", "summary": "The man who won The Gambia's disputed election says he will be sworn in as president at the country's embassy in neighbouring Senegal.", "id": "38675741", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a popular beach destination among European tourists.\nThe Gambia's president, Yahya Jammeh", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a popular tourist destination, with a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Gambia is a former British", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a popular beach destination among European tourists.\nThe Gambia's president, Yahya Jammeh", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a popular beach destination among European tourists.\nThe Gambia's army chief, previously seen as a close", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a popular tourist destination, with a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Gambia is a former British", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nMr Jammeh has been accused of human rights abuses during his rule.\nHe has claimed he can cure Aids and infertility.\nHe has been in power for 22 years.\nHe has been accused of", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nMr Jammeh has said he will not step down until the Supreme Court rules on his petition.\nHe has also said he will not accept any foreign intervention.\nThe Gambia's army chief, Ousman Bad", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a former British colony, and gained independence in 1965.\nIt is a popular tourist destination", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of about 1.8 million.\nIt is a former British colony, and gained independence in 1965.\nIt is a popular tourist", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a popular tourist destination, with a tropical climate and miles of sandy beaches.\nThe Gambia is", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "\nMr Jammeh has been accused of human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killings.\nHe has also been accused of corruption, including the embezzlement of millions of dollars of public", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia is a small country in West Africa, with a population of 1.8 million.\nIt is a former British colony, and gained independence in 1965.\nIt is a popular tourist destination", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia is a small, poor country in West Africa, with a population of about 1.8 million.\nIt is a former British colony, and gained independence in 1965.\nIt is a member", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_2": "\nThe Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh has refused to step down after losing an election to Adama Barrow.\nMr Jammeh initially accepted defeat, but later reversed his position.\nThe electoral commission", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\nMr Jammeh has been accused of human rights abuses during his rule.\nMr Jammeh has been accused of human rights abuses during his rule.

The Tories blamed ministerial management.\nThe strategic plan warns that NHS organisations in Wales \"enter this more challenging economic period from a less financially secure platform\" than England.\nBy Hywel GriffithBBC Wales Health correspondent\nFew cross-border comparisons between England and Wales paint the Welsh NHS in a positive light. Waiting lists in England are shorter, ambulance response times are faster.\nBut for the Welsh Assembly Government to openly admit they've not been as generous with their NHS funding is extraordinary.\nIt is perhaps at least a pragmatic way of preparing people for the pain that lies ahead. Massive savings must be made if the Welsh NHS is to survive the squeeze on public spending over the next five years.\nTo justify some of the changes planned, this report sets the scene with a fairly hefty dose of reality.\nHowever, the assembly government said that health spending was a \"priority\".\nHealth Minister Edwina Hart has already warned that without radical reform and cost savings, the health service faces a potential deficit of nearly \u00a32bn a year in five years' time.\nThe five-year strategic plan said: \"NHS Wales faces significant and increasing financial challenges.\n\"The state of public finances means that funding growth will be much smaller over the coming years than it has been in the recent past, while cost pressures are likely to continue to increase.\n\"In addition, the total growth in [cash] funding provided to NHS Wales over the last six years has been a third lower than that provided to NHS organisations in England, while operating cost pressures and the targets set for improving service quality and service access have been very similar in the two countries.\"\nThe admission has been seized on by the Welsh Liberal Democrats, who said the report should be a source of concern for patients.\n'Very fragile'\nVeronica German AM, Welsh Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said the NHS in Wales was in a \"very fragile position\".\nShe said: \"The shocking report reveals for the first time that the momentum of improvements to the funding of our health service has stalled significantly compared to England.\n\"If this has been the case for the past six years, there will be deep concern about the very financial future of the NHS as public spending tightens.\"\nMs German said it was \"scandalous that the health minister has repeatedly refused to ensure that money is being spent effectively within the NHS\".\nShe added: \"She has spent millions of pounds on costly reorganisations, refused to look at claims that a fifth of her budget is spent ineffectively and refused to cut the number of senior management posts.\n\"At the same time we have lagged behind England in waiting list performance, ambulance response times, stroke services and cancer survival rates.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said the assembly government had inadequately managed the NHS in Wales and they want claims of misspending of funds fully investigated.\nShadow Health Minister Andrew RT Davies AM said: \"This report shatters the cosmetic front of the assembly government and their claims that the NHS is a true priority.\"\nThe plan reveals the scale of cutbacks the Welsh NHS will have to undertake if it is to break even over the coming years.\nUnlike in England, the assembly government has ruled out ring-fencing spending on health, as this would have a disproportionate effect on other devolved budgets.\nAn assembly government spokesperson said: \"The Holtham Commission presented compelling evidence that Wales was underfunded by some \u00a3300m per year and the total level of resources will clearly have an impact on our investment decisions.\n\"The NHS has, and always will be, a priority for the assembly government - demonstrated by 40% of our budget being invested in health and social services.\n\"This has increased significantly since 1999 and now stands at \u00a36.3bn.\n\"With that significant investment, we now have more staff, new buildings and equipment, and waiting times have fallen and patient care has improved.\"\nHowever, Tina Donnelly from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said she still remained surprised to discover the level of the NHS funding deficit.\n\"Looking at the early 1990s where we had a huge deficit in the numbers of professional workers working in the  NHS and long waiting lists, we have seen in fairness, an increase in nursing numbers and in medical staff numbers,\" she remarked.\n\"But in the last year or so we know that there is increasing pressure on the NHS to curtail cost.\"\nShe said it was now time for the all parties to come together to address the issue.\n\"I'd be asking if the Lib Dems and the Conservatives in central government now, isn't it the opportunistic time for the whole of the polictical parties in Wales to push for an increase in the Barnett formula and recover that \u00a3300m underfunding for Wales,\" she added.", "summary": "The NHS in Wales has been

This was based initially on a presumed right of return of 5%.\n\"Because the last of the technology has come down so much, people are getting a rate of return on the investment of over 10%, tax free for 25 years, put on everyone else's electricity bills.\n\"That's simply unaffordable.\"\nPossibly, huge new solar farms - similar to Rhosygilwen in Pembrokeshire or the 5MW solar site at Llancayo near Usk - are less likely in future as both were opened before any changes to the commercial tariff last August.\nBut some companies are still interested in smaller sized solar parks of between 40 and a 100 solar panels, powering 30, 40 or 50kW of electricity.\nAnd such has been the rush to complete deals before the deadline, several solar parks have been completed without planning consent.\nThese businesses will need to apply for retrospective approval.\nEifion Bowen, the Welsh Local Government Association consultant on planning, said: \"There is a risk, if companies carried out development without planning permission.\n\"There is a provision for retrospective applications but it could be turned down, and each local authority will look at each case on its own merit... and balance the policies that support renewable energy against any impacts on sensitive landscapes.\"\nTwo weeks before Christmas, there is an all-out effort of companies such as Egnida and Filsol to supply and fit solar panels before the tariff changes.\nThey now have to plan for a less certain future.\nEgnida says up to 50 apprentices will not be taken on, while Filsol says it will have to lose between five and 10 people and will no longer recruit 10 staff.\nThe Renewable Energy Association says the biggest impact of the change will be on employment, with an estimated 11,000 and 29,000 jobs either at risk or likely to be lost across Britain.", "summary": "For the past 18 months it has been a renewable energy success story.", "id": "16132726", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe UK government has announced a cut in the rate paid for solar energy converted into electricity.\nThe feed-in tariff was established before the last general election, and the current UK coalition government continued it.

try.\nPaddy Jackson kicked five conversions and a penalty for a 100% record, with Rory Scannell adding a late conversion.\nJapan trailed 31-3 at the break but second-half tries by Ryuji Noguchi, Kenki Fukuoka and Yutaka Nagore gave the final scoreline a flattering look.\nRikiya Matsuda added the extras to two of the hosts' three scores, but his side were outclassed for most of the match, Earls and Conan both impressive and Leavy, Quinn Roux and Cian Healy among those taking advantage of their opportunity to impress in the absence of 11 Ireland players away on Lions duty.\nThe two teams were meeting for the first time in 12 years, Ireland having won their five previous encounters.\nThe match was played at the Shizuoka Ecopa Stadium, one of the venues for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, for which Ireland and Japan have been drawn together in Pool A, along with Scotland and two other teams yet to be confirmed.\nJapan, ranked 11th in the IRB rankings and seven places below their opponents,

weekend, but knew they would face a stiffer test at the hands of Joe Schmidt's charges, who comfortably saw off USA Eagles 55-19 seven days ago.\nFor Ireland, centre Scannell, winger Andrew Conway and scrum-half Luke McGrath were handed their first international starts, while Jackson replaced Joey Carbery, whose tour was ended by an ankle injury sustained in the victory in New Jersey.\nIreland belied the 27C temperatures to produce an energetic first-half performance, Ulster fly-half Jackson controlling proceedings and giving them an early lead with a penalty.\nIn-form winger Earls scored the first try of the game in the 11th minute, cantering down the left to touch down after Ireland won possession from a Japanese scrum and Conan made the break, before off-loading to the Munster man.\nYu Tamura landed a penalty to reduce the home side's deficit but the visitors took full advantage of Heiichiro Ito's sin-binning by adding three more tries before the interval.\nLeavy rumbled over for his first international try on his fourth appearance after Quinn Roux won lineout possession and Devin Toner fed his fellow Leinster forward.\nThe flanker crossed again three minutes later after another successful lineout created the platform for Earls to engineer a clever line break, running into empty space and sidestepping two defenders before off-loading to Leavy.\nAs Ireland continued to dominate the breakdown, Conan grabbed his first try by crossing in the corner after the ball went quickly through the Irish hands and the ubiquitous Earls provided the final pass.\nConan again provided the finish soon after the restart, picking up the loose ball after a cheap turnover, kicking through and dotting down for a comfortable try to extend the tourists' lead.\nConway missed 10 minutes of action when receiving a yellow card for a high tackle and Japan scored their first try from their best passage of play on the hour, Noguchi shrugging off a couple of attempted tackles to surge over.\nRingrose completed a fine Irish move by dancing round a tired looking Michael Leitch to dive over in the corner, then Earls ensured a try double for the second successive game by darting over after prop Dave Kilcoyne had shown pace to surge almost 40 metres to within a couple of the line.\nJapan showed some belated creative spark, aided by a porous Irish defence, to notch late tries through Fukuoka and Nagare, but Jamie Joseph's side will look for improvement when the sides clash again next week.\nJapan: R Noguchi; K Matsushima, W Tupou, D Carpenater, K Fukuoka; Y Tamura, F

Of the remainder, 20 are \"leaning to\" supporting the government, three are \"leaning against\" while 87 are undecided.\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her party's 54 MPs will be opposing air strikes, saying bombing on its own will not rid the threat of terrorism or bring peace to Syria.\nThe Liberal Democrats have confirmed that their eight MPs will support the government, with the Democratic Unionist Party saying its eight MPs will also back airstrikes.\nLib Dem leader Tim Farron has written to party members, saying he is aware many in the party will disagree with the \"difficult\" decision he has made, but he has done so because \"the threat to Britain and our allies is clear\".\nHe wrote: \"I believe it is right to support what is a measured, legal and broad-based international effort to tackle the evil regime that has contributed to the hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees fleeing for their lives.\"\nAddressing a meeting of the 1922 Conservative backbench committee, Mr Cameron warned that if Tory MPs voted against airstrikes they risked undermining a strong message that the UK was standing alongside its allies, including France and the US - already engaged in military action.\nThe PM's attack on Mr Corbyn - which mirrors comments he first made in his party conference speech in October - was criticised by one Labour MP likely to back airstrikes. Wes Streeting said it was \"not the sort of thing\" he expected to hear from the prime minister.\nWhile in recent days the government has been trying to court Labour MPs, the BBC's Carole Walker said it was now apparent Downing Street was keen to carry the vote through a combination of its own MPs and their \"natural allies\", such as the DUP.\nMr Corbyn has urged Labour frontbenchers who support airstrikes to \"think again\", saying they are \"not a sensible or rational way forward\" and would \"takes us yet again into another conflict\".\nIn an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, he said MPs \"must bear in mind what the public think and what the implications are for this country\".\nMore than 75% of Labour members polled by the party had indicated they were opposed to air strikes, he said.\nAsked about his failure to convince his shadow cabinet to back his position, he said: \"Some people are more difficult to persuade than others, and I look forward to them being persuaded.\"\nRather than air strikes, Mr Corbyn said efforts should focus on a political settlement and achieving a \"credible line of government\" across Syria.\nAsked whether, if he was prime minister, he would urge France and the United States - which are already bombing IS in Syria - to stop, he said: \"I would ask them to put their efforts into a peace process.\"\nHe added: \"I would ask them to join in looking for the way in which we can achieve a political solution to the Syria civil war as the best way forward of solving that problem.\"\nMPs rejected air strikes against Syrian government targets in 2013, but have since backed strikes against IS in Iraq. Ministers say it is \"illogical\" to carry out strikes in Iraq but not Syria as IS does not recognise the border between the countries.\nOne of the key debating points has been Mr Cameron's claim there are 70,000 moderate ground forces able to fight IS in Syria.\nThe prime minister's spokeswoman said a claim by Labour MP Louise Haigh that the national security adviser had briefed MPs that 30,000 of the 70,000 were \"much more radical Islamists\" was a misrepresentation of what he had said.\nMs Haigh made the comment on Twitter, and was challenged by other MPs who had been at the briefing.

It has 45 delegates.\nAP says its count has Mrs Clinton on 1,812 pledged delegates and 571 superdelegates.\nUS media organisations say this means she will now become the first female nominee for a major US political party.\nSuperdelegates are party insiders who can pledge their support for a candidate ahead of the convention but do not formally vote for them until the convention itself.\nIt has taken a long 227 years to get even this far.\nGeorge Washington was elected president of a newly independent America in 1789. Forty-three men later (42 of them white) Hillary Clinton makes history today by being the first female nominee for the White House.\nSo why don't I feel more excited?\nThe lack of exuberance may come from the fact that this has all been going on for so long.\nWe've really been reworking a version of the \"first viable female candidate for the presidency\" story since 20 January 2007, the first time Hillary Clinton declared her candidacy for the White House.\nWe're exhausted. We've run out of superlatives. We've overused every anecdote from the former first lady, former senator, former secretary's well-covered life.\nA woman president would be new, Hillary Clinton is not.\nWhy aren't we more excited about Clinton?\nBBC North America editor Jon Sopel says the AP announcement could actually be a problem for Mrs Clinton, as it may depress turnout in Tuesday's primaries and creates the impression that she has only won because of the superdelegates and not the ordinary voters.\nThe Democratic Party has a far larger number of superdelegates than the Republicans, meaning a candidate would have to win 58.8% of primary and caucus votes cast under the party's proportional system to win by pledged delegates alone. Mrs Clinton has about 55% of the overall vote so far.\nShe did not claim victory after the AP announcement, telling supporters in Long Beach, California, on Monday: \"We are on the brink of a historic and unprecedented moment but we still have work to do.\n\"We have six elections tomorrow and we're going to fight hard for every single vote, especially right here in California.\"\nMrs Clinton received another boost on Tuesday when the influential Democratic politician and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed her for president.\nBernie Sanders is hoping for a victory in California to keep his campaign going to the party convention.\nThe Vermont senator has commanded huge crowds at his rallies, many of them younger voters, pledging action on income inequality, minimum wages and student tuition fees.\nOpinion polls in California have suggested that the race with Mrs Clinton there is close.

He is in no doubt about the usefulness of such tech.\n\"Most working parents drop off their children in day nurseries as early as 8 or 9am, and can't pick them up till 5 or 6pm,\" he says.\n\"And in this time, they have absolutely no way of keeping in touch or staying abreast of their children's welfare all through the day. This is a major, major problem.\"\nWith the Mytoddlr app and website, nurseries input data about the child's routine and behaviour throughout the day - from potty breaks to naps - and parents receive these updates in real time on their phones or computers.\n\"The nursery is happy, parents are happy, it's a win-win for everyone really,\" says Mr Adesuyi.\nBut isn't this an extra administrative burden for nursery staff?\nMr Adesuyi claims not, as it can actually reduce paperwork and provide an easier, faster way of communicating with parents, he says.\n\"There are such great apps out there now for parents... solutions to real problems parents have. It's just nice to see technology change parenting,\" he concludes.\nLaunched in 2015, Mytoddlr is being used by 2,000 parents in Lagos, Nigeria, and is currently being trialled by some nurseries in London.\nHarsh Songra, 19-year-old founder and chief executive of smartphone app My Child, was inspired to launch his child development monitoring app after having dyspraxia when growing up.\nThis developmental disorder affecting co-ordination and movement can be difficult to diagnose if parents don't know what to look out for.\n\"I have known the struggle of a family where the child has a disorder,\" he says. \"It took my parents over nine years to figure out the specific problem, and I still go through some health issues,\" says Mr Songra.\nThe My Child app helps parents monitor the development of a child up to 24 months old, asking questions, aggregating relevant content, and identifying local experts.\nLaunched in early 2015, the app has been downloaded more than 11,000 times in over 140 countries, and is particularly popular in the US, India, Singapore and the UK.\nMr Songra believes technology is a useful parenting tool, but concedes that it may sometimes interfere with the work of professionals.\n\"At times it does affect their relations with doctors, because parents become paranoid about their child because of what they searched on Google,\" he says.\n\"The problem is that we tend to believe the content of one link over 100 others, and then take actions based on that knowledge.\n\"But we believe all this will surely change with time, as there is going to be more awareness about these issues in the future.\"\nParenting apps - from webcam baby monitors to location-tracking services, interactive games to health checkers - are definitely on the rise, as busy parents integrate the latest tech into their lives.\nOne woman in Australia even used Siri, Apple's voice-activated iPhone assistant, to call an ambulance when her toddler daughter stopped breathing.\nBut for New Jersey-based entrepreneur Amit Murumkar, the motivation for creating an app was purely practical.\n\"My daughter was three... and would bring a piece of art back daily from her Montessori school, but there is only so much you can put on a refrigerator door,\" he says.\n\"I also was a good artist as a kid, and when I became a parent I thought, 'If only I could show the art I did to my own kids.'\"\nSo he built a smartphone app called Canvsly, that allows parents to capture these works of art on the app, organise them into albums, and invite grandparents or other family members to see and comment on them.\nThe artwork can also be printed through the app and used to create gifts. As long as you trust the app's cloud storage provider, you could then ditch the originals.\n\"Parents can go guilt-free and clutter-free,\" Mr Murumkar says, adding that the app has been downloaded in more than 100 countries.\nAnesu Charamba, a tech analyst at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, believes such apps are helping parents raise and interact with their children in \"new and exciting ways\".\nAnd as smartphones and cheaper, more reliable internet access spreads beyond developed economies to the rest of the world, early adopters will be joined by the majority, he believes.\nFollow Technology of Business editor @matthew_wall on Twitter\nClick here for more Technology of Business features", "summary": "How can busy working mums and dads keep tabs on their toddlers and stay connected to them during the working day?", "id": "36854290", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe article is about the use of technology in parenting.\nThe article is about the use of technology in parenting.

De Gregorio was sacked following a joke about the governing body on Swiss TV.\nIn light of Sunday's reports his ousting perhaps becomes easier to understand.\nDe Gregorio is thought to have favoured a low-key strategy for Blatter in his final few months in charge.\nBut a PR professional by the name of Klaus Stohlker has the ear of the Fifa president.\nStohlker criticised De Gregorio in an article to a Swiss magazine on 2 June and blamed him for Blatter's poor image.\nThat report ultimately led to De Gregorio's departure when Blatter, after being confronted, refused to disavow the comments.\nFifa insist Stohlker's mandate to advise Blatter ended in May.\nHowever Stohlker made on-record comments to Sky News on Monday outlining how Blatter remains a credible candidate for the new election.\nIs he acting without authority? Or is this a ham-fisted attempt to test the water by Blatter?\nAs a long-time friend Stohlker advised the 79-year-old in the run-up to May's presidential election.\nAnd his influence may be growing - despite Fifa's formal insistence he is not officially connected to Blatter.\nControl of at least some of the message may well have changed hands.\nWith a reform programme to be implemented, an emergency executive committee to be held and an ideologically sound successor to be found, there is a lot still at stake for the man who has led Fifa since 1998.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe has no intention of leaving Fifa with a whimper or exiting the side door, having been humbled.\nBlatter announced he was quitting in the wake of the FBI-led corruption investigation into Fifa and the arrest of several senior football officials.\nWith no sign of a US indictment against him Blatter may also feel emboldened.\nBlatter could also feel indignant - given how many of his supporters feel the US investigations against football officials are an example of neo-imperialism.\nTherefore his new strategy could be to try and ensure he remains as relevant as possible in the remaining time he has left as leader.\nAn example of this is the fact he's said to be keen to do television interviews again, albeit with Fifa's internal media team at first.\nUltimately, Blatter does not want to be a 'lame duck' - especially once the candidates to succeed him begin to campaign.\nThey will start to become prominent from July/August onwards - and it is their ideas and proposals which will dominate the presidential campaign and the headlines.\nIn the end, only Blatter can decide if he will defy his own word and stand again.\nBut what we could be witnessing right now is an attempt to assert control over the narrative concerning Fifa's future.\nThe other aim is to continue to organise a longed-for, dignified and, as strange as it may sound, triumphant exit at the emergency Fifa congress.\nHe may be fighting the dying of the light on his time at Fifa but Blatter still wants to be the one who ultimately decides when, and how, to extinguish the flame.", "summary": "During the Cold War, analysts in the West had to decipher the politics of the Soviet Union using any small scrap of information they could find.", "id": "33141267", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe order by which members of the ruling politburo were positioned at public appearances, the arrangement of articles in the state newspaper or the removal of portraits were poured over to extract an understanding of what was truly going on behind", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nBlatter is considering staying on as Fifa president despite his promise to quit\nHe is being advised by a PR professional who has been critical of the Fifa communications chief\nBlatter is trying to assert control over the narrative", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

It's been played in the proper way, very competitive but also respectful, and that has allowed England to flourish.\nThat is down to the players. It's not easy to suddenly change your game, but England have managed it - the challenge now for Eoin Morgan's men is to continue to play with the same spirit of adventure.\nFor the first time in a long time, there are suddenly good vibes around the one-day team. Young players like Alex Hales and Adil Rashid have come into the team and given the side a real lift.\nLet's not kid ourselves: New Zealand's bowling attack in this series was inexperienced, they weren't the same side that performed so well in the World Cup, but for me the result is almost beside the point. It's the transformation in England's whole approach that gives me optimism for the future.\nJoe Root and Jos Buttler both batted absolutely magnificently in this series. Root has become such a consistent performer for England in all formats, while Buttler is a composed cricketer who has a knack of always making the right decisions.\nFor me though, two players who aren't part of England's Test side have really stood out: captain Eoin Morgan and spinner Adil Rashid.\nMorgan is batting better than ever. He had a poor World Cup where he looked horribly out of form, and many people thought that might even be the end. But he's come back and played brilliantly: he's such a clever batsman and when he plays with real audacity he has the ability to score runs all around the wicket.\nA lot of credit has to go to England's cricket director Andrew Strauss: he gave Morgan a vote of confidence as ODI captain and that has given him a real boost.\nRashid came into this series with a lot of question marks hanging over him, but he has done enough to show he can bowl well under pressure.\nHe didn't have it easy in a series dominated by aggressive batting but I liked the way he was unafraid to toss the ball up and give it some air. He's a very capable lower-order batsman too, equally adept at deft shots and power hitting.\nIt's a terrible shame that England didn't bowl him on spin-friendly pitches in their recent Test series against the West Indies. People will talk about Rashid possibly coming in to the Test side for the Ashes but I can't see that happening: I think there will be a reluctance to play him as the sole spinner.\nEngland's fielding has to improve. Their ground-fielding was OK, but the catching was generally below par, they dropped far too many chances.\nLike New Zealand, England suffered from some very expensive bowling in the death overs at the end of the innings. A lot of that was down to good batting but I'd like to see more determination to bowl yorkers.\nBatting-wise, the positive intent is great but it's got to be done sensibly. There's a fine line between being aggressive and being reckless.\nThat is the big question. A lot will depend on how the key men who haven't played in this ODI series - the likes of Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Alastair Cook - return to camp.\nI think they will have a feel for what's happened here, and be very energised by how England have played.\nIt's important that Paul Farbrace continues to have an influence. He will be replaced as head coach by Trevor Bayliss for the Ashes, but he has done a brilliant job in his interim reign.\nHe has worked well with Bayliss in the past when they were in charge of Sri Lanka together, and I'm sure Bayliss will want to pick Farbrace's brains about how he has overseen this remarkable transformation.\nThe first match in Cardiff is very important. England can't afford lose that first Test. They will have to play at the top of their game to beat Australia, but I don't think anyone would write them off.\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's James Gheerbrant.", "summary": "England's one-day cricket has undergone an utterly remarkable transformation in the space of just five matches.", "id": "33212990", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"England have beaten New Zealand at their own game: they have played in an attacking, enterprising way, abandoning the caution that characterised the ill-fated Peter Moores era and giving their young players free rein", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"England have beaten New Zealand at their own game: they have played in an attacking, enterprising way, abandoning the caution that characterised the ill-fated Peter Moores era and giving their young players free rein", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\"England have beaten New Zealand at their own game: they have played in an attacking, enterprising way, abandoning the caution that characterised the ill-fated Peter Moores era and giving their young players free rein", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"England have beaten New Zealand at their own game: they have played in an attacking, enterprising way, abandoning the caution that characterised the ill-fated Peter Moores era and giving their young players free rein", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\"England have beaten New Zealand at their own game: they have played in an attacking, enterprising way, abandoning the caution that characterised the ill-fated Peter Moores era and giving their young players free rein", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nEngland's World Cup campaign was a disaster.

The successes have been down to partnership work and this is continuing with the South of Scotland Golden Eagle project, which aims to boost populations even further.\n\"But it is clear from this national survey that there are still areas of Scotland, which are ideal habitats for golden eagles to breed and hunt, where there has not been a recovery in population despite a lot of hard work to protect these birds. This seems like a missed opportunity.\"\nAndrew Bachell, SNH's director of policy and advice, said: \"It's wonderful to see golden eagles reaching favourable conservation status nationally. These beautiful birds are such an important part of Scotland's nature, a species which people love to see when they visit our wilder landscapes.\n\"It's particularly encouraging to see greater recovery in some areas where persecution had been thought to be a major constraint in the past. That picture is uneven though, and we would still expect eagles to be doing better in parts of the eastern Highlands.\"\nTim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group at Scottish Land and Estates, said the increase in the golden eagle population was \"in large part\" a tribute to members of the group and the way they managed the land.\n\"They have helped the surveyors and worked with Scottish Natural Heritage in the interest of golden eagles for many years,\" he said.\n\"The east Highlands still have the highest level of productivity (young per pair) and a stable number of occupied territories over more than three decades.\n\"The south central Highlands, which includes significant areas of driven grouse moor has shown by far the greatest increase in range occupancy - 70% - since 2003.\"", "summary": "Numbers of golden eagles in Scotland are close to \"historic\" levels, with more than 500 pairs, a survey of the birds has found.", "id": "37924951", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1.

Seventy per cent of our land is farmed - beautiful landscape has not happened by accident but has been actively managed.\n\u201cAgriculture is an industry more susceptible to outside shocks and unpredictable events - whether it\u2019s the weather or disease.

Once this rat pressed the correct lever, its brain activity was delivered as electrical stimulation into the brain of the second rat - designated the \"decoder\".\nThe decoder rat had the same types of levers in its chamber, but it did not receive any visual cue indicating which lever it should press to obtain a reward.\nIn order to receive the reward, the decoder rat would have to rely on the cue transmitted from the encoder via the brain-to-brain interface.\nThe team members then conducted trials to determine how well the decoder animal could decipher the brain input from the encoder rat to choose the correct lever. The decoder rat ultimately achieved a maximum success rate of about 70%.\nAlthough the information was transmitted in real time, the learning process was not instantaneous.\n\"[It] takes about 45 days of training an hour a day,\" said Prof Nicolelis.\n\"There is a moment in time when... it clicks. Suddenly the [decoder] animal realises: 'Oops! The solution is in my head. It's coming to me' and he gets it right.\"\nThere was also a feedback system, denying the encoder rat an extra reward if the decoder rat did not press the correct lever.\nThe encoder rat's brain signals then became clearer, giving the decoder a greater chance of interpreting the message correctly, Prof Nicolelis noted.\nHe explained: \"Basically [the second rat] is working as... a biological computer.\"\nOne replication of the experiment successfully linked a rat at Duke with one at the University of Natal in Brazil. Nicolelis foresees eventually extending the system to larger numbers of animals. \"We are already building the setup... You could actually have millions of brains tackling the same problem and sharing a solution.\"\nAnd he also thinks the idea could be extended to humans.\n\"We will have a way to exchange information across millions of people without using keyboards or voice recognition devices or the type of interfaces that we normally use today,\" he said.\n\"I truly believe that in a few decades\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we will know what it is to communicate in that way.\"\nBut Prof Nicolelis is clear that this depends on the development of non-invasive techniques to share information between human brains.\nProf Christopher James, an expert in neural engineering at the University of Warwick, who uses non-invasive techniques in his own research, explains that it is currently not possible to put information into a brain using just the surface of the scalp.\n\"If you want to get information into the brain, then putting electrodes right at the brain sites is the way to do it. However, it's clearly very invasive,\" said Prof James.\nHe added that the invasive nature of the research raised ethical questions: \"It's very, very interesting isn't it? Because in humans you'd obviously get informed consent in doing this.\"\nProf James explained: \"It's an exciting paper which basically shows that it is possible to take information out of the brain, and it is possible to take information and pump it into the brain.\n\"What this shows is that the technology is here. And the sort of things we should be talking about is: Why are we doing this, and what do we hope to get out of it?\"\nThe BBC World Service programme Science in Action will be broadcast at 1932 GMT on 28 February; a schedule of repeat broadcasts can be found here.

What could betray its purpose are the paintings on its sides showing people visiting a health facility.\nWhen it rolls into a town, village or sets up on an island, it plugs itself into the local community to get the word out about its services.\nOut of the truck come tents, tables and medical equipment - it is essentially a moving clinic.\nOn this particular day the team had set up at a health centre in Nakifuma village, about 40km north of the Ugandan capital Kampala.\nThe first person to be circumcised was 18-year-old Frank Kiyaga.\nHe was always scared of the procedure. In fact he ran away when his mother tried to get him to do it.\nBut the truck had been in the neighbourhood for several weeks and his friends convinced him it was safe.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexual men getting HIV by approximately 60%.\nBut for many in Uganda, getting it done is not easy, mainly because there are not enough safe facilities and it can be expensive.\nMr Kiyaga told us: \"I walk to this place and it's free of charge. Yet the other place you could get circumcised from is 2km away and you have to pay for the operation.\n\"The other [free] option is Kayunga, which is 30km away.\"\nThe whole point behind the truck is to offer this potentially lifesaving operation to whoever needs it.\nBecause of the resources available, their work has focused on areas in central Uganda and some islands in Lake Victoria.\nThe organisation behind the innovation is the Makerere University Walter Reed Project, a collaboration between scientists in Kampala and the US military HIV research programme.\nFred Magala, who heads up the team operating the truck, says: \"You can't move a physical building.\n\"Given limited resources we thought we'd come up with an innovation to ensure that Ugandans access safe male circumcision even when they are living very distant from the healthcare facility\"\nThe process of getting circumcised starts with education and testing in the tents set up around the truck.\nThose under 18 have to get parental consent. Patients are taught about the procedure and its benefits but it is always stressed that it is not guaranteed protection against HIV and that safe sex still needs to be practised.\nOnce they have undergone tests for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and been given the all clear, they then climb up the stairs into the vehicle.\nInside is a small but well-equipped medical theatre. It has a couple of beds separated by curtains so two patients can be circumcised at a time.\nPatients entering are given theatre clothing and a change of shoes, the normal practice in many parts of the world. There are heart-rate monitors and oxygen tanks, and every patient is treated with a disposable kit.\nBack in 2010, the Ugandan government set itself a target of getting 4.2 million men and boys circumcised by the end of this year.\nBut it seems unlikely that that will be reached. A report by the state-run Uganda Aids Commission found that, by the end of 2013, 1.4 million had undergone the procedure.\nIt attributed the slow uptake to misinformation. For example, some tribes that traditionally carry out circumcision saw the clinical approach as weak because of the use of a local anaesthetic; some men were scared about the pain and how long it would take for them to heal; and some women thought it would lessen their partner's sexual performance.\nThe report also found that the operation was not easily accessible for many men, as was the case with Mr Kiyaga. And this is where the truck offers to play a role.\nWe caught up with him after his operation. A local anaesthetic had been used so he was not in pain and was able to wear his tight jeans.\nHe had not told his family he was going ahead with the procedure. We walked home with him to find out their reaction to the news. He lives just 200m from where the truck was parked.\nHis aunt and cousins were at home. She was very pleased. She said: \"It's a good thing because Frank was the only one who hadn't been circumcised out of my boys at home.\n\"Some people didn't have the opportunity or luck to get their children circumcised but this has helped them and myself to have children circumcised.\"\nSome are already looking at the mobile circumcision truck as an innovation that could be extended to help people get access to a range of healthcare.\nHaving a well-equipped, clean and efficient operating theatre on wheels that can get to many parts of the country could help accident victims, mothers having difficulty giving birth, and those who cannot get to a hospital.\nMed in Africa is a brand new eight-part series showcasing health innovations across Africa and what these might mean for the future of healthcare on the continent and beyond.", "summary": "Uganda's mobile circumcision truck has one clear goal: to get as many men and boys as possible circumcised safely.", "id": "32121923", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe truck is a mobile clinic that offers circumcision services to men in Uganda.\nThe truck is a mobile clinic that offers circumcision services to men in Uganda.

He showed me the data for one player and commented that it was clear he was being too aggressive on par fives - this explained the dent in an otherwise impressive web.\nClarke expects the app will prove invaluable with his wildcard picks and in putting together foursomes and fourball pairings during the match itself.\nLast week the captain had two sit down meals with all of the likely candidates who were on show at the Players Championship at Sawgrass and he must be relieved Jason Day is not a US player.\nThe data surrounding the Australian could not be more impressive as he stretched his lead at the top of the world rankings with his seventh win since finishing fourth at last year's Open.\nDay's ruthless Players victory robbed the tournament of its usual final day drama but left no one in any doubt over the identity of the best player in the world at the moment.\nHow Rory McIlroy would love to regain Day's winning touch.  There are still too many unforced errors creeping onto the Ulsterman's scorecard.\nMcIlroy is the only member of the world's top five not to have won this year, despite five top six finishes. There is nothing wrong with his ball striking but he acknowledges that he is making too many mental errors.\n\"It's just knowing when to play the right shot at the right time,\" he commented after finishing tied for 12th at Sawgrass.\nMcIlroy's charitable foundation hosts this week's Irish Open at the K Club and he will be desperate to make up for last year's missed cut in the same event.\n\"The last golf tournament I won was in Dubai in November, so it feels like a long time ago now,\" he acknowledged.\n\"But again, I need to stay patient because if I keep pushing and keep looking for the win, that's when these sloppy mistakes start to creep in.\n\"I just need to go out there and play my game and trust that I'm playing well enough for the chips to fall my way sooner rather than later.\"\nAs an individual McIlroy doesn't need a statistical app or a football manager to tell him where he is going wrong.

That will not help Scotland be the best again.\"\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon focused on the same issue when she visited communities near the Dalzell Steelwork in Motherwell, days after a deal was reached to save it and another mothballed steel plant in Clydebridge, South Lanarkshire.\nMs Sturgeon had already promised her party would up the number of apprenticeship training places from 25,000 a year to 30,000 a year by 2020 if it is re-elected on 5 May.\nNow, the SNP has vowed those additional 5,000 places will be in \"high-level science, technology and engineering courses that deliver the skills employers need and the high-wage jobs our young people deserve\".\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Giving our young people the skills they need to be at the cutting edge of our economy and our jobs market is vital for their future and for the future of our economy.\n\"That means learning from our traditional industries, expanding support for science, maths, engineering and vocational training, building greater connections between industry, schools and colleges, and ensuring our young people are able to see the huge opportunities ahead of them.\"\nMeanwhile, Scottish Labour said cuts to council services would have a negative impact on older people and make delivering proper social care in Scotland even more difficult.\nThe party said it would make \"fairer choices\" on tax to stop cuts to local services, and would spend the health budget more effectively, with an additional ??300m for social care to guarantee a care package within a week of assessment.\nLabour's Jackie Baillie said: \"We need to end the sticking plaster approach to our NHS which sees queues at our A&E wards and only a third of our NHS staff believing there are enough of them to do their jobs properly.\n\"Labour would relieve the pressures on our hospitals by protecting the health budget and spending it better. That would help our health service, established in the 1940s, to meet the challenges of the 2040s. More than 270 Scots died in the last year waiting for a care package.

Protocol dictates that the party that wins the most votes has the right to try to form a government. But the key word there is \"try\".\nOn paper at least the PP will struggle, because during the election campaign so many parties ruled out going into government with it.\nIt is the PP's worst election result since 1989. Its share of the vote fell from 45% in 2011 to 29% this time.\nEven if you add the PP's seats to those won by the new liberal party Ciudadanos (Citizens), with which it has some common ground - mainly on the economy - such an alliance would still be 13 seats short of 176 - the majority needed to govern.\nA key player in the process will be Spain's King Felipe, who has only been on the throne for 18 months following the abdication of his father.\nThe king will oversee the process and ask a party leader, probably incumbent Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, to attempt to form another government.\nBut if Mr Rajoy cannot get enough other parties to join him, then in theory the king should turn to another leader, probably the Socialists' Pedro Sanchez.\nHis PSOE came second with 22% - that is, 90 seats in parliament.\nIt was the PSOE's worst result since Spain's transition to democracy at the end of the 1970s.\nCompromise and co-operation, so fundamental in that transition, but generally absent from political discourse since, will have to become the new watchwords of Spanish politics.\nThe PSOE could team up with the anti-austerity party Podemos (\"We can\") which, standing at its first-ever general election, came an impressive third, fractionally behind the Socialists with 21%.\nBut Spain's electoral system favours the traditional parties, so Podemos's 21% translates into 69 seats.\nEven if Podemos is open to a deal with the PSOE, and Spain's former Communist party (United Left), then this coalition of the left would need either the support of Ciudadanos or of a Basque nationalist party and Catalan pro-independence parties to reach a majority.\nThe latter would possibly demand a referendum in Catalonia on independence from Spain, as part of a deal. Podemos promised that in its election manifesto, but the PSOE remains opposed.\nIn either scenario - a PP-led government, or PSOE-led - long, complicated negotiations will be necessary.\nThe new parties would surely demand radical changes in the way Spain is governed and in economic policy, before risking being a junior partner in any government.\nSpanish politics set for new era\nSpain's new faces in election campaign\nSpanish PM's rival picks corruption fight\nTaking back Barcelona's apartments\nPodemos won by a distance in Catalonia, won the most votes in the Basque Country and came second in Madrid.\nThe party was formed from the \"occupy\" protest of the so-called Indignados (\"indignant ones\") at the end of 2011. The grassroots movement, known in Spain as 15-M, involved people camping out for weeks in Madrid's main square in protest against the economic crisis.\nIt tapped into the widespread dissatisfaction among a large, mainly young chunk of Spain that is fed up with the traditional way of doing politics, and the corruption scandals which have tarnished the old parties.\nPodemos consolidated its success at regional elections in May this year, when its allies took control in Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and Cadiz.\nPodemos's success is also a message to EU leaders: that many Spaniards want the politics of austerity to change.\nThe fact that so many Spaniards are worse off now than they were four years ago was a big factor in the way many cast their vote.\nIronically the relatively new liberal party Ciudadanos, which sells itself as a \"centrist\" force, could play a key role in negotiations - even though it fell short of expectations in this election. It won 40 seats.\nHowever, the clock is ticking. Spain has two months to form a new government.\nIf no leader can put together the necessary number of deputies in parliament then Spain could face fresh elections.\nThat is a realistic possibility.\nSpanish politics used to be predictable. For outsiders the dominance of the PP and PSOE made things almost boring.\nOvernight the landscape has shifted and things are infinitely more unpredictable, because a lot of Spaniards voted for new parties and for change.\nSince its transition to democracy Spain has always had deep divisions under the surface.

Every softly-spoken word is measured, well-considered and laser-like to-the-point.\nI met him this summer for a recording of CEO Secrets, our entrepreneurship series.\nInterestingly, the Skyscanner team is very keen to play down the label of being a \"unicorn company\", a young company valued at more than $1bn, even though that's an elite club that you'd think would be nice to join.\nForget that, they told me. They were more keen to talk about their actual revenues from customers, their rate of growth and their next generation work with automated bots.\nPerhaps that's what sealed the deal with Ctrip.\n\"Ctrip and Skyscanner share a common view - that organising travel has a long way to go to being solved. To do so requires powerful technology and a traveller-first approach,\" Mr Williams said.\nThe sale comes about a year after Skyscanner announced a fresh round of investment to help it expand. Its backers include investment firm Sequoia as well as the Malaysian government's strategic investment fund, Yahoo Japan and fund manager Artemis.\nIts biggest investor, Scottish Equity Partners, welcomed the sale and said it was \"particularly pleased\" that Skyscanner would continue to be headquartered in Edinburgh and to operate independently.\nShanghai-based Ctrip became China's biggest internet travel service after merging with a similar business, Qunar, last year. That deal gave Chinese internet giant Baidu, which controlled Qunar, a 25% stake in Ctrip.\nTwo days after Theresa May promised the CBI a more interventionist industrial policy, one which might stop important British companies being sold to foreign rivals, along comes a deal to expose the shortcomings of such a promise.\nSkyscanner, the Edinburgh-based technology company, has been sold to a Chinese rival for \u00a31.4bn. Skyscanner sells travel online, but it is much more than just another travel website; its technology frequently sees it cited as one of Britain's top technology companies, and it is one of the UK's few \"unicorns\" - youngish tech companies with valuations north of $1bn.\nWhen pundits try and come up with candidates to be the \"British Google\", Skyscanner is a name that frequently comes up.\nIt is hard to see, however, what Theresa May could have done - even once her new industrial policy is in place - to stop the sale.\nLike most British tech companies, Skyscanner has a small army of investors, ranging from traditional private-equity investors to technology specialists like Sequoia Capital.\nIt would be hard to argue that there is some national interest in interfering to keep it in British hands, and to do so would interfere with the basic rights of investors to sell their property.", "summary": "Skyscanner, the UK-based travel search business, has been bought by Ctrip,

in many cases elsewhere - while estate agents have lists of \"hundreds\" of professionals waiting to move into the area instead.\nCardiff council has also limited the number of houses of multiple occupancy (HMO) in the Cathays and Plasnewydd wards to tackle problems like anti-social behaviour associated with students.\nAnother reason for a shift in the type of people living there is a lack of houses for sale near the city centre, with those available too expensive for many families to buy, according to estate agent Ross Hooper-Nash.\n\"The only way to live close to the city centre is to rent,\" he said.\nAs a result, his Jeffrey Ross firm has a waiting list that \"runs into the hundreds\" of people wanting to rent in Roath and Cathays, describing the market as \"very competitive and buoyant\".\nCurrently, Mr Hooper-Nash said a three-bedroom house can bring in \u00a3400 per room per month, with two-bed properties more.\nPrices will continue to rise, he believes, not just because of demand from professionals, but because of foreign students willing to pay more for quality accommodation.\nUnless more is built near the city centre, Mr Hooper-Nash sees other areas such as Grangetown, which have not been as popular in the past, becoming more desirable.\nDespite this competition for properties in Cathays and Roath, there is still enough to meet student demand, according to Cardiff University's students' union.\n\"What is more likely to be the issue is the availability of quality housing for students to rent,\" said vice president for welfare, Hollie Cooke.\n\"Changes in renting behaviour seem to suggest that students are more aware of their rights now, which results in them looking for higher-quality accommodation.\"\nA glut of modern developments are in the pipeline - including a 42-storey tower and another featuring dinner party rooms, a cinema and sky lounge in the city centre.\nShe also believes new requirements from the Rent Smart scheme, which was set up to tackle bad landlords, is fuelling a desire for better standards.\nHMO licenses -  issued by law to ensure owners are competent and qualified to manage properties - are also believed to be having an effect.\nTo gain one in the Cathays and Plasnewydd ward, Cardiff council now has additional requirements for landlords that it says are to tackle issues such as waste and anti-social behaviour related to students.\nAnother problem this move is aimed at remedying is a finding from a 2005 survey that  8.9% of private houses in Cathays were \"unfit\".\nCardiff council's student liaison officer Emma Robson said the new HMO regulations should ensure there are not too many in one part of the city.\nBut financial advisor Jamie Allan said they will make it \"very difficult\" to convert existing residential properties in Cathays and Roath into student houses.\nMore significantly, he believes an extra 3% stamp duty on houses bought to rent should stop many investors entering the market.\nJack Mitchell of estate agent Taylors Countrywide believes the long-term intention is to reduce the number of students in Cathays and Roath.\n\"Landlords will need to apply and pay for these (HMO) licences, with less and less guarantee they will be approved,\" he said.\n\"Plus all the added improvements that come with HMO licensing (such as fire regulations, kitchen and bathroom standards).\n\"This should lead to less new student properties becoming available for rent in the next few years and will also have an effect on sales process for properties with a HMO licence already in place.\"\nHis company has a waiting list of about 80 people keen to rent in the area, with Mr Mitchell citing reasons such as proximity to the city centre and school catchment areas for the popularity.\nIn Roath, a two-bed house can bring in \u00a3900 per month and \u00a31,200 for a three-bed, with Cathays able to command \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000.\nDespite student houses bringing in more money, he added: \"Professionals will always be more attractive to landlords simply due to reputation and wear and tear with the property.\"\nAnd the non-student demand will keep growing, he believes, because, unlike in Bristol and London, living near to Cardiff city centre is still affordable for most.", "summary": "Damp patches, peeling wallpaper, draughty windows and dishes which never got washed may have been features of many people's student digs.", "id": "38340391", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area of Cardiff. 2. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "1. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area of Cardiff. 2. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "1. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area of Cardiff. 2. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area of Cardiff. 2. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "1. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area of Cardiff. 2. \tThe article is about the changing demographics of the Cathays and Roath area", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nThe city of Cardiff is the capital of Wales and the country's largest city.\nCardiff is the capital of Wales and the country's largest city.\nCardiff is the capital of Wales and the country's largest city", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_2": "\n\"The student market is still very strong in Cardiff, but the demand for professionals is growing.\n\"The city centre is still very affordable for professionals, and the city is still a very attractive place to live.\n", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_2": "\nThe article is about the housing market in Cardiff, Wales.\nThe article is about the housing market in Cardiff, Wales.

Similar claims were also made against Moody, who had been dismissed by the club for an alleged \u00a315m transfer overspend, which he denied.\nMoody left his post as Crystal Palace sporting director shortly after the allegations were made.\nMackay admitted sending offensive messages and apologised, adding he was not racist, sexist, homophobic or anti-Semitic.\nHe was appointed Wigan Athletic manager in November 2014, despite the club being urged to reconsider by campaigners who cited the FA investigation into the text messages.\nMackay was sacked by Wigan in April following a string of poor results. Just a month earlier, Cardiff said they had submitted more evidence to the FA related to the text inquiry.\nThe FA's ruling comes after Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston was given a six-week ban from all football activity and fined \u00a340,000 for a text-message exchange with a fan.\nOyston, though, admitted a misconduct charge after referring to a supporter as \"a retard\".\nThe FA said it was \"determined to eliminate discriminatory conduct in all its forms\" and will now look to introduce a policy governing behaviour in private.\nIt added: \"The FA is in the process of carrying out a complex review involving all stakeholders on how communications, and in particular those involving discriminatory language, which may be viewed as taking place in private should be treated in the future.\"\nKick It Out said the FA's promise to review its policy was \"lamentably late in the day\".\nThe organisation added in a statement: \"The FA has damaged its own credibility and anti-discrimination policies by taking the decision not to charge Malky Mackay and Iain Moody.\n\"The FA needed to take a strong position to help prove football's 'zero-tolerance' approach towards discriminatory practices. Instead, we have another example of the status quo being reinforced, and discriminatory practices being allowed to flourish in 'no-go' areas such as within the exclusivity of boardrooms, training grounds and dressing rooms, and via private communication networks.\n\"How can anybody truly challenge discrimination and prejudiced attitudes in football with confidence now? The apparent reluctance to punish comments and behaviour considered as 'banter' or 'light-hearted culture' within these settings is entirely damaging.\"\nSimon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said the decision \"seems at odds\" with FA action over former Wigan chairman Dave Whelan's racist comments - made in defence Mackay's appointment as Wigan manager - and Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli who posted an offensive picture on Instagram.\nA Women in Football (Wif) statement also called for the FA to \"bring it policies into line with other sectors\".

One of those held, Amanda Berry, 27, escaped on Monday and raised the alarm.\nThe other women freed soon afterwards were Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32.\nMr Castro, handcuffed and dressed in blue overalls, remained silent and looked down while lawyers spoke to the judge at Cleveland Municipal Court on Thursday.\nCounty prosecutor Brian Murphy told the court: \"The charges against Mr Castro are based on premeditated, deliberate, depraved decisions to snatch three young ladies from Cleveland West Side streets to be used in whatever self-gratifying, self-serving way he saw fit.\"\nHe is charged with four counts of kidnapping, covering the three initial abduction victims and Jocelyn, Ms Berry's six-year-old daughter, who was apparently conceived and born in captivity.\nThe former school bus driver also faces three counts of rape, one against each woman. More charges may be added, officials have said.\nTwo of Mr Castro's brothers, Pedro and Onil, were also arrested, but police found no evidence they were involved in the crime.\nThey appeared in court alongside Ariel Castro on unrelated minor charges. Pedro Castro was fined $100 for public drinking, while two charges against Onil Castro were dropped.\nProsecutor Tim McGinty said on Thursday he would to seek aggravated murder charges against Mr Castro, and could even seek the death penalty against the former school bus driver.\nHe told a news conference that murder charges would be based on evidence from one of the women held captive in Mr Castro's house that he had impregnated her, then physically abused and starved her in order to induce miscarriages.\nBy Paul AdamsBBC News\nAriel Castro came into the Cleveland courtroom with his head down, as if trying to bury his face in the collar of his blue prison jumpsuit.\nThe small, wood-panelled courtroom was crowded and hot as a phalanx of cameras focused on the man accused of a litany of horrors. Ariel Castro never looked up as the prosecutor described the terrible crimes he is accused of.\nThree days ago, he casually went to mow his mother's lawn before drinking with his brother. Now, long before his trial, lurid accounts of the crimes he's accused of perpetrating on his three victims have flashed across the world. His home is a house of horrors and he, as the cover of a Cleveland magazine puts it, is already a \"monster\".\n\"This child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of our city,\" Mr McGinity said.\nAriel Castro has been put on suicide watch and will be kept in isolation, his court-appointed lawyer Kathleen DeMetz told reporters.\nThe three women were all abducted after accepting rides from Mr Castro, according to a police report leaked to the media.\nOn Thursday, Mr Castro's daughter, Arlene, who was one of the last people to see Gina DeJesus before she disappeared in 2004 aged 14, wept during a TV interview.\nDescribing herself as \"disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated\", she apologised to Ms DeJesus.\nThe women told officials they could only remember being outside twice during their time in captivity.\nCleveland City Councilman Brian Cummins said the women had told police they had only gone as far as a garage on the property, disguised in wigs and hats.\nMr Cummins, citing police information, said the victims had been kept apart inside the house until their captor felt he had enough control to allow them to mingle.\nA source told the BBC that one of the women was forced to help Ms Berry deliver her daughter, and was threatened with death if the child did not survive.\nHer baby was born in a plastic inflatable children's swimming pool on Christmas day 2006, according to a police report.\nPolice said more than 200 pieces of evidence had been taken from the home where the three women were held captive.\nThey said interviews with the women had yielded enough information to charge Mr Castro.\nPolice said he had been co-operating with them, waiving his right to silence and agreeing to a test to establish Jocelyn's paternity.\nOn Wednesday hundreds of cheering people welcomed home Ms DeJesus and Ms Berry and her daughter.\nMs Berry, whose disappearance in 2003 the day before her 17th birthday was widely publicised in the local media, escaped on Monday evening by kicking the door and screaming for help, while her alleged captor was out.\nMs Knight, who was 20 when she disappeared in 2002, remains in hospital.\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer reports she had complained of chest pains during her rescue, but she is listed as in good condition.", "summary": "The man accused of imprisoning three women for about a decade in the US city of Cleveland has made his first court appearance.", "id": "22461506", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nAriel Castro, 52, is charged with kidnap and rape.

\u00c2\u00a3510) a month.\nAbout 90% of the students are Muslim but the founders stress it is open to all races and denominations.\nBut TLC does not just offer the opportunity to excel in the classroom.\nThe school serves as an oasis of tranquillity as it provides a safe space for the pupils who have free access there to psychologists and occupational therapists - something these children would never otherwise have access to.\nThe health professionals play a key role in helping the learners overcome their often traumatic circumstances which include witnessing murders, armed robberies, abusive relationships or simply a lack of affection at home.\nAshra Norton, TLC director:\n\"What I am particularly pleased about is that learners are now thinking about doing courses in areas like actuarial science, health, physical sciences and engineering.\"\nHowever, one of the main reasons behind the success of TLC is the strict discipline coupled with the hard work put in by both pupils and teachers.\nThe school's navy and light blue uniform, which is given free of charge to each of the pupils, plays an important part in creating an identity and sense of togetherness in a community where gangs have filled that vacuum for many youngsters.\nMeanwhile, the school organizes extra lessons in maths and science, as well as in any other subjects that pupils find problematic, over weekends and sometimes during the week for those in their final year.\n\"Although I'm very happy, I'll feel even better if all the other schools in Manenberg could get similar results,\" says TLC director Ashra Norton, who grew up in the area.\nThe school is doing its part here as well, however: TLC hosts joint tuition programmes with other schools in the area in an effort to help pupils keep up with their work.\nThe 2 Oceans Education Foundation is involved with six other schools in Cape Town, most of them in the poorer townships.\nIts most recent involvement is with Langa High School, located in Cape Town's oldest black township, which had a Matric pass rate of just 34% last year.\n\"There is no quick fix solution,\" Mrs Norton says. \"It requires hard work and determination to survive against extraordinary odds. We have a very strong intervention programme in the school starting from their first year in grade eight.\"\nThe programme includes providing daily sandwiches or meals that are sometimes provided by sponsors to nearly half of the 625 pupils who come from economically deprived homes.\nThe school has managed to raise the bar for pupils who are now aiming much higher than their parents could ever have dreamed of.\n\"What I am particularly pleased about is that learners are now thinking about doing courses in areas like actuarial science, health and physical sciences and engineering which was unheard of a few years ago,\" says Mrs Norton.", "summary": "Manenberg in Cape Town, South Africa, is infamous for its high crime rate, but it is now being associated with academic excellence, writes the BBC's Mo Allie.", "id": "39107310", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe school is doing its part here as well, however: TLC hosts joint tuition programmes with other schools in the area in an effort to help pupils keep up with their work.

He says the situation is \"so serious\" that \"immediate and drastic action\" is needed.\nYet it took the publication of the Wada report, based on the evidence of a 2014 German TV documentary, for the IAAF to rule that \"the whole system has failed the athletes, not just in Russia, but around the world\".\nIAAF chairman Lord Coe said at the time: \"This has been a shameful wake-up call.\"\nIAAF spokesman Chris Turner told AP: \"No cases were concealed or suppressed. The IAAF simply tackled them in order of importance.\"\nHe said every athlete was investigated and the IAAF has successfully brought 33 blood passport cases against Russian athletes, with \"more pending\".\n\"In 2011, there was a huge influx of suspicious profiles coming through,\" Turner said in a statement.\n\"There was a need to prioritise, and in particular to expedite those cases which involved potential medal winners ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games.\"\nHe described Weiss' letter as a \"clear, open warning\" to Russia and insisted the IAAF had been \"very strong\".\nIAAF deputy general secretary Nick Davies has stepped aside while an investigation takes place over a separate plan to delay naming Russian drug cheats, before the 2013 World Championships in Moscow.\nIn an email sent 22 days before the competition to former IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack, Davies wrote about the need to discuss \"Russian skeletons in the cupboard\" with the anti-doping team.\nThe Englishman told Diack \"we need to be smart\" about releasing names.\nDavies has denied any wrongdoing. The proposals contained in the email were never carried through.\nAfter Russia's competition ban for alleged \"state-sponsored doping\", Lamine Diack, the former IAAF president, was placed under criminal investigation over allegations he took payments for deferring sanctions against Russian drugs cheats. He denies wrongdoing.\nThree athletics figures - Diack's son Papa Massata Diack, Balakhnichev and fellow Russian official Alexei Melnikov - were given lifetime bans after a report claimed they \"conspired\" to blackmail a Russian athlete in order to cover up her doping violations.\nLamine Diack's successor and former vice-president Lord Coe has pledged to double the anti-doping budget, establish a separate integrity unit for athletics before Rio 2016, and double the international testing pool of athletes to 1,000.\nOn Monday, UK Athletics chief Ed Warner suggested that world records should be reset as part of a 14-point manifesto to start a new \"clean era\" for the sport.", "summary": "World athletics' governing body feared Russian doping was so out of control that athletes could have died - six years before the country was banned from international competition.", "id": "35298526", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe IAAF has been accused of covering up doping in Russia\nThe IAAF has been accused of covering up doping in Russia.\nThe IAAF has been accused of covering up doping in Russia.

But he repeated China and Russia's joint call for the US to reverse plans to deploy an anti-missile system in South Korea, and for the two countries to suspend their joint military exercises close to North Korea.\nBoth Russia and China are permanent members of the UN Security Council and could veto any new resolution.\nEarlier, Donald Trump criticised China for its trade with North Korea.\nMs Haley, who said she had discussed the issue with the president, said the US could cut off trade with countries which continued to trade with North Korea in violation of US resolutions.\n\"We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime,\" she says.\nMr Trump has arrived in Warsaw, ahead of his trip to Hamburg for the G20 summit of major economies, where he is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for the second time.\nThe US president held talks with China's leader Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida in April.\nAfter those talks, Mr Trump hailed \"tremendous progress\" with China, but on Wednesday the US president tweeted: \"So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!\"\nNorth Korea's test of a long-range missile, which some experts think could travel far enough to hit Alaska, will be the subject of talks between leaders at the G20, which includes Russia.\nBarbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent\nThere's little doubt the honeymoon between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is over.\nThe administration is frustrated that China isn't doing more to put the squeeze on North Korea. Beijing is angry about recent moves taken by the White House, including sanctions on a Chinese bank for doing \"illicit\" business with Pyongyang, and a $1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan.\nIn one way this tension is neither new nor surprising - previous American presidents encountered similar resistance from Beijing, which is determined to prevent chaotic upheaval in North Korea. But the stakes are higher because Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme is becoming more of a threat.\nMr Trump might respond by imposing more sanctions on Chinese banks and front companies that deal with North Korea. But some Asia experts say China would be readier to increase economic pressure on the regime if the US took up Beijing's push for negotiations to deal with the crisis.\nTuesday's launch was North Korea's first-ever test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\nState news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a \"gift\" to the Americans on their independence day.\nThe report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he had ordered officials to \"frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees\".\nPyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.\nNorth Korea, it said, was now \"a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world\".\nNorth Korea's missile programme in detail\nBy bringing Alaska within range, the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms.\nUS territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs.\nFor the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a \"real and present\" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper.\nPresident Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly.\nRead more from Dr Nilsson-Wright", "summary": "The US has said that it will use its \"considerable military forces\" on North Korea \"if we must\".", "id": "40513334", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe North Korean missile test was a \"sharp military escalation\" and a \"gift\" to the US, the US ambassador to the UN said.\nThe US will table a new resolution against Pyongyang, she", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe North Korean missile test was a \"sharp military escalation\" and a \"gift\" to the US, the US ambassador to the UN said.\nThe US will table a new resolution against Pyongyang, she", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe North Korean missile test was a \"sharp military escalation\" and a \"gift\" to the US, the US ambassador to the UN said.\nThe US will table a new resolution against Pyongyang, she", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe North Korean missile test was a \"sharp military escalation\" and a \"gift\" to the US, the US ambassador to the UN said.\nThe US is \"prepared to use the full range of our capabilities", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe North Korean missile test was a \"sharp military escalation\" and a \"gift\" to the US, the US ambassador to the UN said.\nThe US is \"prepared to use the full range of our capabilities", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\n1.

To be honest, it makes things much more exciting than usual.\nAs someone who watches a lot of Champions League football, I have got used to watching the same teams every year. Especially in the group stage, a lot of results are predictable, and some of the games are very dull.\nEuropean football could do with something unexpected happening to break up the established order. Having new teams such as Leicester involved means there is a greater chance of that, although it seems Uefa does not agree.\nThe changes being made to the Champions League from 2018 appear to be designed to filter out the elements that can cause surprises, rather than encourage them.\nThe evolution of the Champions League since the European Cup was remodelled in 1992 has resulted in more of a closed shop, and the new rules are only going to make things worse.\nFrom 2018, the top four domestic leagues - currently Spain, Germany, England and Italy - will get four guaranteed places in the Champions League group stage, meaning 16 of the 32 places are automatically taken.\nIn the past eight years, only one club from a country outside that top four - French Ligue 1 team Lyon in 2010 - have made it to the semi-finals. With fewer teams from other nations, the restructure is going to make it even harder for that to happen.\nEven more ludicrous is the decision to include historical successes when Uefa calculates the coefficient it uses for seeding, and for the distribution of prize money.\nThat means European trophies won in the 1960s will give clubs a bigger slice of the pie, and also give them easier draws to help keep the cash rolling in.\nIt is essentially money that has dictated this restructure, and it is clear that money still talks in Uefa, even with the recent shake-up in its hierarchy.\nIt has been accused by the European Professional Football Leagues body of being scared that the big clubs will run off and set up their own tournament.\nNew Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said on Wednesday that he will show those clubs who is in charge but, as things stand, it seems the governing body is trying to keep those select teams happy to the detriment of everyone else.\nI cannot see how that can be allowed to happen, although as a player I was used to decisions like this being made without being consulted at all.\nWe are in the same boat as fans in that regard - left to ask questions about what it will mean for us.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn any other business, anyone remodelling their product like this would have done market research - in this case, consulting fans - but Uefa has done none of that.\nWe are heading towards an NBA or NFL set-up with the same teams guaranteed to be involved every year, and there is no indication from anyone that this is what people want to watch. I know I don't.\nAt the moment, Premier League clubs are among those who will get four guaranteed group-stage places, up from the three - with one more in the play-off round - they currently have.\nBut I think it's important to make clear that just because English football is, generally, going to benefit from the changes, it doesn't mean we have to agree with what it means for the Champions League overall.\nMost of the money already gets distributed among the big clubs, and the gap is only going to get bigger when there are fewer spots to go around.\nWhere does that kind of escalation end? The Champions League is a monster eating up everything in its path - if you are not in it, you are just feeding it.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOne of the things Uefa did get right was making sure the champions of the leading seven leagues were top seeds for the first time in this year's draw.\nThat meant Leicester were rewarded for their unreal season by being drawn in a favourable group with Club Brugge, FC Copenhagen and FC Porto.\nThe concern before this campaign started was that the Foxes would struggle to cope with being in Europe because they can no longer pick the same 11 players every week like they did last season.\nBut I commented at the time that they were able to do that because their backroom staff were obviously monitoring their players really well - always looking ahead and being pro-active in preventing injuries rather than reacting to them when they were happened.\nThe Leicester coaches will have to modify their approach to deal with the demands of Champions League football - looking at factors such as where they are travelling, how far, plus when and how they train.\nBut I would imagine they just see this as another challenge, and have the same aim of giving Ranieri a squad of fully-fit players as often as possible again.\nWhatever happens with that, they will definitely retain a big part of what made them such a phenomenal team, which is their mental strength and togetherness.\nRanieri has been saying all week that his side have no chance of winning the Champions League but they have a great chance of getting out of their group. What happens after that will depend on the draw they get.\nAs Leicester have already proved, nothing is impossible - or at least not until Uefa can restructure things to rule it out.\nFormer England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "It was a breath of fresh air to see Leicester win the Premier League last season -

I've got a lot of pace. You've got to let me use it. And this radio rubbish sucks.\"\nHamilton pledged that he would allow Bottas back past him if he could not overtake a Ferrari.\nBottas complied and Hamilton set about the Ferraris, but although he closed on Raikkonen he was unable to pass, his car's aerodynamics too badly affected by the wake of the Ferrari on this tight and twisty track for him to get on to Raikkonen's tail.\nRaikkonen complained that he was \"uncomfortable\" with the situation but he played his role perfectly, with Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne watching from the pits.\nIt affirmed Raikkonen's position as a team player and will only make it more likely that he will be retained for next year as long as Vettel also stays.\nVerstappen will have some explaining to do after the race following the first-lap incident in which he took out team-mate Daniel Ricciardo.\nThe Australian had passed Verstappen on the outside on the run to Turn Two, after the Dutchman was forced wide by Bottas on the exit of Turn One.\nBut although Ricciardo was clearly ahead, Verstappen left his braking too late on the inside, and slid into his team-mate, smashing his radiator. Ricciardo spun into retirement on fluids from his own car at Turn Three, bringing out the safety car.\nRicciardo said: \"It's frustrating. It's not even an overtaking move. It's an emotional response - sees me pass him, wants to make it back and messed it up.\n\"I don't really know\u2026 in that moment I expect (the team) to say sorry and they will speak to Max and that's what they said. I don't know.\n\"Look, the way Max handles it, more than the way I handle it, will dictate how it goes in the future. For sure I can go and call him names but if he acts like the age he is, or if he acts like a man and admits the mistake.\"\nVerstappen's move earned him a 10-second penalty, served at his pit stop, which made it more difficult for him to challenge the Mercedes at the end.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nVettel: \"I am over the moon. It was a really difficult race. I had my hands full from three to four laps after the safety car, the steering started to go sideways and it started to get worse. It wasn't easy but it didn't do a favour to Kimi who could obviously go faster.\n\"You go down the straight and it's not straight. In right-handers it was OK, but in left-handers you had to go further than your head is telling you you should.\n\"I tried to hang in there as much as possible. The race felt very long.\"\nOn extending his championship lead, Vettel said: \"I don't mind. It's OK. Could be worse.\"\nBottas said: \"For sure in the end I was getting little bit worried because I was losing ground with all the backmarkers. So really thanks to Lewis for keeping his word.\"\nAn honourable mention, too, to Fernando Alonso, for his battling sixth place, forced to overtake Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz on track after being passed off the line, by far McLaren's best result of the season.

These are the patches of ground that were disturbed by the rockets of the skycrane at the moment of touchdown.\nTo give a sense of scale, the distance from the rover to the heatshield is 1,200m; to the parachute and backshell, 615m; and to the skycrane, 650m.\nMRO will get another picture of the landing site in five days' time but on that occasion it will be looking almost straight down instead of off to the side.\nIn this image, the team hope to get much better definition on the vehicle.\nThe main camera on the satellite - its High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRise) - can achieve a resolution of 30cm/pixel, so it may even be possible to see the shadows the robot casts on the ground.\nThe geologists on the mission team have taken a keen interest in the landing site image for what it tells them about the nature of the rocks in the area.\nIt is apparent from the picture that there are three distinct zones of ground.\nAt top-right is an area that previous observations have revealed to have high thermal inertia - it stays warmer longer at night, for example - than the broad area off to the left that holds all of the landing components other than the heatshield.\nThe third zone at bottom-right seems to display more impact cratering, which is usually indicative of being an older surface.\nVisiting the intersection of all three zones is now being considered as a possible science destination once the rover starts some serious driving in September.\nA signal confirming the Curiosity rover (also known as the Mars Science Laboratory, MSL) had landed on the Red Planet was received here at mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at 05:32 GMT; 06:32 BST on Monday (22:32 PDT Sunday).\nThe robot rover put down on the floor of a deep depression on Mars' equator known as Gale Crater.\nThe first hours on the surface have been spent checking out the health of the vehicle and retrieving some early engineering pictures that tell the mission team about the immediate vicinity where Curiosity landed.\nEfforts are currently under way to deploy the vehicle's high-gain antenna (HGA), which would provide a direct-to-Earth link through which to pass data.  At the moment, it is all being relayed back via MRO and Nasa's other Mars satellite, Odyssey.\nThe HGA task should have been completed on Sol 1 - the first full day of Martian surface operations - but the team is having to deal with a pointing error on the antenna.  This should be fixed on Sol 2.\nAlso on Sol 2, a command will be sent to lift the rover's mast, which holds its navigation cameras and the ChemCam laser instrument that can determine the chemistry of rocks from a distance.\nPerhaps one of the best pictures returned from the rover so far is the test shot from Mahli - the Mars Hand Lens Imager.\nThis camera is mounted on the rover's tool-bearing turret at the end of its robotic arm.\nThe picture, which was released early on Tuesday, gives us a real sense of being on Mars.\nYou can see some rocks in the near-field and the rim of Gale crater in the far-field.\nIt looks hazy simply because the transparent dust cover was left in place when the shot was taken, but the camera team says the image tells them the Mahli is in great shape.\n\"If it did not have dust on it, you would not know it had dust on it,\" explained Ken Edgett, the camera's principal investigator.\n\"The purpose of the first picture? We haven't used the camera and its focus mechanism since July last year [before we launched from Earth]. It was to check the instrument was working properly - and it is,\" he told BBC News.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter", "summary": "Nasa has used one of its satellites to image the Curiosity rover on Mars.", "id": "19172564", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The picture shows not only the six-wheeled vehicle, but also all the components of its discarded landing system.

His image among F1 insiders is not positive, a result of some of his critical outbursts against his team on the radio, and other stories about his attitude that have done the rounds.\nFriends tell of a jovial, amusing character who is fun to be around in private. But Di Resta has chosen not to show that side of himself to the world, a decision that must now be viewed as a mistake.\nAlthough there are still some seats open in F1 next year, none are believed to be available to Di Resta.\nThe 27-year-old is expected to switch to touring cars or endurance racing.\nDi Resta is most likely to return to drive for Mercedes in the German Touring Car Championship, which he won in 2010. Sources say he is tired of F1, feels he is finished with it and, as things stand, is unlikely to try to find a reserve driver role to keep his foot in the door.\nThe Briton made his debut for Force India in 2011 but after three seasons the team have decided they would be better to choose different drivers.\nHulkenberg overshadowed Di Resta when they were team-mates in the second half of 2012 and has continued to impress for Sauber this season.\nPerez, who has been dropped by McLaren after a season alongside Jenson Button, brings with him several million pounds worth of sponsorship from Mexico.\nPerez said: \"Coming here [to Force India] was always my first choice and I'm really happy everything has now been confirmed.\n\"This is a young team with a lot of determination and they've produced competitive cars for the last few years.\n\"It's all change for next season with the new regulations, but I already have a good feeling about 2014.\"\nDi Resta was overlooked by top teams Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren when they all changed their second drivers ahead of 2014.\nAnd his ability to find a seat elsewhere has been harmed by his lack of sponsorship budget.\nTeam bosses feel that he has not proved to be outstanding enough in his three seasons for it to be worth them taking the financial hit of signing him.\nSauber have not yet announced their line-up but there is understood to be no place for Di Resta at the Swiss team.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThey are expected to sign his former Force India team-mate Adrian Sutil as their lead driver. Their second seat is likely to go to either Mexican Esteban Gutierrez, who made his debut for Sauber in 2013, or a Russian in deference to their new business partners.\nThat could be former Lotus and Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov or the 19-year-old novice Sergey Sirotkin, who is considered more likely to become Sauber's reserve driver as a result of his lack of experience.\nBackmarker teams Caterham and Marussia have seats available, but Di Resta is not in the frame for them.\nMarussia have already signed Frenchman Jules Bianchi for a second season and are expected to keep hold of his 2013 team-mate Englishman Max Chilton as well.\nCaterham's line-up is still up in the air, with 2013 race drivers Giedo van der Garde and Charles Pic still options, along with GP2 driver Marcus Ericsson of Sweden, ex-McLaren, Renault and Caterham racer Heikki Kovalainanen and a number of others.\nDi Resta's manager Richard Goddard was unavailable for comment.", "summary": "Paul Di Resta's Formula 1 future is in serious doubt following Force India's decision to replace the Scot with Mexican Sergio Perez.", "id": "25346242", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nDi Resta's manager Richard Goddard was unavailable for comment.\nI'm not sure what you mean by that.\nI'm not sure what you mean by that.

Eastern Mediterranean and Africa have yet to gain a similar status.\nDr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO South East Asia regional director, said: \"This is very significant because before this region was certified polio-free, we had half the world's population polio free.\n\"With the South East Asia region being added we now have 80% of the population polio free.\n\"This was a problem the region was struggling with for a long time, but now finally, we are polio free.\"\nMany experts thought India would be the last country in the world to get rid of polio says Deepak Kapur, of Rotary International's India National Polio Plus Committee.\nHe said India faced several enormous challenges including its large population.\nHe said: \"India has close to 170 million children under five who needed to be immunised.\n\"Then there's the existence of insanitary conditions which helped the polio virus to proliferate - and impure drinking water because polio is a water borne disease.\"\nBut he said the fact that India had managed it and now the whole of South East Asia could be declared polio free sent a powerful and optimistic message to the three remaining polio-endemic countries.\nThe world signed up to eradicating polio in 1988. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched, which is a partnership between governments and organisations such as Unicef, the WHO and Rotary International. The aim was to banish polio once and for all.\nIn 1988 there were 350,000 recorded cases. By 2012 cases had fallen to 223. But last year there was a rise in cases to 406 new infections.\nThe increase is largely down to vaccination campaigns being interrupted by conflict. In October 2013, Syria reported its first case of polio since 1999. By March 2014 there were 25 cases.\nAn outbreak in the Horn of Africa, which started in May 2013, has seen 217 new cases in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia.\nWhile Thursday's announcement clearly marked an important milestone, there was still a long way to go, said Mr Kapur.\n\"Every child in the world is at risk of contracting polio until such a time as the wild polio virus is completely eradicated from every part of the world,\" he said.\n\"Until then no child - be it in North America or Europe - will be free of polio potentially hunting them down all over again.\n\"The only way to ensure the wild polio virus no longer exists in any part of the world is to wipe it out of every community in the world.\n\"It is not good enough to wipe it out on one continent and not the rest of the world because today the world is just one global village.\n\"The only way to keep polio away is through immunisation.\"\nHe said if every child on the planet were immunised, there would be nowhere for the virus to flourish and spread.\n\"Today's a big occasion for the entire global polio eradication initiative because if India - which had the most difficult of situations - can do it, others around the world can do it too,\" Mr Kapur said.\n\"So Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria need to replicate the example of India and go after this virus.\n\"Global eradication could and should be achieved in the very near future.\"\nCrossing Continents: Syria: The Silent Enemy is broadcast on 27 March at 11:00 GMT and 31 March at 20:30 GMT on BBC Radio 4.\nAssignment: Syria: The Silent Enemy is broadcast on 27 March at 08:06 GMT, 14:32 GMT, 19:06 GMT, 23:32 GMT, and 28 March at 03:32 GMT on BBC World Service.", "summary": "The World Health Organization has declared its South East Asia region polio-free.", "id": "26763385", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "6 GMT, 23:32 GMT, and 28 March at 03:32 GMT on BBC World Service.

Michael Schumacher is way ahead on 91.\n\"Not too bad, huh,\" said Hamilton. \"I was generally just chilling up front. When it rains it's usually a good day for me. It was tricky for everyone. There were definitely opportunities for aquaplaning, which everyone did.\n\"No mistakes, no issues, no spins. It was kind of interesting to hear how many people were spinning, but I didn't have that problem.\n\"I have always wanted to win since I watched Ayrton [Senna] win here in 1991. It has taken me a long time to get here and it is a historic day for me. To stand on the podium in Brazil where Ayrton was so loved was really special.\"\nRosberg said: \"Lewis just did a great job. It was very difficult conditions and I can live with second for sure.\"\nHamilton's closest rival for much of the race was Red Bull's Dutch driver Max Verstappen, who passed Rosberg around the outside of Turn Three on lap 32 on one of several restarts after a safety car period.\nHad Red Bull not gambled on fitting intermediate tyres to Verstappen's car on lap 43, the Dutchman would almost certainly have split the Mercedes drivers and left Rosberg needing a second place in Abu Dhabi.\nHowever, Verstappen's decision backfired. As the rain intensified, it became clear during a subsequent safety car period caused when Felipe Massa crashed on the pit straight on lap 48 that he needed to switch back to the full wets.\nThat left Verstappen down in 13th place but he set about recovering lost ground with incredible skill and gusto and fought up to pass Force India's Sergio Perez to take third into the fast Mergulho corner with two laps to go.\nIt was without question the most outstanding drive of an already stellar career that started only last year.\nAnd it also included an almost unbelievable moment when Verstappen had a half-spin on the straight but recovered the car and got going again without losing second place to Rosberg.\nThe race started under the safety car, and when it released the field after eight laps, Hamilton built a three-second lead in five laps before a crash by Sauber's Marcus Ericsson on the pit straight brought the safety car back out.\nSix laps later there was a restart, only for Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari to suffer a frightening-looking crash on the straight just after the start line, prompting race director Charlie Whiting to stop the race for the first time.\nThirty-five minutes later, the race started again under the safety car, only to be stopped again seven laps later when conditions were deemed too dangerous.\nAfter another 25-minute delay, it was restarted, the safety car pulling in after three laps and there were 16 laps of racing before Massa's crash.\nThat led to another safety car period, this time for seven laps, before the race was restarted and ran to the end.\nPerez held on for fourth, less than a second ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who survived a spin earlier in the race out of the last corner.\nAt the bottom of the top 10, Felipe Nasr scored a critical ninth place for Sauber. The result gives the Swiss team their first points of the season and moves them ahead of Manor into 10th in the championship.\nIf they hold on to that, it will be worth in the region of $16m in prize money to the team.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMassa's crash prompted emotional scenes as he waved to the crowd, some holding signs saying \"Obrigado, Massa\" - thank you Massa.\nThe popular Brazilian is retiring from F1 at the end of the season and was in tears as he walked back to the Williams pit draped in the Brazilian flag, cheered on by the crowd and applauded by members of other teams, before being embraced by his wife, son Felipe Jr, and then his crew members.\nSeveral members of other teams, including his old team Ferrari, then walked out of their garages to the edge of the pit boxes and applauded him as he walked down the pitlane back to his garage as the cars continued to race.

Some might say the girl's mother's attention was directed towards that procedure rather than grieving at this time,\" Ms Fleetwood added.\n\"But her daughter had passed away, the procedure needed to be carried out.\"\nThe case had not set a precedent for future cases around cryopreservation, she said.\nThe girls' parents were divorced and the girl had not had any contact with her father for six years before she became ill.\nWhile the girl's mother supported her wishes to have her body preserved, her father was against it.\nHe said: \"Even if the treatment is successful and she is brought back to life in let's say 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things and she may be left in a desperate situation given that she is only 14 years old and will be in the United States of America.\"\nAlthough he then changed his mind, saying he respected his daughter's decision, he subsequently wanted to see his daughter's body after her death - something to which she would not agree.\nThe judge said the girl's application was the only one of its kind to have come before a court in England and Wales - and probably anywhere else.\nMr Justice Jackson said the case was an example of science posing new questions to lawyers.\nThe girl died peacefully in October knowing that her remains would be preserved, but the judge said there had been problems on the day she died.\nHe said hospital staff and bosses had expressed concerns about the way the process of preparing her body for cryogenic preservation had been handled.\nThis was carried out by a voluntary group in the UK before her body was flown to the US for storage.\nHe suggested that ministers should consider \"proper regulation\" of cryonic preservation for the future.", "summary": "A 14-year-old girl who wanted her body to be preserved, in case she could be cured in the future, won a historic legal fight shortly before her death.", "id": "38012267", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe girl, who died in October, has been taken to the US and preserved there.

There are Longines and Bulgari watches and jewellery on sale that cost more than $10,000 (\u00c2\u00a37,700), well beyond the annual budget of ordinary Cuban families.\nAs a handful of school-uniformed teenagers emerged, smiling and empty-handed, from L'Occitane en Provence, I asked them how much the hand creams and facial scrubs were inside.\n\"Impossibly expensive!\" one of them giggled.\n\"I'm just here to look and admire,\" said Diana, a middle-aged woman staring at the window display of Nikon cameras.\nFurther inside, Antonio simply laughed at the price tags on the Armani suits. \"Do you know what Cubans earn?\" he asked rhetorically.\nOfficially, state wages in Cuba are around $25 a month, meaning these shops are intended for foreign visitors or a new brand of wealthy Cuban.\nIn its heyday the Manzana de Gomez was the finest shopping experience in the Caribbean. Today, it's the latest step in rebuilding Old Havana, the crumbling colonial centre of the Cuban capital.\nBuilt in the early 1900s by a Cuban businessman, Jose Gomez-Mena Vila, the five-storey shopping mall has been painstakingly restored over the past few years and turned into a five-star hotel, the Hotel Manzana, run by the Swiss chain, Kempinski.\nThe shopping complex on the ground floor - as well as the hotel prices of $440 a night for the cheapest room and almost $2,500 for the most expensive - are indications of the type of upscale clientele they're aiming for.\nAlthough managed by the Swiss firm, the luxurious property is owned by the tourism wing of the Cuban military, Gaviota, in the kind of international partnership that is likely to form the blueprint for major tourism infrastructure in Cuba in the coming years.\nOn Wednesday, Cuba's high society turned out in force for the official unveiling. However, while the Cuban authorities will undoubtedly be pleased of new hotel rooms amid a tourism boom, it also comes at a sensitive time.\nCubans and Americans alike are waiting to see if President Donald Trump continues with Barack Obama's policy of engagement with Cuba or reverses it, and puts the bilateral relationship back onto a more hostile footing. Many fear the latter.\nSpecifically working with Gaviota - or any military-owned company in Cuba - has been cited as one of the key reasons the Trump Administration is considering a rollback on President Obama's thaw.\nPresident Trump is being urged by the traditional anti-Castro lobby in Florida to prevent any US entity from working with the commercial wings of the Cuban military and to \"treat Cuba like the dictatorship it is\", as Florida Senator Marco Rubio put it recently.\nFurthermore,  the US president might make it harder for Americans to reach the island by reinstating parts of the travel ban lifted by his predecessor.\nSupporters of President Obama's policy of thaw point to numbers released by the popular accommodation website, AirBnB. They claim that bookings through their page have generated $40m for Cubans since 2015, and that 58% of the beneficiaries were women.\nMeanwhile the pro-engagement lobby group, Engage Cuba, has argues that the cost to the US of reversing the policy of thaw would be $6.6bn in lost revenue for airline and cruise ship companies among others.\nBack amid the expensive Gucci handbags and earrings, I met Francisco, a retired agronomist with dark skin and a shock of silver hair. He was quick to acknowledge that there are those who resent the exorbitant prices of the Manzana de Gomez.\nFor him, that reaction only tells half the story.\n\"Tourism is the motor of our economy now,\" he said, with unerring clarity. \"These prices, I understand, are the same the world over so why wouldn't tourists want to buy a memento from Cuba?\" nodding at some costly-looking silver-plated fountain pens.\n\"I live off the libreta\" he told me frankly - a reference to the ration book which still covers the basic staple goods like eggs and powdered milk for most Cuban households.\n\"But there are now Cubans who can afford these things,\" he shrugged.", "summary": "Schoolkids taking selfies outside expensive stores is doubtless a feature of high-end shopping malls everywhere.", "id": "40196930", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"Cuba is a communist country, but it is also a capitalist country.\"\n\"I'm not a communist, but I'm not a capitalist either,\" he said. \"I'm a Cuban.\"\n", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"Cuba is a communist country, but it is also a capitalist country.\"\n\"I'm not a communist, but I'm not a capitalist either,\" he said. \"I'm a Cuban.\"\n", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "1.

His brother Dzhokhar, was wounded but survived, and has been charged over the bombings.\nThe Beth Israel Deaconess hospital in Massachusetts said at noon on Tuesday that the surviving brother's condition had improved from \"serious\" to \"fair\", according to the US Attorney's Office in Boston.\nThe Tsarnaev brothers had origins in the troubled, predominantly Muslim republic of Chechnya in southern Russia. They had been living in the US for about a decade at the time of the attack.\nQ&A: Possible FBI failings\nMembers of Congress want to know why no further action was taken after Tamerlan Tsarnaev was investigated in 2011 at the request of the Russian government.\nIn 2012 he travelled to Russia, and spent six months in Dagestan, another mainly Muslim Russian republic bordering Chechnya. During the visit, he also reportedly spent two days in Chechnya itself.\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham had questioned why the FBI was unable to identify him as a threat based on his alleged links to radical websites.\nHe called for better co-operation with Russia and the amendment of privacy laws to allow closer scrutiny of suspects' internet activity.\nSpeaking after the Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington, Republican Senator Susan Collins said there appeared to be \"serious problems with sharing information, including critical investigative information ... not only among agencies but also within the same agency in one case\", the Associated Press reports.\nProfile: The Tsarnaev brothers\nHow to interrogate a suspect\nTamerlan Tsarnaev: A lone wolf\nQ&A: Suspects' Chechen links\nMaps of manhunt\nTimeline of manhunt\nThe vice-chairman of the committee, Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss, said he could not see \"anybody yet that dropped the ball\", but that he was still seeking information on whether information was properly shared.\n\"If it wasn't, we've got to fix this,\" AP quoted him as saying.\nThe FBI has defended itself, saying in a statement on Friday that it had run checks on the suspect but found no evidence of terrorist activity.\nIt said a request to Russia for further information to justify more rigorous checks went unanswered, and an interview by agents with Tsarnaev and his family also revealed nothing suspicious.\nIn a separate hearing on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the FBI had been aware of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia, contradicting Senator Graham's allegation that the trip had been overlooked because his name had been misspelled in travel documents.\nThe twin bombs which exploded near the finishing line of the marathon killed three people and injured more than 200, many of them seriously.\nOn Tuesday, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino announced that a compensation fund for victims of the attack had received $20m (\u00c2\u00a313.2m) in the week since it was launched, with donations streaming in from Boston and across the world.\nOn Monday, a 10-page criminal complaint was filed against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev during a court hearing around his hospital bed.\nFederal prosecutors have charged him with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death. He could be sentenced to death if convicted on either count.\nAccording to a transcript of the hearing, he managed to speak once despite a gunshot wound to his throat sustained during his capture.\nMr Tsarnaev said the word \"no\" when asked if he could afford a lawyer. Otherwise he nodded in response to Judge Marianne Bowler's questions from his bed at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\nThe next hearing in his case has been scheduled for the end of May.\nThe complaint seeks to locate both suspects at the scene of the bombing and then pieces together the operation to intercept them three days later, as they allegedly drove a hijacked car near the city, hours after images of their faces were broadcast by the media.\nNo mention is made of their possible reasons for attacking the marathon.\nAnonymous officials have told US media that 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev said he and his brother had planned the attack themselves without help from foreign militants.\nThe officials say his written answers from his hospital bed to investigators' questions lead them to believe that the pair were motivated by jihadist ideology and that they devised the bombings using the internet.\nHowever, the sources also said the interviews were preliminary and they must verify the defendant's responses.\nLawyers for Katherine Russell, the widow of 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, said that their client was doing everything she could to assist authorities.\nShe is \"trying to come to terms with these events\", her lawyers said in a statement on Tuesday, without saying whether she had been questioned by investigators.\n\"The report of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all.\"", "summary": "US security officials have been questioned by Congress over whether they mishandled information about the Boston bomb suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev.", "id": "22262452", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22351191?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22351191?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22351191?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22351191?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22351191?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe FBI has defended itself, saying in a statement on Friday that it had run checks on the suspect but found no evidence of terrorist activity.

Latest figures from Public Health England show that between 2012 and 2015 gonorrhoea infections rose by 53%, from 26,880 to 41,193.\nMedics are increasingly concerned that the infection may eventually become untreatable, following the emergence of \"super-gonorrhoea\" - a drug-resistant strain that can dodge the usual antibiotic used to treat it.\nPublic Health England recently detected an outbreak of azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea in northern England.\nFortunately, the strain can still be treated with another antibiotic called ceftriaxone, but PHE says there's no room for complacency and it's monitoring the situation carefully.\nIf azithromycin becomes ineffective against gonorrhoea, there is no \"second lock\" to prevent or delay the emergence of ceftriaxone resistance and gonorrhoea may become untreatable, they warn.\nCases were first spotted in Leeds in November 2014.\nIt then spread to the West Midlands and the south of England, with five cases found in London.\nBy April 2016, the total number of people identified with the infection had reached 34 and included heterosexual couples and men who have sex with men.\nCondoms are the best way to stop gonorrhoea spreading, but some experts believe there may also be another opportunity - mouthwash.\nStudies suggests the throat could be a breeding ground for hard-to-treat bacteria.\nGonorrhoea can persist here without symptoms and swap DNA with other throat microbes that already know how to dodge certain antibiotics.\nProf Christopher Fairley from Monash University has been testing the mouthwash theory in 58 male volunteers.\nAll of the men had detectable levels of throat gonorrhoea at the start of the trial.\nHe asked half of them to gargle and swill for a minute with saltwater while he gave the others a branded antiseptic mouthwash, bought from a supermarket, to use instead.\nHe retested them five minutes later to see if the gargling had helped. It appeared to, reducing the detectable amount of bacteria significantly more than the saltwater rinse.\nProf Fairley says more studies are needed to check how long this effect might last and what protection it might offer.\nHe's now recruiting more volunteers to take part in a three-month trial to see what impact daily gargling might have on gonorrhoea throat carriage.\nDr Anatole Menon-Johansson is an expert in sexual health and clinical director for the charity Brook.\nHe says Prof Fairley \"could well be on to something\".\n\"I heard his presentation at a medical conference and I was really impressed. It's obviously still only a hypothesis. There's lots more to do and explore. But it's interesting, and it's got everybody thinking.\n\"If you could use a mouthwash there's a chance at the population level that it might make a difference to infection rates.\"\nMen visiting his sexual health clinic are offered pharyngeal testing for gonorrhoea.\nIf the test comes back positive, the clinic runs extra checks to see what treatments the bacteria will respond to and which ones are doomed to fail because of drug resistance.\n\"These organisms have been with us humans for thousands of years and will continue to be. The challenge is working out ways to control transmission and make sure we have drugs that can still treat it.\"\nDr Gwenda Hughes, Head of the Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Section at Public Health England (PHE), said: \"Gonorrhoea infection in the throat usually has no symptoms but both men and women can get it by having unprotected oral sex.\n\"The only protection is by using condoms when having sex with new or casual partners and it's important to have regular check-ups at a sexual health clinic. Sexually active gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men should get tested for STI's at least every three months.\n\"PHE continues to monitor, and act on, the spread of antibiotic resistance and potential gonorrhoea treatment failures by investigating identified cases, sexual history and treatment to make sure they are managed promptly.\"", "summary": "\"A gargle a day keeps gonorrhoea away\" is an unlikely slogan, but researchers believe it could hold some truth.", "id": "36765167", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

The men then made their way to an upstairs parking area where they saw \"a lot of dead people\".\nMr Haji was in a group of five including three plain-clothes police officers, one of whom had been shot and was holding his stomach.\nThey entered the mall on the top floor and went from shop to shop.\n\"We saw some people lying on the floor. We started shouting 'we're police, get out, get out', and we started doing this at every store.\"\nThey made their way down to the ground floor, where they engaged the gunmen, receiving backup from two security officials in protective gear and armed with tear gas.\nThey could see a woman hiding under a table, who said she was with three children. They asked her to tell the older child to run to them.\nMr Haji said he was in the mall for three or four hours, helping people escape from a toilet, a bank and a burger restaurant. His brother also managed to flee.\nMr Singh made reference to a British ex-soldier he spoke to who was also trying to evacuate people from the complex.\nAnd several British newspapers have also spoken of an-ex Royal Marine who was involved in the rescue effort.\nSome have published an image of a man escorting two women away from the scene, with what appears to be a gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans.\nHis face, however, is pixellated as he apparently cannot be named or identified because of security concerns.\nEighteen-year-old Zachary Yach was having lunch with his mother and sister at a burger restaurant in the complex when the attack began.\n\"A huge explosion really swept us off our feet... So we just dropped to the floor under the table, put our heads down and curled up for a good 20 or 30 minutes,\" Mr Yach told the BBC's Will Ross.\nOnce the noise of grenades and gunfire had subsided, \"we put our heads up to see what was going on\", and saw bodies and two badly injured people, Mr Yach said.\nOne man had been shot in the arm and \"managed to grab a knife and come towards us.\n\"He cut his T-shirt and tied it around - we helped him and tried to get him to keep pressure on.\"\nHe told his mother to play dead \"but I kept an eye open to see what was going on and if they [the attackers] were coming into the restaurant\".\nAfter about two-and-a-half hours, the police arrived with the army and a gun battle began.\nWhen he saw that a team of security services had entered the restaurant, he \"lifted up my hand and whistled to say: 'Come here we need help,'\" Mr Yach says.\n\"I got my mum and sister to go first and then we went back to help the guy with the blood running from his head and the guy with the bullet wound in his arm.

The council leader, Antal Rogan, said that it had his approval because it was not just about the occupation, but because \"we are erecting a monument to all the victims, including hundreds of thousands of Holocaust victims - those who were deported, abused and murdered\".\nBut a leading member of the Socialist Party, Csaba Horvath, said that the government's plans risked \"dividing society and creating a fresh scandal by falsifying history\".\nSzabolcs Kerek-Barczy, a member of the leadership of the left-wing Democratic Coalition, said that by erecting the monument, Fidesz would be sending \"a symbolic gesture to the current Hungarian far-right and to neo-Nazis\".\nCritics say the government is focusing on the last year or so of the war, when Hungary was occupied by German troops after its leadership attempted to make peace with the Allies, and so airbrushing the previous years of collaboration with the Nazis.\nIn an interview with the independent Hungarian TV channel ATV, Mr Kerek-Barczy also said that the plan was a deliberate attempt on the part of the government \"to gain far-right votes - the votes of neo-Nazis are valuable to them too\".\nJobbik is currently the third largest party in the Hungarian parliament, and many analysts see Fidesz's efforts to woo nationalist voters as part of a campaign to prevent a large part of its natural support base from ebbing away to Jobbik in the next election.\nA group of 26 leading Hungarian historians has issued an open letter - published on the Galamus news and opinion website - in which they protested against the plan, saying that: \"The memorial falsifies an important period of our history, and relativises the Holocaust in Hungary.\"\nOne of the signatories to the petition is the historian Krisztian Ungvary, an expert on World War Two who earlier in the week published an article on the news website hvg.hu in which he lambasted those who he said were \"wasting public funds\" in an effort to \"whitewash\" Hungary's war-time history.\nJobbik, on the other hand, has welcomed the memorial plan, but insists that it does not go far enough and that it is now time to remove a monument to the 1945 Soviet liberation of Hungary from the square on which the new monument will be erected.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

I hope the divorce will proceed with a view on minimizing economic damage to all impacted by the Brexit.\"\nToyota, which employs 540 workers at its Deeside engine plant, said:  \"Going forward we will closely monitor and analyse the impact on our business operations in the UK, and how we can maintain competitiveness and secure sustainable growth together with the UK automotive industry and other stakeholders.\"\nTata Steel said: \"Decisions by the UK electorate will always be respected by Tata Steel. Whatever the political framework, we are committed to developing the best prospects possible for our UK operations.\"\nAston Martin, which has plans to open a factory at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, warned that the company was likely to require additional \"productivity and efficiency\" gains.\nChief executive Andy Palmer said the UK Government must \"maintain economic stability and secure a deal with the EU which safeguards UK automotive interests - this includes securing tariff-free access to European and other global markets.\"\nFord said it would \"take whatever action is needed to ensure that our European business remains competitive and keeps to the path toward sustainable profitability\".\nCBI Wales wants strong and calm leadership from the UK Government, adding: \"The British people's vote to leave the EU is a momentous turning point in our history. The country has spoken and it's for us all to listen\".\nThe Federation of Small Business in Wales called for stability for the business community.\nPolicy unit chair Janet Jones said: \"Nearly a quarter of FSB members across the UK export, with the majority exporting to the single market. Access to the single market means access to 500 million potential consumers, more than 26 million businesses and is worth 11 trillion euros.\n\" We call on the Government for clarity on the impact to smaller firms who export wider afield through EU FTA agreements.\"\nChris Nott, senior partner at Capital Law and chair of the Welsh Government's financial and professional services advisory panel was scathing, saying: \"I hadn't realised that so many people in this country could have been misled by the garbage of information that the leaders of the leave campaign either manipulated or made up.\n\"Those fraudsters have set back our country for generations and have messed up my children's future.\"\nThe South and Mid Wales Chamber of Commerce wants assurances that universities, farmers and organisations reliant on EU funding would not lose out.\nPresident Liz Maher said: \"Going forward it is important that the result is accepted across the board. Politicians must now coalesce and put differences aside to ensure a strong government can negotiate the best deal for Welsh businesses, especially those trading with Europe.\"\nThe Federation of Master Builders said it was important \"the free-flowing tap of migrant workers from Europe is not turned off\" with at present 12% of  British construction workers of non-UK origin.\nWhile larger businesses -  employing 38% of private sector workers in Wales - were mainly in favour of remaining by a significant margin, there was more of a split with smaller firms.\nSmall businesses - responsible for 50% of private sector workers - are a major force in the Welsh economy.\nThose who trade with the EU may feel concerned about access to the single market and whether they will now face tariffs, making their products more expensive.\nHowever, whether they trade with the EU or not, all businesses feel the impact of regulations.\nExcessive red tape is a common complaint from small businesses, even those who were in favour of remaining.\nThey will be hoping Brexit may change some of that.", "summary": "Wales has a small number of big companies but they employ a large number of people.", "id": "36619409", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe UK has voted to leave the European Union.\nThe UK has voted to leave the European Union.

His Gaelic name is Colum Cille - \"the dove of the Church\".\nHe is widely credited as one of the key figures who brought Christianity to Scotland.\nFrom his vision sprang Iona Abbey, which became a centre of literacy, learning and worship.\nAfter his death Iona became a place of pilgrimage for kings and commoners. 60,000 of the latter still visit the rebuilt abbey every year.\nBut did Columba leave any physical trace?\nHis successor Adomn\u00e1n, writing 100 years after the saint's death, described him working in his cell on a rocky hillock.\nThat knoll is called T\u00f2rr an Aba - \"the mound of the abbot\".\nSixty years ago the site was excavated by a team led by the Cornish historian and archaeologist Charles Thomas.\nIt was early in a career in which he became the leading archaeologist of early Christianity in Britain and Ireland, with posts at Edinburgh and Leicester universities.\nHe eventually became the first professor of Cornish studies at Exeter University and a Bard of the Cornish Gorseth.\nHis dig in 1957 made an intriguing discovery.\nOn T\u00f2rr an Aba the diggers found hazel charcoal, apparently the remains of a wattle hut.\nThe site had been deliberately covered with beach pebbles and there was a hole where a post - possibly a cross - had been placed.\nWere these the remains of Columba's cell? Charles Thomas thought so.\nIf only they could be accurately dated. But in 1957 that was impossible.\nThe technique of radiocarbon dating was in its infancy then. It measures the level of carbon 14, a radioactive isotope, to assess the age of a sample of organic material.\nBut 60 years ago the process was expensive, required the destruction of a relatively large sample, and the dates it produced had a wide margin of error.\nSo Charles Thomas did not write up his findings in an academic paper. Instead he carefully preserved the samples from the dig along with his notes.\nHe took the remains with him from university to university. After he retired he stored them in his garage in Truro.\nWhich is where they sat until five years ago when a project led by University of Glasgow archaeologists Dr Ewan Campbell and Dr Adri\u00e1n Maldonado heard of them.\nProf Thomas was happy to hand them over for testing using radiocarbon techniques of an accuracy unimaginable six decades ago.\nThe project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland and supported by the National Trust for Scotland, had the samples tested by the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre.\nThe result? The remains of the hazel stakes date the hut between the years 540 and 650. Columba died in 597.\nAdri\u00e1n Maldonado says it is \"within a standard deviation of the lifetime of St Columba\", which he says is \"about the closest you can get to being certain that it is something that was standing when Columba was on Iona\".\nHistoric Environment Scotland's Senior Archaeologist Richard Strachan is similarly enthusiastic.\nHe said: \"It's fantastic, it absolutely nails it. There's no debate. We can actually prove this scientifically. This is real. This actually happened here.\"\nHistoric Environment Scotland are funding the project as part of Scotland's Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology 2017.\nAs well as re-opening some of the 60-year-old trenches to look for more dating material, Doctors Campbell and Maldonado are writing up Charles Thomas's personal archive.\nSome of the early findings are being unveiled at the 8th International Insular Art Conference at the University of Glasgow.\nDr Campbell says it is extremely rare to be able to associate any archaeological deposits with a figure from the past.\nHe said: \"This being Columba, who is so important as a spiritual figure and as a person who founded this series of monasteries which cultivated that learning which spread throughout Europe, it's really important.\n\"It's really exciting to be able to touch some of the things that were associated with him.\"\nSixty years on, some of Prof Thomas's fellow diggers on Iona are still alive.\nThey were as sure as they could be that this was the saint's scriptorium, but lacked the backing of modern radiocarbon dating.\nSadly Charles Thomas did not live to see his work vindicated. He died last year before the definitive date of his samples could be established.\nBut Dr Maldonado is in no doubt about the significance of his legacy: \"What Charles Thomas and his team found - and couldn't prove until now - was that we've been walking on the early monastery this whole time.\"", "summary": "Archaeologists say they have identified the remains of the cell of St Columba on the Scottish island of Iona.", "id": "40556985", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1.

If 22 join the Democrats, the bill will fail.\nBut US media tallies suggest between 28 and 35 Republicans still remain opposed.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan visited the White House on Friday to give Mr Trump an update on the numbers, with US media reporting that there were not enough.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said that No votes were still being won over and \"we are getting closer and closer\", but suggested it was unclear whether the 215 threshold would be reached.\nHe said the president had \"given his all\" and \"left everything on the field\" in trying to win over votes.\nMr Spicer said the vote was still scheduled for 15:30 (19:30 GMT) and it was \"now up to the members of the House to decide\".\nOn Thursday, Mr Trump reportedly told mutinous Republicans that if they did not vote for his bill - dubbed Trumpcare by Democrats - they would be stuck with President Obama's act for good, and he would move on with the rest of his agenda.\nThe moment Republicans have been anticipating for seven years has almost arrived. They will have the chance to take a major first step toward rolling back the healthcare reform passed by Barack Obama and Democrats.\nSo why is it that almost no Republicans seem happy?\nModerates are upset that the proposed legislation cuts health coverage too much. Hard-liners are angry the changes don't go far enough. Donald Trump is warning that if things don't go his way, he'll abandon the whole effort.\nThe president's move effectively forces the hand of recalcitrant members of Congress. The moderates seem unlikely to budge, so it all comes down to the libertarian-leaning Freedom Caucus conservatives. Is half a repeal loaf better than no loaf at all?\nLooming over all of this is the stark reality that the proposed legislation is woefully unpopular with the public at large - garnering just 17% approval in one recent poll. Conservative interest groups are sharply divided over whether to support the bill or not.\nWhat should have been a moment of triumph for Republicans in Congress has turned into an exercise in political pain minimalisation.\nMr Trump has already suffered one setback when Republican leaders delayed a Thursday vote in the House, which the White House had insisted it would win.\nThe president kept up the pressure on Friday morning, tweeting \"this is finally your chance for a great plan!\"\nAnother tweet targeted the conservative Freedom Caucus, many of whose members have opposed the bill.\nThough Mr Trump gave little away when asked about the vote on Friday, he did say Mr Ryan should stay on even if the measure collapsed.\nRepealing Obamacare was a major plank of Mr Trump's election campaign, but its replacement has stalled amid Republican infighting, with the current reforms going too far for some and not far enough for others.\nA number of controversial last-minute changes were made to placate conservatives, including ending Obamacare's requirement that insurers cover \"essential benefits\" including maternity care, mental health services and prescription drugs.\nBut it was unclear if this was enough to sway them.\nIn the House debate, Republican supporters of the bill targeted both what they called the failures of the Obamacare but also the need to honour the pledge the party had made in the election.\nDemocrats railed against the content of the bill, saying it was less about health and more a tax rebate for the wealthy. Many read out case studies of people who had benefited from Obamacare.\nObamacare helped 20 million previously uninsured Americans get health insurance but has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums, which were also a problem before the health law.\nMr Trump promised a new law that would cover more people and at a lower cost.

Instead of grazing, they used specialised arms to browse for food in trees and shrubs.\n\"We've known for a while that sthenurines were different in their dietary behaviour,\" said lead author Prof Christine Janis, a palaeontologist at Brown University in the US.\n\"But the idea that they might have used a different kind of locomotion has not been thought about.\"\nThe idea of a walking giant roo first dawned on Prof Janis 10 years ago, when she was looking at their bones in a Sydney museum.\n\"Bones are great. Bones are really informative!\" she told BBC News.\n\"I thought: Wait a minute, this doesn't look right. These things were weird.\"\nOther researchers had already proposed that the giant beasts would have found it very difficult, if not impossible to walk on all fours, because of their short, stiff spines and their slender arms with long fingers for grabbing foliage.\n\"And that's the gait that kangaroos use most of the time. They have what's called a pentapedal gait, where the tail is used as a fifth limb,\" Prof Janis explained. Hopping is only used to cover larger distances, faster.\nSo in the absence of the usual option for slow movement, Prof Janis thought, would this big family of kangaroos really hop absolutely everywhere?\n\"That's what I always find intriguing about fossils. Can you shoehorn them into some kind of living paradigm, or are they doing something different?\"\nAfter many more visits to Australian museums, where she made up to 101 different measurements on the skeletons of 78 extinct kangaroo specimens, as well as 66 present-day examples, Prof Janis found that the vanished marsupials did, indeed, appear to be doing something completely different.\nThe sthenurines' long bones tended to be heavier and stronger than the relatively slender ones seen in big, hopping modern kangaroos. Furthermore, they had specific features well-suited to walking rather than hopping.\nThese included large hip bones that were oriented to support an upright body, and flared to accommodate big gluteal muscles, suggesting the ancient roos could support their weight on one leg.\n\"They had anatomy that is consistent with the hypothesis of bipedal walking,\" Prof Janis said.\n\"Now, why would they start to do that?\"\nShe and her colleagues argue that the early sthenurines, which were smaller, probably started walking short, slow distances on their hind legs as an alternative to using all fours.\nThen, as they evolved to become bigger and stockier, they may have become distance walkers and lost the ability to hop.\n\"The biggest ones got to a size that does strain the credulity of hopping,\" Prof Janis said - although she emphasised it is difficult to prove that the big beasts didn't make equally big bounds.\n\"Obviously you're going out on a limb when you're proposing something about an extinct animal. But all the data fit.\"\nShe said her argument was not an unreasonable stretch, given that some tree kangaroos found in Papua New Guinea have been reported to walk on their hind legs.\nDr Vera Weisbecker, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Queensland in Australia, said she found the study very convincing.\n\"The idea has been around that sthenurines may have just been too large to hop, particularly those really large forms,\" she told the BBC.\nThe explanation that they walked on two feet, Dr Weisbecker said, \"may just not have ever entered people's heads\".\n\"It's a very unusual thing to propose. And they're making a very good case.\"\nAnother marsupial expert, Dr Natalie Warburton from Murdoch University in Perth, also said the finding was unexpected.\nShe said the adjustments found in the sthenurines' skeletons definitely suggested a different style of getting around, but added that \"precisely what that style of locomotion was is probably still going to be debated\".\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter", "summary": "They roamed Australia while mammoths and Neanderthals lived in Europe - and it now seems they did so by putting one heavy foot in front of the other.", "id": "29603578", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 30,", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 30,", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 30,", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 30,", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 30,", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 20,", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died 20,00", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe idea of a walking giant roo first dawned on Prof Janis 10 years ago, when she was looking at their bones in a Sydney museum.\n\"And that's the gait that kangaroos use", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones of 78 extinct kangaroo species and 66 present-day examples.\nThe researchers found", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\nThe idea that sthenurines may have just been too large to hop, particularly those really large forms, has been around for a while.\nThe idea that sthenurines may have just been too large to hop, particularly those really", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "\nThe study, published in the journal Plos One, is a detailed comparison between the size and shape of the bones found in living kangaroo species and those of the sthenurines, which died out some 30,", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nThe study is published in the journal Plos One.\nThe researchers say the findings suggest the extinct kangaroos were able to walk on two legs.\nThe researchers say the findings suggest the extinct kang", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_2": "This is a very interesting study.

And more can be found on.....\nBBC news website user Maggie McGonigle asks: \"How would fiscal independence specifically work with job creation in Scotland?\" Colin Armstrong and Scott Millar also ask jobs-related questions.\nFor most voters the key test of whether the economy is healthy or not can be summed up in one word - JOBS.\nIf employment is on the rise then it's usually assumed the economy is heading in the right direction.\nMore jobs tend to mean the economy is growing. Lower unemployment tends to mean fewer lives and communities blighted. Shorter dole-queues tend to mean the government(s) of the day can relax a little, safe in the knowledge that a political backlash has been staved off for a while.\nOlder readers may remember the 1979 general election and the Conservative poster campaign, \"Labour isn't working\". That election saw Labour swept from power for years. Many of us recall the fierce political rows during the 1980s, as UK unemployment soared to more than three million.\nWhether Scotland votes \"Yes\" or \"No\", it really is unclear whether there would be a growing workforce and shorter dole-queues.\nWe're emerging from a long economic downturn.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 saw banks collapse like dominoes, and unemployment soar - not just in Scotland and the UK, but in most Western countries.\nThis economic heart-attack ushered in years of stagnation, with many countries still struggling to emerge from the downturn.\nSome - like Greece and Italy - are still in recession. The UK, by contrast, has picked up in recent months, and its economy's grown faster than any other country in the G7 group of leading industrial nations.\nThis recovery's taken many by surprise: the IMF and others have had to revise upwards their predictions for economic growth, as the UK's economy performed better than expected.\nThe jobless rate in Scotland has fallen to 6% in the period May to July. That's now just below the rate of 6.2% for the UK as a whole.\nUnemployment in Scotland has fallen by 35,000 compared to the same period last year. Scotland's economy is now bigger than it was before the crash of 2008. Employment in Scotland - the total workforce - rose by 87,000 in the year, and is at an all-time high.\nThe UK economy has changed dramatically since the 1970s. The labour market is now far more flexible. During the downturn, this helped keep the jobless total much lower than some had feared.\nMass unemployment was replaced by widespread under-employment, as people eked out part-time jobs, or seasonal or casual or fixed-term work. The result's been a record level of employment, even if the UK's economy has failed to deliver higher living standards for its citizens.\nIn the last year in the UK we've seen employment rise by more than 800,000.\nThe Better Together campaign argues that a \"Yes\" vote in the referendum puts the UK's recovery at risk, and it claims that political divorce - however amicable - would create barriers to growth.\nIt says uncertainty over a future Scottish currency, tax rates and EU membership threaten the UK's single market, and Scottish companies' ability to trade internationally, with a consequent threat to jobs and livelihoods.\nHowever, the Yes campaign says independence would create not risk, but opportunities to grow the Scottish economy and boost the workforce.\nIt claims an independent Scottish government, with all the economic levers at its disposal, would be able to fine-tune the environment for businesses, growth and jobs better than Westminster can do right now. Its supporters point to other small countries - like New Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland - which are wealthy and successful - and ask: \"Why not here?\"\nEvery month, when the official employment figures are released, politicians pore over the data, comparing Scotland with the UK as a whole. Sometimes it seems we're doing better - at other times, worse. But that obscures a key issue. Some argue the right comparison for Scotland to make should NOT be with the whole of the UK - but with its regions.\nRight now, London and the south-east are generating high numbers of new private sector jobs.\nAnd Scotland's economy is performing pretty strongly as well. Other parts of the UK lag further behind.\nSo, whether or not Scotland chooses independence, voters here may well ask in the future: \"How does our level of job creation compare with the richest regions of these islands?\"\nAnd the challenge for all our political leaders will be to ensure Scotland's rate of employment and job creation rise up the UK's league table, into the future.", "summary": "As the people of Scotland weigh up how to vote in the independence referendum, they are asking questions on a range of topics.", "id": "29219337", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe UK's economy has changed dramatically since the 1970s.

But when I'm playing a match my mood is fantastic\".\nBoth men have been monitored closely by Prof Peter Krustrup, a sports and health specialist from Copenhagen University.\n\"The most important finding is that street football is a feasible, fun and social way to improve the physical capacity and health profile of homeless men,\" says Prof Krustrup after watching a training session in a graffiti decorated hall in an former Copenhagen brewery.\nThe strenuous physical nature of this game helps to start the process of purging narcotics from their bodies.\nPeer pressure of team sport generates the determination that they need to stay out of the streets and transform their lives with this programme.\nAfter just 12 weeks of training, the physical condition and capacity of 39-year-old Marco had significantly improved.\nHe has reduced his level of LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol by 19%, increased his muscle mass by 2.4kg (5.2lbs) and has been assessed as having reduced his risk of developing a heart disease by at least 50%.\nThese statistics are important because the life of homeless male means they die 20 years before the average Danish male and are five times more likely to be hospitalised with traumatic injuries as the result of falls and fractures.\n\"When I started on the (football) project, I got a lot of energy. It opened some doors and all of the sudden I thought I wanted to have goals in life,\" recalls Marco.\n\"Now, I just want to live. I want to make it better for myself. It was a hard struggle but I'm here today.\"\nHe now has a steady job as a clerk in a Copenhagen church.\nPeter Fromm, a 34, is the goalkeeper of the Denmark's national homeless football team. He claims that football cured his addiction and took him out of the streets when other traditional rehabilitation methods failed.\n\"There's a lot of social networking with people who are on the same road as me to stay away from substances. It gives me some stability and helps me to build my self-esteem.\"\nThere's no doubt in the mind of Thomas Hye, founder of Ombold, a street football association that organises games, that this sport also has psychological benefits.\nCurrently, 20% of Denmark's 5.000 homeless take part in his event.\nMr Hye says: \"It's about joy and to be part of something together with other people. And losing without losing your head and feeling happy because you score a goal, and try to do better next time.\n\"Some of our players have anger management problems; they have a lot of conflicts with society.\n\"On the pitch they might think the referee is an idiot, but in football they learn they can cope with things.\n\"Football helps people to more than they think they can do. It helps people get off drugs because of the adrenaline in the body.\"\nMr Hye and Prof Krustrup belief that other countries should establish football leagues for people who live on the streets.\n\"Society has got a responsibility towards the homeless and socially disadvantaged,\" says Prof Krustrup.\n\"And football is an easy solution. All you need is a ball and two goals. The effects are rapid and marked in relation to health profile and well-being.\"\nProf Krustrup has carried out similar studies on other social groups, such as the elderly and has concluded that football is perhaps the best form of physical activity of all.\nHis advice is to stop watching the game on television and to get out and play.\nAnother group who play regularly is a team of Greenlandic women who spend much of their days outside the Sundholm hostel in Copenhagen's Amager district.\nThey spend no more than half an hour on the pitch. But their joy for participating is transparent. No incentives are required to induce them to put down the beer cans.\nAt the end of the session they spontaneously break into a chant of 'Sundholm United.'\n\"I love football,\" says Katava as a smile breaks across her deeply lined face. And then she catches the bus back 'home'.\nAround 20% of all those who join Denmark's street football league drop out.\nThe beautiful game doesn't always save, but at least it gets some of the rebounds.", "summary": "A project in Denmark is encouraging homeless people to get off the streets and onto the football pitch - with dramatic results.", "id": "28681372", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

He is learning to move a lot better coming forward into the net and that has added another dimension to his game.\n\"But we saw in the 2005 final against Andy Roddick how Federer was able to beat heavy firepower.\"\nArguably the greatest player of all time is staring back at you from across the net.

At his very best, his sliced backhand and how he was able to change pace was key.\n\"It will still be key in this year's semi-final because Raonic will be trying to hit ball as hard as he can.\n\"It is about whether Roger can block those balls and then use his net game with his sliced backhand to be effective.\"", "summary": "Roger Federer's longevity is down to the seven-time Wimbledon champion loving tennis more than any other player in history, says John McEnroe.", "id": "36736467", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nFederer is the greatest player of all time.\nFederer is the greatest player of all time.

I think for the world\".\nEarly data started to come back from instruments, and one team could see that the lander had sunk about 4cm (1.5 inches) into the surface, suggesting a relatively soft top layer.\nBut shortly after, engineers could see that the harpoons, designed to fasten the spacecraft to the 4km-wide (2.5 miles) ball of ice and dust, had not fired as planned.\nMission facts:\nPhilae lander\nComet 67P\nCan you land on a comet?\n'More black swan than yellow duck'\nBrief encounters with comets\nIn a later media briefing, Dr Ulamec said: \"What we know is we touched down, we landed at the comet at the time when you all saw us cheering and when it was announced.\n\"We had a very clear signal there; we received data from the landing - housekeeping and science data. That's the good news.\"\nBut then Dr Ulamec delivered the \"bad news\". He said telemetry from the craft suggested it might have drifted off the surface after landing and started to turn. This subsequently came to an end, which the German Space Agency official interpreted as a possible \"second landing\" on Comet 67P.\nIn fact, even later data would indicate that the Philae robot may have bounced twice, taking a full two hours to come to a rest.\nThis bouncing was always a possibility, but had been made more likely by the failure of the harpoons to deploy, and the failure of a thruster intended to push the robot into the surface.\nPictures from the surface have been retrieved at Earth and are being processed in preparation for release.\nScientists were initially elated following the confirmation of a landing.\nCanadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, famous for performing David Bowie's Space Oddity on the space station, said of the comet: \"Now we're close enough to lick it, and see what it's really made of.\"\nProf Monica Grady of the UK's Open University, who has worked on the project from its earliest days, was jumping for joy at Darmstadt when the news came through.\nShe told BBC News: \"I can't believe it, it's fantastic, we've landed - we've waited so long for this.\"\nBut the news about the unanchored state of Philae has cast a shadow over the celebrations.\nThe mission team must decide if the harpoons can now be commanded to fire without unsteadying the robot still further.\nEsa's Rosetta satellite, which had carried Philae on a 10-year, 6.4-billion-km journey to the comet, and which relayed its communications to Earth throughout the descent, has now moved out of radio \"visibility\".\nIf this connection is re-established on cue on Thursday, the team will feel much more confident.\nWhat is clear is that Philae touched down very close to the targeted zone on the head of the rubber-duck-shaped comet.\nPaolo Ferri, head of operations at Esa, said: \"The camera teams used [descent] images to show that we landed very, very close to the planned centre of our big error ellipse. And I think some people already have the co-ordinates of the first landing.\"\nIf Philae remains stable and can be properly secured, it will engage in several months of science experiments on 67P.\nIt will take pictures of the cometscape and analyse the surface chemical composition.\nScientists are hoping 67P's surface materials will hold fresh insights into the origins of our Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\nOne theory holds that comets were responsible for delivering water to the planets. Another idea is that they could have \"seeded\" the Earth with the chemistry needed to help kick-start life.

It takes time to create things.\n\"It's our first year in the Premiership, Aberavon are an experienced Premiership side and they've been there for donkey's years.\n\"We'll turn up at the weekend, we'll be prepared and we'll just give it our best shot, and hopefully that will be enough.\"", "summary": "Should Merthyr win the Principality Premiership final on Sunday at the first attempt, it will complete a dramatic rise in fortunes for the club.", "id": "39962082", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "Merthyr RFC are a Welsh rugby union club based in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.

some early 1970s computer science papers, which highlight how much the subject has changed over the intervening period.\nBack then, schools offering computer science A-level had to prove they had access to a computer, according to a syllabus from the time.\nIn 1970 computers were a rarity and pupils would have to visit machines in nearby universities or businesses, said AQA's computing qualifications manager Steven Kenny, because the cost of a school owning one was \"prohibitive\".\n\"They cost tens of thousands of pounds and were filing cabinet sized,\" he explained.\nStudents would write programmes in longhand and if they were lucky, their school would have the facilities to punch the code on to paper tapes.\nOtherwise the longhand notes would have to be sent off to be converted on to tape.\nThe students would then take the code with them when they visited the computer.\n\"They would spool the paper on to the computer and the code would appear on the screen if they had got it right. If it was wrong they would get an error message,\" said Mr Kenny.\nThis meant they would have to take it back to school, work out was wrong and correct it, he explained.\n\"It was often the same even at universities in those days.\"\nKevin Murrell, co-founder of The National Museum of Computing, said even a comma or a full stop out of place could mean a programme would fail once it was put into the computer.\nHe described himself as \"mortified\" by the difficulty of the mathematics required by the 1971 A-level.\nWhen he showed the paper to his staff, they \"went white as a sheet\", he told the BBC.\nThe paper required candidates to break everything down into binary or \"machine code\", which is \"very hard work and not something that anyone would be asked to do today\" he said.\n\"We write in languages that are akin to English which are converted into binary by the machine. For 99.9% of programmers, maths isn't an issue at all because modern computers do so much more.\"\nIn the 1970s machines were slow and students' access was so limited they had to be very precise about the programmes they wrote.\nToday's programmers can afford to be less precise as \"the sheer brute force of modern computers gets you through\".\nMr Murrell did O-level computer science in 1976 using a keyboard and printer connected by phone to an Open University computer.\n\"You would key in your programme and it would run remotely at the OU. I can't tell you how exciting that was!\"\nThe price of computers gradually dropped with a Research Machines computer costing around \u00c2\u00a33,000 by the mid 1970s and a Commodore PET around \u00c2\u00a31,000 after that.\nAnother generation of coders learned their craft on machines like the Sinclair Spectrum and the BBC Micro which appeared in the early 1980s.\nMr Kenny remembers the arrival of a computer at his inner city comprehensive school in 1979.\n\"Pupils had very limited access - only a few were allowed to use it.\"\nAll this had an effect on the exam questions.\n\"Because people didn't have access to computers, a lot of it had to be focused on theory.\n\"There was a big focus on logical and computational thinking, using flow charts and algorithms to break instructions down into the smallest logical steps for a computer to follow.\n\"The difference now is that there is a lot more creativity involved: for example designing apps for use in daily life.\"\nHowever, one surprise was how many of the questions are still relevant, said Mr Kenny.\n\"About half the questions could probably be put into an A-level paper today with a bit more context.\"\nThe big differences were in questions focused on the practical use of computers - some of which now seem quaint.\nFor example candidates were asked to \"Write an essay on the use of computers in one of the following (a) airlines (b) banking (c) local government or (d) wholesale trade\".\nAnother question required them to prepare a flow chart to record 12,000 ticket sales between four destinations on the same railway line over a 30-day period.\n\"We wouldn't phrase this the same way or use the same example but some of the same processes would be needed by programmers today,\" said Mr Murrell.\nMr Kenny suggested today's equivalent question would be about \"the internet of things\", where, for example, a computerised fridge can detect when groceries are running low and order a delivery without the householder being involved.\nBy the early 1980s people began to buy home computers and Mr Kenny admitted his younger self used to wonder why people would use them.\n\"They would have been game-players or enthusiastic coders - much more geeky than now,\" he suggests before adding that some people might have used them for \"numbers and data\", particularly home finances.\nHe adds: \"It's easy for us to answer that question today because computers are everywhere.

at the time the biggest sovereign debt default in history.\nHe began a process of restructuring the debt that had been defaulted on.\nIn 2005, a majority of creditors agreed to swap their bonds for new ones that left them with little more than 30 cents on the dollar.\nA second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of renegotiated bonds to 93%.\nThe remaining 7% refused a deal and became known as the holdouts.\nWhile even critics of Kirchnerism recognise the importance of the debt restructuring deals, some bemoan the government's failure to settle the long-running $1.3bn dispute with the holdouts, which has locked Argentina out of capital markets for a decade.\nRead also: Argentina in denial over debt dispute\nThe opposition blames the Kirchners for rising inflation, lowering purchasing power and stagnant growth.\nSince Argentina is cut off from borrowing on international capital markets, the government imposed strict currency and capital controls to avoid capital flight.\nThe amount of dollars available at the official rate is limited but demand remains high, leading to a soaring black market and an overvalued currency.\nGovernment officials estimated that inflation would hit 14.4% this year, but independent economist predicted almost double that: 25% annually.\nAs inflation rises, the peso has increasingly less purchasing power.\nThe price of some basic goods has been stabilised thanks to an agreement between the national government and local businesses.\nBut critics say this only distorts the economy further.\nRead also: Argentina vote poses economic choice\nWhen it comes to the justice system, the Kirchners' legacy is highly divisive.\nSupporters highlight the government's decision to overturn amnesty laws which protected lower-ranking members of the military from prosecution for crimes committed during Argentina's military rule from 1976 to 1983.\nOne thousand former members of the military have been charged thanks to this change in the law.\nBut critics accuse the Kirchners of co-opting the justice system, slowing down and obstructing any investigation that could affect the government, from corruption charges involving Vice-President Amado Boudou to the death in mysterious circumstance of prosecutor Alberto Nisman.\nOver the past 12 years, the Kirchners re-nationalised many companies which had been privatised during the 1990s.\nArgentina's postal service, its radio spectrum and Buenos Aires's water company were nationalised early on under Nestor Kirchner.\nCristina Fernandez de Kirchner drove the re-nationalisation of arguably the four most important companies: national carrier Aerolineas Argentinas, oil company YPF, Argentina's railway system and its pension fund.\nWhile some celebrate these as an important reassertion of state control in the economy, critics complain of inefficiency and of government interference.\nIn 2010, Argentina became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex marriage.\nThe law gave gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals, including adoption and inheritance rights.\nIn 2012, parliament approved a \"gender identity law\", which allowed for changes to be made to people's gender, image, or birth name on civil registries.\nHowever, discrimination and violence against transgender people remains high.\nThree transgender people have been killed in recent weeks.\nLeft-wing critics say the government has not been progressive enough to legalise abortion or the sale and consumption of marijuana, as neighbouring Uruguay has.", "summary": "Whatever the result of Sunday's run-off election in Argentina, it represents the end of an era.", "id": "34580287", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Kirchners have been in power for 12 years.\nThe Kirchners have been in power for 12 years.

In what was a first day of 'proper' Test cricket, he played a proper Test innings.\nI was actually quite surprised by the way England reacted to that 340-run hammering at Trent Bridge. They were bang to rights but, rather than holding their hands up, they tried to counter the criticism.\nThe message they should have taken was a reminder that in Test cricket you cannot always play freely and expect it to work all the time. You will get bitten.\nIn reality, the men most likely to show how it is supposed to be done were Cook and Joe Root, with Cook the one rising to the challenge of a magnificent South Africa attack in tricky conditions.\nHaving said that, all of England's batsmen fought hard, with Cook's 82 not out taking them to 171-4 on a rain-hit day.\nEarly on, the opener played a fluent drive that made me think, 'he's in good touch today'. It's always a positive sign when Cook is getting forward and driving straight.\nHe is one of England's most prolific run-scorers, so he knows how to play, but there was also an element of giving the rest an example to follow after the feeble batting we saw in Nottingham.\nCook batted deep in his crease, possibly to counter the bounce, and left the ball well, often when he knew it was going over the top of the stumps.\nStill, when South Africa got it right, they bowled brilliantly, probing as the ball both swung and moved off the pitch.\nFor that reason, Cook can look back on what he has achieved today with immense pride. It wasn't pretty, but it was hugely satisfying.\nWhile Cook batted throughout the day, his opening partner, Keaton Jennings, lasted only nine deliveries before falling for what is his third duck in five Tests.\nIndeed, after making a century on his debut and following that with 54 in his second match, Jennings has made scores of 8, 33, 0, 3 and 0.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLike at Trent Bridge, when he got bowled through the gate by Vernon Philander, his technique let him down.\nNow, I do not know if the habit he has of planting the front foot and pushing at the ball is the way he plays all the time, or just something he is doing because he is out of form.\nBut I can say with certainty that, unless he changes, he will be found out at this level.\nIf he is not offering a huge gap between bat and pad for the ball to travel through, then he is susceptible to giving an edge, like he did on the first morning here.\nIn some ways, I feel sorry for him, because he is being thrust out to open the batting after only being given a diet of Division Two bowling in the County Championship - and even then he hasn't made many runs for Durham.\nRemember, Haseeb Hameed, England's other success story from the winter, was left out because of his domestic form.\nBut that doesn't stop me fearing for Jennings, who now faces a big second innings and fourth Test at Old Trafford next week.\nHe is likely to be given every chance to succeed - coach Trevor Bayliss has stated in the past that he would rather give a player one game too many than one game too few. Indeed, it's my understanding that England would have retained Gary Ballance for this Test had he not broken a finger.\nBallance's replacement at number three, Tom Westley, showed signs of promise in his 25.\nHe reminded me of John Crawley, formerly of England, Lancashire and Hampshire, with the way he whipped the ball through mid-wicket using his bottom hand.\nThe right-hander stood tall, followed Cook's example to leave well and showed good judgement.\nWestley may have to straighten his technique - he was slightly turned around giving the edge that led to his dismissal - but, for a first knock in difficult circumstance, it was OK.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHis fellow debutant Dawid Malan got a much more brutal introduction to Test cricket, probably answering any questions that he may have had about just how hard the game is at this level.\nHe took 15 balls to get off the mark, which can't have happened very often when he has been playing for Middlesex, and then got bowled by a wonderful yorker from Kagiso Rabada.\nIt was a fantastic piece of bowling, with pace and swing leaving Malan on the turf.\nIf the batsman can take any crumb of comfort, it is that ball would have got pretty much everyone out.\nIt was deliveries like that, and those produced by Philander and Morne Morkel, which give further credit to the innings played by Cook.\nHe dug deep and enjoyed the challenge.

There are a few different ways to score points:\nTry: A try is worth five points. It is scored when a player places the ball on the ground with downward pressure, between the try line and dead ball line of the opposition's half of the pitch.\nThere is no such thing as an \"own try\". If you touch the ball down in your own in-goal area, it results in a kick or a scrum.\nConversion: If a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to \"convert\" it for two further points by kicking the ball through the goal. The kick is taken from a point level with where the try was scored.\nPenalty kick: If a side commits a foul or serious offence, a penalty is awarded and the opposition can decide to kick the ball through the goal posts from where the offence happened. If successful, it is worth three points.\nDrop goal: A drop goal is also worth three points and is scored when a player kicks the ball from out of their hands through the opposition's goal. But the ball must touch the ground between being dropped and kicked.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE: \"Great try boys! Now let's add the conversion.\"\nKEY WORDS\nScrum - A scrum is when eight forwards from one team push against eight forwards from the opposing team. One player feeds the ball into the middle of the scrum and the two sides then push to try and take control of the ball.\nIt's used to as a way of restarting the game and can be one of the key areas that help a team win.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE: \"That's a messy scrum, they're all over the place.\"\nHooker - A key player in the scrum - their job is to hook the ball back towards the rest of their team using their feet.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE:\"This guy can't hook for toffee.\" (if their team keeps losing the scrum)\nFly-half - Some people think that the fly-half is the most important player on the pitch.\nHe is normally the best kicker and is in charge of calling plays and controlling where his team go, where they're running and where the ball goes.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE: \"He's no Jonny Wilkinson that fly-half.\"\nTurnover - A turnover is when one side is attacking and the other team take the ball off them.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE:\"They've done well to force the turnover.\"\nRuck - When a tackled player hits the ground he must let go of the ball. If neither team then picks it up they can start pushing against each other with the ball still on the ground. This is what's known as a ruck.\nTeams can push the other back great distances while the ball is in the ruck. However, if it stops moving the referee may blow his whistle and restart the game with a scrum.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE: \"They need more people in the ruck.\"\nSin-bin - All players who have committed a yellow card offence have to leave the game for 10 minutes and sit on a bench called the sin-bin.\nUnlike football, anyone the ref shows a yellow card must leave the pitch straight away, but can come back after their 10-minute punishment runs out.\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE: (After a bad tackle) \"He should go to the sin-bin for that.\"\nHere's some other things you might hear a lot:\nLineout: When the ball goes out of play at the side of the pitch, a lineout is awarded against the team who last touched the ball.  Players from each team line up in a long row and the ball is thrown into this line up by the hooker. Both sides jump to try to get the ball, and can lift each other up to reach it.\nKnock-on/knock-forward: This is when the ball goes forward off the hands or arms of a player and hits the ground or another player. You are not allowed to throw the ball forward in rugby and so if there is a knock on the other team are awarded a scrum.\nForward pass: The ball always has to be passed backwards in rugby. If the referee thinks it is passed forward then a scrum is awarded to the other side.\nHigh tackle: It is illegal to tackle an opponent above the shoulders. The same goes for the late tackle - tackling the player after he has passed or kicked the ball.", "summary": "The Rugby World Cup is kicking off and over the next few weeks you're going to be hearing about it a lot.", "id": "34292060", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nBLUFFER'S PHRASE: \"He's got a high tackle there.\"\nRuck: When a tackled player hits the ground he must let go of the ball.

Does she say yes?\nThe cast kept tight lipped, but Kaley Cuoco did admit she started crying behind the camera when the scene was being filmed.\n\"We were all crying!\" Kunal Nayyar said, with Johnny Galecki adding: \"I came as close to crying as is possible for me.\"\nAfter a sombre start with a tribute to stuntman John Bernecker, who died last week while filming on set, the cast became more light-hearted answering fan questions.\nJeffrey Dean Morgan - aka Negan - revealed the thing he liked least about his character was wearing a leather jacket in 120-degree heat; everyone took the mickey out of Andrew Lincoln for his pronunciation of \"Carl\"; and the cast reminisced over the past 100 episodes.\nBut the big talking point was the five-minute trailer for season eight which was played to fans and then released online.\nGame of Thrones panels aren't known to be particularly revealing as the cast are always sworn to secrecy.\nThis year was no different, so Alfie Allen bringing his puppy on stage with him was one of the highlights - as was Kristian Nairn, better known as Hodor, hosting the panel.\nSadly Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke didn't make an appearance, but fans seemed happy with the cast present for the Q&A.\nAlthough Gwendoline Christie was asked a rather awkward question.\nThe Twin Peaks revival made its Comic-Con debut this year to an appreciative crowd.\nDavid Lynch sent a bizarre video message in a way only he could, featuring the sounds of a man apparently falling to his death, a whining horse, references to OJ Simpson and the director himself shouting randomly at people off camera.\nBut during the panel, cast members Matthew Lillard and Tim Roth revealed they had never watched the original Twin Peaks series.\n\"I'm going to wait until it's done and watch everything from the first series [and the new episodes], all the way through, with my kids. I don't know what that's going to do to us,\" Roth said.\nThe best bit of the Q&A was when an audience member who had never seen Twin Peaks asked the cast to describe it in a nutshell. \"Just throw away the nut!\" MacLachlan said, with Watts adding: \"Keep the shell.\"\nNew X-Men universe TV series The Gifted introduced its stars of the show, including former True Blood actor Stephen Moyer and ex-Angel star Amy Acker.\nIt tells the story of a suburban couple who are forced underground after the sudden discovery that their children possess mutant powers.\nBrought to screen by Bryan Singer, who directed X-Men on the big screen, existing mutants from the comics appear in the series including Thunderbird, Polaris, Blink, and Eclipse, although some of the more famous ones won't feature.\n\"It's not just that they're too expensive for television, but that may be related,\" executive producer Matt Nix joked.\nFans were shown the opening 15 minutes of the first episode, along with an extended trailer which was also released online.\nThe cast of Preacher, along with Seth Rogen - who adapted the comic and brought it to screens - gave a typically outrageous panel in line with the tone of the show.\nWhen asked if he had ever thought a show as violent and inappropriate like Preacher would exist on TV, Rogen replied: \"It's lucky for us people's sensibilities have declined in recent years... We live in an age of decline and are able to contribute to that decline - it's a childhood dream come true.\"\nRogen also teased he might appear in the series himself one day, although wouldn't say when and joked: \"I don't want to say it, but I'm going to replace Dominic with myself. The show is called Rabbi now.\"\nSci-fi royalty Sigourney Weaver was on hand at the panel for The Defenders - Netflix's mash-up Marvel series which brings together the four heroes who already have their own shows: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist.\nWeaver said she was such a fan of the first two heroes she couldn't refuse a part.\nFans were treated to the entire first episode, as well as news Iron First had been renewed for a second series.\nFormer Walking Dead star Jon Bernthal also made a surprise appearance to introduce a new clip from his series, The Punisher.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

[England centre] Manu Tuilagi, who has hardly played on the tour, has made it on the bench in front of him and that is a huge call by Gatland.\n\"You pick your best team and if he thinks the best team is playing Jamie Roberts with Jonathan Davies, who know each other so very well, then so be it.\n\"But it's a big call to bring Roberts back, he has to come back in the side but let's hope he's 100% fit - picking Tuilagi on the bench says to me that they're having him as cover in case Jamie breaks down.\"\nThe decision by Gatland - who is also the Wales coach - to select 10 Wales players equals the record for the number of Welshmen in a Lions starting XV set in the first Test against Australia in 1950.\nThe record for the number of players from a single country is 12, when a dozen Englishman started for the Lions in the late 1880s, while in the modern era 11 Englishmen started the second Test win over New Zealand in 1993.\nLions won the first Test of the current tour 23-21 in Brisbane but the Wallabies squared the three-Test series by winning 16-15 in Melbourne last weekend, setting up a grand finale in Sydney on Saturday.\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game everything's fine',\" added Bennett.\n\"I tell you what, there's 10 Welshman in on Saturday. If we lose that game against Australia they will come round from everywhere from the other three countries and say, 'hang on, Wales haven't beaten Australia for years, why did they pick they pick so many Welshmen?'.\n\"So it's win or bust for Gatland on Saturday.\n\"You have to look at winning the Test series. We've got a captain in Alun Wyn Jones who has been the best forward on the whole tour, outstanding, closely pursued by [injured skipper] Sam Warburton.\n\"So I think it's a bold decision who plays, he's [Gatland] laid his cards on the table, had to bring [hooker] Richard Hibbard back in - a Welshman.\n\"If I'm being perfectly frank with myself and everybody else I would have looked at even bringing [lock] Ian Evans back instead of Geoff Parling, who I thought was lightweight last Saturday.\n\"At the end of the day, he [Gatland] will be judged on the winning or losing of the game and if we lose this match on Saturday, all the critics of the other three countries will say he put all his faith into the power game - big men, no flair, no skill, no O'Driscoll etc.\n\"He's on a hiding to nothing but he's very bold, but he desperately needs a win for his own reputation on Saturday.\"", "summary": "British and Irish Lions great Phil Bennett fears the team selected for Saturday's deciding Test against Australia has caused divisions.", "id": "23157738", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not saying it's a bad team, I'm saying it's a bold team.\n\"I'm not saying it's a bad team, I'm saying it's a bold team.", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not saying it's a bad team, I'm saying it's a bold team.\n\"I'm not saying it's a bad team, I'm saying it's a bold team.", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_2": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not saying it's a bad team, I'm saying it's a bold team, it's a team that's going to be judged on the result of the game.\n\"If we lose", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_2": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_3": "\n\"I've heard it on Lions tour before, 'oh, we don't care if there's 10 Englishmen in the side, 10 Scotsmen or whatever, as long as we win the game", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_3": "\n\"I'm not saying it's a bad team, I'm saying it's a bold team.

Australia's economic growth during difficult global financial times should have played well for an incumbent government. But the economy has begun to slow and Kevin Rudd's Labor party has been  undone by disunity and infighting. The rivalry between Mr Rudd and Julia Gillard which saw the leadership of the party and the country switch back  and forth did not sit well with voters.\nYou sense  from voters that Mr Abbott's victory is not so much a ringing endorsement as a rejection of  Labor. He's a conservative who has promised a tough line on immigration and asylum-seekers. He opposes gay marriage and has been a sceptic on climate      change. Kevin Rudd sold himself as the comeback kid. It didn't work. His  party now faces a period of further introspection.\nAustralia largely avoided the recession that hit the UK and other Western nations thanks to a natural resources boom.\nBut the boom is coming to an end, and Mr Abbott will be charged with managing the transition.\nAhead of the polls, his coalition highlighted bitter Labor infighting, seeking to portray itself as the more stable party.\nAnd former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the internal divisions for Labor's defeat.\n\"I really believe this was an election that was lost by the government rather than one that was won by the opposition,\" he said.\nJulia Gillard, meanwhile, congratulated the Labor candidate who succeeded her in her seat, as she bowed out of politics.\nThe outsider candidates had mixed fortunes at the polls.\nOne of the two undecided seats in the House sees billionaire Clive Palmer, famous for his attempt to build a new version of the Titanic based on the original designs, on course for victory.\nHowever, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange missed out on a Senate seat in Victoria, where the final place was claimed by Rick Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party.\nMore than 14 million people were registered to vote in Saturday's election.

These two things are not like each other.\n\"So the ability to focus and engage with customers on a narrow set of objectives and business outcomes... I can already see the difference,\" she says.\nOne big change, she says, is it allows each of the divisions to pursue the strategy that is right for them.\nFor example, she says there is \"no way\" printer and PC company HP Inc's decision last year to buy Samsung's printing business for $1bn would have happened when it was part of the larger firm.\n\"We would have allocated a billion dollars for a cloud or big data analytics or the next generation of software to find infrastructure. So it's that ability to drive your own agenda, not hindered by other businesses that don't have the same characteristics [which is the advantage],\" she says.\nMs Whitman is so convinced her strategy is working that she's shrunk HPE further, spinning off both its business services division and its software business into separate companies last year.\nHer assumption that bigger doesn't always mean better seems surprising.\nAfter all, a larger company should find it easier to dominate the market it operates in.\nBut the rapid rise of much smaller start-ups, rivalling and often overtaking these established behemoths means the accepted wisdom that size equals success is being challenged, and not just by HPE.\nFor example, media firms News Corporation and Time Warner have both split off their print businesses into separate firms, aiming to accelerate the growth of their broadcast arms.\nSimilarly in 2014, eBay - also formerly led by Ms Whitman - split into two, carving PayPal, the electronic payments arm it bought in 2001, off from the main online auction business.\nCEO coach and author Steve Tappin says such moves reflect a shift in management thinking.\n\"For a long time, growing big seemed best in business, with great scale giving great buying power. Today, things are different - large enterprises are often too slow, and are overtaken by smaller disruptive firms.\"\nBox is a case in point. The cloud storage company, which allows users to upload files and access them no matter where they are or on what device, was founded in 2005.\nFounder Aaron Levie says the product - which doesn't require users to install or download any software - was \" inadvertently very disruptive to the traditional technology companies\".\n\"Whether [you're] Uber, Airbnb, Spotify or Netflix - those same lessons apply. Which is if you can build something that's cheaper, faster and more scalable and delivers a far better customer experience than what the traditional vendors or incumbents were able to do, then you can be extremely disruptive,\" he says.\nThe firm now employs 1,400 people, but Mr Levie says it still aims to behave in the same way as it did when it had just 20 staff members to keep its entrepreneurial mindset.\nIt is something Ms Whitman is also trying to achieve at HPE.\n\"The bigger you are the harder it is to be fast, because you've got so many people involved in every decision. Our view was - given the backdrop of the technology industry - [being] smaller [and] more focused was going to be important,\" she says.\nThis feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin, and by series producer Neil Koenig, for the BBC's CEO Guru series.", "summary": "\"The future belongs to the fast,\" is how Meg Whitman explains her radical decision as chief executive to split up technology giant Hewlett-Packard.", "id": "39116672", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\"HPE's Meg Whitman: The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "\"The firm, which famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and which is credited with founding Silicon Valley - the beating heart of the hi-tech world - has now", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "the BBC's CEO Guru series.

Their families have been told.\nIt is the biggest single loss of UK life at one time in Afghanistan since a Nimrod crash killed 14 in 2006.\nThe explosion is thought to have been caused by a very large Taliban bomb.\nThe number of British military deaths in Afghanistan since 2001 is now 404.\nBy Caroline WyattDefence correspondent, BBC News\nThis is the worst single loss of life in one incident due to enemy action for UK troops in Afghanistan since the start of the war in 2001.\nThe last time a similar number of UK casualties was caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) was in the summer of 2009, when five British soldiers died in an IED blast.\nThe device remains the deadliest weapon in the Taliban's arsenal. It is effective on a psychological level, as well as causing deaths and severe injury, and is relatively cheap and simple to manufacture.\nThe level of suspected casualties suggests a large amount of explosives were used.\nMore from Caroline Wyatt\nPrime Minister David Cameron said it was a \"desperately sad day for our country\".\n\"Every death and every injury reminds us of the human cost paid by our armed forces to keep our country safe,\" he said, at the start of Prime Minister's Questions.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Defence (MoD)said the six soldiers were on a security patrol in a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle when it was caught in an explosion in Kandahar province.\nBrig Patrick Sanders, commander of Task Force Helmand, said it suffered \"catastrophic damage\".\nThey had been travelling as part of a two Warrior patrol when the vehicle was hit at the junction of a road travelling east from Gereshk and another heading north to Lashkar Gah, the MoD said.\nThe BBC's Orla Guerin, in the Afghan capital Kabul, said there must have been a \"massive explosion\" to damage such a robust and heavily protected vehicle.\nThe area, she said, was sparsely populated and particularly unstable, according to Afghan officials, and insurgents were known to have planted roadside bombs there.\nThe BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul said a police official in Lashkar Gah named IEDs as the biggest threat to his forces and told him insurgents were now planting them on key roads in a clear change of tactics.\nMeanwhile, BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the six soldiers had been in the country for less than a month, having flown out of the UK on Valentine's Day.\nShe added that the ongoing operation to recover the bodies would have been slowed down as rescuers would have faced the risk of being injured themselves by further bombs.\nNews emerged earlier on Wednesday that the six were missing, presumed dead. It is understood the MoD has not formally identified them.\nMost of the 9,500 UK troops in Afghanistan are expected to be withdrawn by the end of 2014, when 13 years of combat operations in the country are set to cease.\nDefence Secretary Philip Hammond said the timetable for withdrawal remained on track despite this \"cowardly attack\".\n\"This will not shake our resolve to see through the mission - I believe we owe that to all the brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives and put themselves at risk over the last few years,\" he told the BBC.\nIn the Commons, Mr Cameron told MPs \"every possible support\" had to be given to a political settlement in Afghanistan.\nHe said a clear message had to be sent to the Taliban that - whether UK troops or Afghan troops were there - they \"will not win on the battlefield - they never win on the battlefield\".\nMr Cameron said he had spoken to the UK's leading military officers, who had stressed the commitment of troops to \"getting the job done\".\nHe also said he would discuss the Afghanistan situation with President Barack Obama on his visit to the US next week to ensure they were \"in lock step\" about the importance of training up the Afghan army and police, and making sure all Nato partners had a properly co-ordinated process for transition.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband expressed his \"profound sadness\" over the latest deaths and said the UK owed those who put themselves in harm's way for our benefit \"an immense debt of gratitude\".\nChief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news.\n\"The courage, fortitude and determination of those servicemen and women currently in Helmand is inspirational,\" he said.\nThe Archbishop of York John Sentamu said his heart went out to those affected, and we owed a debt of gratitude to our \"brave soldiers\".\nThe last British soldier to be killed in Afghanistan was Senior Aircraftman Ryan Tomlin, of 2

This suggests that it also has the potential to cause cancer in humans.\nThe FSA has used that data and multiple dietary surveys to work out whether an average person's exposure to acrylamide in food is a concern.\nScientists believe that there should be a margin of exposure of 10,000 or higher between an average adult's intake of acrylamide and the lowest dose which could cause adverse effects.\nBut at the moment the numbers are 425 for the average adult and 50 for the highest consuming toddlers, making it a slight public health concern, UK and European food safety experts say.\nHowever, Cambridge University risk expert Prof David Spiegelhalter is unconvinced by this very strict safety standard.\nHe says the margin of exposure figure is \"arbitrary\" and 33 times higher than the current margin for average adults in the UK, and he questions whether a public campaign should be launched on that basis.\nStopping smoking is the most important thing you can do to prevent cancer.\nKeeping a healthy bodyweight and eating a balanced diet ranks second.\nOur individual risk of cancer depends on a combination of genes, our environment and the lifestyle we lead, which we are able to control.\nThe amount of acrylamide in our diets is one small element of our food intake which we can control to help reduce our risk of cancer during the whole of our lives.\nResearch has shown that eating too much processed meat and red meat can increase the risk of developing cancer - that is a definite.\nCooking meat at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing can produce cancer-causing chemicals called heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic amines (PCAs).\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.\nA toolkit and brochures have been produced for food manufacturers and food businesses, giving information and advice.\nEvidence suggests the industry has been lowering levels of acrylamide in food over the past few years.\nBut there are currently no rules on the maximum limits for the chemical in food.\nIt is their job to make sure the food we eat is safe and to let the public know if they are concerned about any risk to our health.\nThis is not a new risk - people are likely to have been exposed to it since fire was first invented.\nA Swedish study in 2002 was the first to reveal that high levels of acrylamide formed during the baking or frying of potato and cereal products.\nAnd since then researchers have been trying to make sure the risks from the chemical are kept to a minimum.\nInfants and toddlers are more at risk of exposure because of their smaller body weight, and their high intake of cereal-based foods.\nBasically, the advice is another reason to eat a healthy, balanced diet - and make sure your children do too.", "summary": "Advice on how to reduce the amount of acrylamide in our diets has been issued by the government's food safety body, because the chemical could cause cancer.", "id": "38691915", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.\"\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"The FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.\"\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\"The FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.\"\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.\"\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\"The FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.\"\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued advice to the public on how to reduce their exposure to acrylamide, a chemical found in some foods.\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nThe FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food.

So how did events unfold over the last seven days?\nA 47-count indictment against nine Fifa officials and five corporate executives is unsealed before a court in Brooklyn.\nThe US justice department says the men were under investigation worldwide for allegedly accepting bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (\u00c2\u00a397m) over a 24-year period.\nA series of arrests are carried out at the luxury Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich, where Fifa officials are staying. Mr Blatter is not one of those detained. More arrests are expected, the journalist who broke the story tells the BBC.\nThe office of Switzerland's Attorney General confirms it has opened an investigation into suspected \"criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 Football World Cups\" in Russia and Qatar.\nIt says documents and electronic data have been seized from Fifa's headquarters in Zurich.\nFifa spokesman Walter De Gregorio says the election of Fifa's president will still take place two days later. \"The stress factor is a bit higher today,\" he adds.\nAt a press conference, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch details the extent of alleged corruption by Fifa officials.

But, he says, he is not able to \"monitor everyone all of the time\".\nFootball sponsors start to express their concerns about the scandals surrounding Fifa.\nDespite mounting pressure, Fifa's presidential election goes ahead.\nMr Blatter's only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, withdraws from the race after winning 73 votes to Mr Blatter's 133 in the election's first round. The 79-year-old is re-elected.\nMr Blatter - who has vowed to make this the last of his five terms - says: \"I am the president now, the president of everybody.\"\nEnglish Football Association chairman Greg Dyke again demands Mr Blatter stand down, and warns that the events of the last week \"are not all over\".\nFootball sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Adidas and McDonald's, all call for reform within Fifa.\nMr Blatter tells Swiss television: \"Why would I step down? That would mean I recognise that I did wrong.\"\nA day after his re-election, Mr Blatter downplays the US indictments, saying in an interview with the Swiss public broadcaster that there was a \"hate campaign\" against Fifa by European football nations.\nMr Blatter is also asked about another allegation made in the indictment. It states that a senior Fifa official authorised an alleged $10m (\u00c2\u00a36.5m) payment in exchange for votes in favour of South Africa hosting the 2010 World Cup.\n\"Definitely, that's not me,\" he says.\nSouth Africa denies the payment it made was a bribe, insisting it went to pay for football development for the African diaspora in the Caribbean.\nIn a BBC interview, Mr Blatter's daughter says her father is the victim of a conspiracy \"behind the scenes\" of world football.\nThe New York Times alleges that Mr Blatter's most senior aide at Fifa, Jerome Valcke, was the man who authorised the $10m payment.

It is now being termed an epidemic due to its geographical spread and the number of people infected.\nAn epidemic is the occurrence of a group of illnesses of similar nature and derived from a common source, in excess of what would be normally expected in a community or region. The Sars epidemic of 2003 is a classic example.\nEpidemics eventually spread out via means of long distance travel, migration of infected animals or aerosols.\nSometimes the speed of spread of disease determines whether it is classified as an outbreak or an epidemic. For example, the slow moving E.coli outbreak in 2011 in Western Europe in 2011 remained classified as an outbreak, even though many people were eventually affected over a wide area.\nA pandemic refers to a worldwide epidemic, which could have started off as an outbreak, escalated to the level of an epidemic and eventually spread to a number of countries across continents. The 2009 flu (H1N1) pandemic is the most recent in human history. Airborne organisms seem to have the highest pandemic potential.\nTwo things that indicate the seriousness of an infectious disease are the number of people affected or killed, and the geographical spread of the disease.\nHowever, no clear-cut number is assigned to any of these definitions.\nGovernment policy may influence the label given to a disease. For instance, labelling a disease as an epidemic or pandemic could lead to travel restrictions and affect trade (exports). It can have a major impact on the disease-affected country's economy.\nSometimes governments and authorities do not want to call an outbreak an epidemic simply to avoid panic.\nWhat are emerging and re-emerging diseases?\nAn emerging disease is one that has appeared in a population for the first time or one, which may have existed before, but is rapidly increasing in incidence.\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an example of an emerging disease. It appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but now there are reported cases in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe and North America.\nRe-emerging diseases are those that have historically infected humans, but continue to appear in new locations or reappear after apparent control or elimination.\nMost of the re-emerging disease agents appeared long ago and have survived and persisted in the environment.\nFor example, due to decline in vaccination against measles, the measles virus could re-emerge and affect a large number of individuals.\nThus it becomes important to continue vaccinating susceptible individuals against all bugs, which could re-emerge, unless the organism has been eradicated, for example smallpox.\nWhat are the most persistent endemic diseases and why?\nA disease is described as endemic when it is habitually present within a given geographic area.\nFor example, rotavirus diarrhoea is endemic in India, and Nipah virus, endemic in South-east Asia, more specifically Bangladesh.\nThere are several reasons why a disease could become endemic in a region.\nThe lack of vaccine or prophylactic treatment may enable the disease to linger.\nClimate and geographical location also plays an important role in the survival of a disease-causing organism.\nFor example, Dengue is more likely to become endemic in a tropical region, where mosquitoes and water-logging are common.\nThe presence of animal reservoirs is another factor that could cause a disease to become endemic.\nNon-human primates in Africa maintain the life cycle of yellow fever. This becomes a source of occasional spillover to humans and the disease remains in the area for a long time.\nThe presence of susceptible host and a low mortality rate may enable a disease-causing agent to become endemic.\nIf a virus kills a host, it has to look for another host to continue replicating.\nIf an affected region was cleared of susceptible individuals, by virtue of high mortality of the disease, the disease would die out eventually as well.\nFinally, the duration of time that a virus can remain active outside the host in the environment is also important.\nSome viruses such as HIV do not persist for long outside the host and are inactivated, whereas smallpox at room temperature could have remained infectious for years.", "summary": "The Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 8,000 people since February 2014 and it has spread beyond the three countries initially affected.", "id": "30712001", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1.

LiDAR is the system used for accurately detecting objects around the car.\nFord was also part of an investment round that raised $6.6m for Civil Maps - a digital mapping company - as well as money put towards neuroscience research.\nTellingly, there was no mention of Google or Apple in Ford\u2019s announcement - a suggestion it has opted to compete against the Silicon Valley giants rather than try and work with them as some had originally anticipated.\nBut Google still leads the way in self-driving technology - its cars have been out on public roads clocking up miles for several years now. It too is developing a car without a steering wheel - but regulations so far prevent that car from venturing beyond private land.\nLike Google, Ford said it would be focusing on \u201cLevel 4\u201d autonomy in reference to the standards put in place by the US-based Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).\nThe levels represent the sophistication of self-driving technology. At Level four - \u201chigh automation\u201d - the car is able to operate, unmonitored, in a particular use case. For Ford, the use case would be a city area. Level 5 would mean full autonomy in any driving condition.\nThe company said it was not interested in offering Level three driving. Level two means some level of automation that requires the driver to monitor the car at all times.\nIsolated Tesla\nTesla\u2019s Autopilot, which changes lanes and monitors traffic flow, is officially Level two - although critics say human nature means drivers are instinctively treating Autopilot as if it were in fact Level three automation. Level three is when constant monitoring is not required, but drivers should be ready to take control in emergencies. Tesla\u2019s technology is under investigation by US road safety regulators after it was blamed for causing the death of a driver earlier this year.\nTesla chief executive Elon Musk defended the roll-out of Autopilot in a recent blog post:\n\"When used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability,\" he wrote.\nAt its announcement, Ford chief technical officer Raj Nair said the company wasn\u2019t satisfied that drivers could safely take control from a level two or three vehicle at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how to manage hand over back to the driver and have him engage and have him situationally aware, and be able to do that in a safe aware manner,\u201d he said.\nThis approach chimes with the views of Google which in the past has expressed concern about the safety implications of semi-autonomous driving. It leaves Tesla, with Autopilot, isolated among auto makers.\n\"Tesla is unique in that it\u2019s allowing its users to be beta testers,\u201d said Wayne Cunningham, managing editor of motoring news website Road Show.\n\"No other company thinks that way.\"\nOn Ford\u2019s 2021 pledge, Mr Cunningham told the BBC it was a feasible goal but one that was intentionally narrow.\n\"It\u2019s not as an aggressive step as it sounds,\u201d he said.\n\"This is really a car designed for very specific urban environments. It\u2019s a car that\u2019s going to take people at 20-30 mph through city centres.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "summary": "Ford has said it will mass-produce a fully autonomous self-driving car without a steering wheel by 2021.", "id": "37103159", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nFord said this was most likely as part of", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nFord said this was most likely as part of", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nFord said this was most likely as part of", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nFord said this was most likely as part of", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nFord said this was most likely as part of", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nFord has announced it will have a fully autonomous car on the road by 2021.\nThe car will be able to drive itself in urban environments.\nFord is not interested in developing a car that can drive itself", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nFord has announced it will have a fully autonomous car on the road by 2021.\nThe car will be able to drive itself in urban environments.\nFord is the first major car maker to announce a", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a self-driving car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nIt said this was most likely as part", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nFord has announced a bold plan to have a fully autonomous car on the road by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\nFord has announced it will be investing $1bn in a new autonomous vehicle division.\nThe company said it would be focusing on \u201cLevel 4\u201d autonomy in reference to the standards put in place by the US-", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "\nFord has announced a bold new plan to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021.\nThe car will be in use by customers by 2021.\nIt said this was most likely as part of an", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_2": "\nFord is the first major car maker to announce a timeline for a fully autonomous vehicle.\nFord is the first major car maker to announce a timeline for a fully autonomous vehicle.

Seawater poured into road tunnels and the subway system. Images showed cars being swept along streets by the torrent.\nWhat are the ingredients for a perfect storm?\n\"The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night,\" city transport director Joseph Lhota said early on Tuesday.\nCity officials had earlier ordered some 375,000 residents out of Lower Manhattan and other areas under threat.\n\"Lower Manhattan is being covered by seawater,\" Howard Glaser, director of operations for the New York state government, was quoted as saying. \"I am not exaggerating. Seawater is rushing into the Battery Tunnel.\"\nThe Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel links Manhattan with the borough of Brooklyn, which is on Long Island.\nThe city's Consolidated Edison utility provider said an explosion at a sub-station, probably caused by flooding or flying debris, blacked out much of Lower Manhattan.\nThe company said about 500,000 homes in Manhattan were without power.\nAs dawn broke, residents emerged to see the havoc wreaked by the storm.\nIn other developments:\nMayor Bloomberg said the storm surge had surpassed the highest forecast, but he expected waters to start receding.\nAt 11:00 EDT (15:00 GMT) the storm's centre was over central Pennsylvania, about 145 miles (235km) west of Philadelphia with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (72km/h) with higher gusts.\nForecasters have said Sandy could linger over as many as 12 states for 24-36 hours.\nPresident Obama has also declared emergencies in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nPublic transport has been suspended in the US capital, New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston.\nAmtrak has suspended passenger train services across the north-east, while nearly 14,000 flights were cancelled, according to Flightaware.com.\nUp to 3ft (91cm) of snow was expected to fall on the Appalachian mountains in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky.\nThe disaster-estimating firm Eqecat has forecast that Sandy could cause economic losses to the US of between $10bn and $20bn (\u00c2\u00a36.2bn-\u00c2\u00a312.4bn).\nHurricane Sandy map and satellite images\nIn pictures: Sandy lashes East

Our aim was to always to win the game, so it is an absolute bonus to get the fourth try at the end.\n\"We are really happy with the performance, but I'm sure when we wake up (on Sunday) morning we know we have to go over there in a week's time. We won't get carried away.\"\nLeicester's director of rugby Richard Cockerill: \"The reality, and it starts with me, is that the performance was not acceptable. 38-0 is not where we want to be.\n\"We have some important players missing, but that is no excuse for where the performance was.\n\"The one good point is that we bring Munster to Welford Road next week.\n\"We can turn it around.\"\nLeicester will have an immediate chance for revenge in next Saturday's return game at Welford Road.\nMunster: Zebo, Sweetnam, Taute, Scannell, Earls, Bleyendaal, Murray; Kilcoyne, Scannell, Ryan, Ryan, Holland, O'Mahony (capt), O'Donnell, Stander.\nReplacements: Marshall for N Scannell 73 mins, Du Toit for Kilcoyne 58, Archer for Ryan 66, Kleyn for Holland 58, O'Donoghue for O'Donnell 58, Williams, Keatley for Bleyendaal 73, Conway for Zebo 68.\nLeicester: Worth, Thompstone, Tuilagi, Williams, Betham, Burns, Genge, T Youngs, Mulipola, Slater, Kitchener, Fitzgerald, O'Connor, McCaffrey.\nReplacements: McGuigan for T Youngs 60, Cilliers for Genge 75, Hamilton for Fitzgerald 43, Evans for McCaffrey 67, Harrison for B Youngs 56, Roberts for Burns 52, Brady for Tuilagi 69.\nReferee: Romain Poite (France)\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.", "summary": "Munster maintained their winning start to the European Champions Cup as they handed Leicester Tigers a record defeat in the competition.", "id": "38227605", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nRead more on Leicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster: As it happened\nRead more on", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nMunster 38-0 Leicester\nRead more on Munster 38-0 Leicester\nMunster 38-0 Leicester: As it happened\nRead more on Munster 3", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nMunster 38-0 Leicester\nRead more on Munster 38-0 Leicester\nMunster 38-0 Leicester: As it happened\nRead more on Munster 3", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nMunster 38-0 Leicester\nRead more on Munster 38-0 Leicester\nMunster 38-0 Leicester: As it happened\nRead more on Munster 3", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nMunster 38-0 Leicester\nRead more on Munster 38-0 Leicester\nMunster 38-0 Leicester: As it happened\nRead more on Munster 3", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nRead more on Leicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster: As it happened\nRead more on", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\n\u00bb Rugby Union News\n\u00bb Rugby Union Results\n\u00bb Rugby Union Fixtures\n\u00bb Rugby Union Tables\n\u00bb Rugby Union Scores\n\u00bb Rugby Union News Headlines\n\u00bb Rugby Union News Feeds\n\u00bb Rugby Union News Videos", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nRead more on Leicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster: As it happened\nRead more on", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster: Pool One - as it happened\nRead more on Leicester Tigers 0-38 Munster:", "decode_al_15_be_05_lay_1": "\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nRead more on Leicester Tigers 0-38 Munster\nLeicester Tigers 0-38 Munster as it happened\nRead more on Le", "decode_al_05_be_05_lay_2": "Tuilagi 69.\nReferee: Romain Poite (France)\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.

Seven children, all girls, woke at least once.\nNone of the boys woke during the tests.\nAmong the children tested were the four boys of Melanie and Stuart Wilkins, who are aged three to 13.\nMelanie is the niece of Mr Coss, who contacted her to help in the research.\nMelanie told me that Jack, 13, Daniel, 10, Lewis, seven, and Oscar, three, had been repeatedly tested and had never woken up when she had activated the smoke alarm.\nThe BBC filmed at night with the Wilkins family. Daniel was the only child to wake up when Melanie set off the smoke alarm in the hall landing.\nSmoke alarms are required to reach 85 decibels at 3m (10ft).\nThe portable speaker used to play the experimental alarm is not as loud, so in order to make a comparison Melanie needed to open the boys' bedroom doors.\nWhen Melanie set off the new sound alert, all four boys woke up immediately.\nShe told me: \"Your children are like gold, they're the most precious things. I didn't think in a million years that our smoke alarm would not wake them up.\"\nMelanie thought the voice recording of a woman's voice was an excellent idea.\nShe said: \"It's like the voice of a parent that they are used to listening to day-in and day-out and maybe subconsciously that is what they hear when the alarm goes off.\"\nResearchers at Dundee say there are several theories they were exploring as to why standard smoke alarms may not wake children.\nRodney Mountain, from the University's School of Medicine, said: \"Children's hearing ability, brain function, sleep patterns and stage of brain development is very different to adults.\n\"We are programmed to respond to human voices warning of danger, such as a mother's voice shouting to warn a child.\n\"Children are not born pre-programmed for our modern world of danger warning sounds from digital beeps and sirens - they have to learn, recognise and interpret these sounds.\"\nSome 500 families from across the UK with children aged between two and 16 are being sought to take part in a trial comparing standard smoke alarms with the new sound.\nProf Nic Daeid said: \"Protecting our children in the event of fire is so fundamentally important that we want to involve parents and their children in expanding this research.\"\nThe researchers said it was important the study did not undermine the need for every home to be fitted with smoke alarms, as these will wake adults and had a proven record in saving lives.\nThe Fire Industry Association, which represents manufacturers of smoke alarms, said it had done no specific research with a focus on children but there were different types of alarm available, such as vibrating pads that could fit under a pillow, for those with hearing problems.\nThe Chief Fire Officers Association said it was \"crucial\" that people tested their smoke alarms regularly, adding: \"As this research does indicate that some children may not wake to the sound of a smoke alarm, parents, guardians and responsible adults should ensure that they prepare an escape plan which must account for this.\n\"Children must woken and evacuated as part of this plan.\"\nFollow Fergus on Twitter", "summary": "Forensic scientists and fire investigators have warned that smoke alarms may not wake children.", "id": "38918056", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe researchers said it was important the study did not undermine the need for every home to be fitted with smoke alarms, as these will wake adults and had a proven record in saving lives.

Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk and include your telephone number.\nThe idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\nHe told the BBC that certain companies in the gig economy have been operating successfully by avoiding paying minimum wage or employee contributions.\n\"I think the scale of it is probably sufficient that we should tighten up on that. Essentially we should enforce the minimum wage on those categories of the self-employed who, when when you look at them are essentially employed in the fundamental nature of how their work is organised.\"\nThe idea has been submitted by the Resolution Foundation to the Taylor Review on modern employment practices.\nMathew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Arts, was appointed last October by the government to lead a review into the effect of new types of businesses, such as Uber and Deliveroo, which have led to an increase in the number of people in short-term and casual work.\nConor D'Arcy of the Resolution Foundation, said: \"While many [of the self-employed] are higher earners who benefit from significant flexibility, around half fall below the low pay earnings threshold of just \u00a3310 a week.\"\n\"The government can start by extending minimum wage protections to those self-employed people whose prices are set by a firm.\n\"This would mean that self-employed people in the gig economy would be given protection against extreme low pay for the first time ever,\" he added.\nBy law most workers are entitled to the National Minimum Wage and the rate they receive depends on their age.\nCurrently for 21-24-year-olds the rate is \u00a37.05 per hour, for 18-20 year olds \u00a35.60 and for 16-17 year olds \u00a34.05. The apprentice rate is \u00a33.50.\nIf you are over 25 the National Living Wage applies to you. That is currently set at \u00a37.50 an hour.\nThe independent Low Pay Commission advises the government on those rates.\nYou will also hear a third type of wage referred to - the \"real living wage\". It is calculated annually by the Living Wage Foundation, an independent group.\nThe rate, which is not statutory, represents \"what employees and their families need to live\", and organisations that pay it receive accreditation from the foundation.\nFor the UK it stands at \u00a38.45 per hour and in London at \u00a39.75 an hour.\nThe Resolution Foundation argues that the test of whether people are really self-employed or simply disguised workers should be whether or not the employer sets the price for the work they do.\nIf applied, that test would affect some well-known industries.\n\"Affected firms would include gig economy-style platforms claiming to simply connect the self-employed to customers but setting the price for work done, or those with standard terms that they apply to a significant number of the self-employed,\" it says.\nThat would mean a big change for tens of thousands of workers, such as 170,000 self-employed Uber and minicab drivers, 40,000 postal and courier staff, 150,000 hairdressers and 80,000 cleaners.\nMike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"It would be helpful if a better distinction could be made between real entrepreneurs and those who, in all but name, have the appearance of being employed by giant corporations.\"\nIn May, the Parliamentary Work and Pensions Committee reported after an inquiry that self-employed status had left some workers vulnerable to \"exploitation\".\nThe committee said that drivers and couriers for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo needed full workers' rights and not \"bogus\" self-employment status.\nThe Institute of Directors (IoD) said it agreed that the status of workers should be clarified by the government, with the publication of easy-to-understand guidance.\nBut Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the IoD, said undermining the gig economy would bring disadvantages.\n\"Evidence from the Labour Force Survey and the ONS suggest that easier routes into self-employment have also led to rising workplace participation for those who have historically struggled to find a job; notably single parents, disabled individuals, and the long-term unemployed,\" he said.\n\"An obligatory minimum wage would undermine the business model of many gig platforms, such as taxi, delivery or cleaning services, who would find it hard to justify paying people at times when there was no demand.\"", "summary": "Some of the self-employed should be entitled to the national minimum wage, a think tank has urged.", "id": "40480214", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\"\nThe idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\"\nThe idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\"The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\"\nThe idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\"\nThe Resolution Foundation says that about half of the 4.8 million people classified as self-employed", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\"The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\"\nThe idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\"The Resolution Foundation says that about half of the 4.8 million people classified as self-employed are low-paid and earn less than \u00a3310 a week.\"\nThe Resolution Foundation says that about", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\"The Resolution Foundation says that about half of the 4.8 million people classified as self-employed are low-paid and earn less than \u00a3310 a week.\"\nThe Resolution Foundation says that about", "decode_al_1_be_05_lay_1": "\"The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.\"\nThe Resolution Foundation says that about half of the 4.8 million people classified as self-employed", "decode_al_1_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe Resolution Foundation says that about half of the 4.8 million people classified as self-employed are low-paid and earn less than \u00a3310 a week.

week, leading to Greek banks having to shut this week.\nGlobal stock markets saw big falls on Monday after the weekend's events.\nAs well as Mr Gabriel, the leaders of the eurozone's other two largest economies said Greek voters would effectively be deciding whether or not they wanted to stay in the eurozone on Sunday.\nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said the choice would be between the euro and the drachma, while French President Francois Hollande said \"what's at stake is... knowing whether the Greeks want to stay within the eurozone\".\nSpeaking to Greek television on Monday evening, Mr Tsipras urged as many Greeks to vote \"no\" as possible on Sunday to give the Greek government a stronger position to restart negotiations.\nHe said his government had a mandate \"to be within the European framework but with more justice\".\n\"They will not kick us out of the eurozone because the cost is immense,\" he said.\nThe UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said a Greek exit would be \"traumatic\" and Britain should not underestimate the knock-on effects.\nHe said UK retirees who live in Greece would continue to receive their pensions, but advised British

exit\nEarlier, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he felt \"betrayed\" by the \"egotism\" shown by Greece in the failed talks on giving heavily indebted Greece the last payment of its international bailout.\nHe said Greek proposals were \"delayed\" or \"deliberately altered\" but added the door was still open to talks.\nDespite the public war of words, a Greek official said Mr Tsipras had spoken to Mr Juncker on Friday and asked him to extend Greece's bailout until the referendum.\nA critical deadline looms on Tuesday, when Greece is due to pay back \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund - the same day its current bailout expires. There are fears of a default and a possible exit from euro.\nMr Juncker said that he still believed a Greek exit from the euro was not an option and insisted that the creditors' latest proposal meant more social fairness.\nThe question which will be put to voters on Sunday will not be as simple as whether they want to stay in the euro or not - instead it asks Greeks to approve or reject the specific terms laid out by Greece's creditors:\n\"Should the agreement plan submitted by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the June 25 eurogroup and consisting of two parts, which form their single proposal, be accepted?

They can choose as many or as few as they like.\nWhen polls close and vote counting begins, the first step is to work out the 'quota', which decides how many votes a candidate needs to be elected.\nTo calculate the quota, you divide the number of valid voting papers cast by the number of seats to be filled plus one, and then add one.\nCandidates who exceed the quota are elected straight away.\nVotes are then redistributed among the other candidates in two ways.\n1. Some candidates may be elected by many more votes than the quota. These extra votes are called the surplus, and are redistributed in proportion to the total number of preferences for other candidates in an elected candidate's ballots.\n2. The lowest ranked candidates are eliminated, and the preferences on their ballot papers are distributed among the other candidates.\nThe process continues, with votes redistributed in these two ways, until all the seats are filled.\nTo illustrate how the process can work, consider an election for the three most popular Shakespeare characters.\nHere is the result from the first round of voting:\nTo calculate the quota: There were 109,525 valid votes cast and three seats to be filled.\nSo, 109,525 divided by (3 seats +1)4, +1 = 27,382\nHamlet has clearly achieved this, so is elected in round one.\nThere are 29,406 surplus votes from Hamlet to be redistributed - and all of his ballots are examined to decide the proportion.\nSome 23% of Hamlet's total ballots were found to have second preferences for Cleopatra.\nTherefore, of the 29,406 surplus, 23% is awarded to Cleopatra = 6,763.4\nQuota: 27,382\nCleopatra now exceeds the quota and is elected at stage 2.\nThe other candidates receive proportional transfers from Hamlet's surplus.\nThere are 6,148 surplus ballots from her new total to redistribute. Again, all of her ballot papers are examined and the new surplus is redistributed in the same way as before.\nQuota: 27,382\nHowever, no one reaches the quota in stage 3 so the last placed candidate - Lady Macbeth - is eliminated.\nAny preferences on her ballots are transferred to the remaining candidates.\nAny votes with only one preference - for Lady Macbeth herself - are discarded, and known as 'non-transferable'.\nQuota: 27,382\nStage 4 concludes with no candidate surpassing the quota.\nLast-placed Romeo is now eliminated and his preferences transferred to the remaining candidates.\nQuota: 27,382\nDesdemona is elected in the final round when Romeo's second preferences are transferred.\nA candidate can win without meeting the quota when there are no more votes available for transfer.\nIn this particular scenario, surpluses were only redistributed in the first two stages.\nHowever, in an election where more seats need to be filled, and with more candidates, the process can happen repeatedly through many stages of counting.\nThe summary scoreboard shows first preference votes and vote share to indicate electoral support across the country.\nThe bar chart at the top of the page shows the top 5 or 6 parties in terms of seats won in the assembly.\nIf more than 6 parties win seats, the parties with fewest seats are amalgamated into a grouping called Others.\nIn the event of a tie - for example two parties have two seats - the party with the most first preference votes nationwide will be named.\nEach constituency page displays a summary of all parties' and candidates' first preferences.\nYou can follow how the stages of counting unfold on the 'stage by stage' tab. This shows who is elected and eliminated in each round and the transferred votes at each stage.\nSeat change will not be shown at national or constituency level in this election. This is because the reduction in seats from 108 to 90 makes a valid comparison extremely difficult.\nOn smaller mobile screens, parties are sometimes abbreviated to 3 or 4 letter codes.

You can save more by cooking, washing and ironing during daylight hours. But the system still works when it's cloudy.\n\"At times, it will even generate when there's a full moon - even though it's just a trickle,\" he says.\nSolar panels don't usually need planning permission, unless you live in a conservation area.\nBut there are some key practical considerations.\nYour roof shouldn't have any shading, either from trees, nearby buildings or chimneys.\nThe angle of the roof should be between 10 and 40 degrees from horizontal, and it should face south or south-west. Up to 40 degrees west of south, or 30 degrees east of south, is ideal.\n\"They also work better when they're not so hot,\" advises Merlin Hyman, the chief executive of Regen SW, which supports renewable energy in the West country.\n\"So a sea breeze is good.\"\nYou will get a higher subsidy if your home is already energy efficient - rating at least a Band D on its Energy Proficiency Certificate (EPC).\nAt the moment, solar power only makes economic sense thanks to public subsidies - which we pay through the green levy on our electricity bills.\nHouses produce 55% of the UK's  CO2 emissions, so the subsidy is designed to help meet climate change targets.\nIt means the government pays you to produce renewable energy, whether you actually use it or not.\nThis is the so-called Feed in Tariff (FiT).\nThe first element is the generation FiT - the amount you are paid for the electricity you generate.\nThe rate of this is gradually reducing, and will next go down on 1 July. You will then be paid at this rate - plus inflation - for 20 years.\nClick here to view the possible savings on your own home.                                                                                                                          Source: Energy Saving Trust\nIn compensation for falling FiT rates, the cost of installing solar panels is going down too.\nThree years ago Steve Kessell paid \u00a310,000. Now the same system can be installed for between \u00a35,000-8,000.\nThe second element of the FiT is the export rate. This covers the energy you don't use yourself, but instead return to the grid. But it is lower than the generation element.\nHence it is more economical to use as much of your own energy as you can, rather than exporting it.\n\"The more you use in your home, the more you're going to make savings,\" says James Wakelin of the Energy Saving Trust (EST).\n\"Pensioners, or those who work at home, will save a lot more than those who work out of the house from nine to five.\"\nGiven the time it takes to get your money back, investing in solar energy is still a bold decision.\nIf you move house in the meantime, the new buyer may or may not appreciate the value of the system you've installed.\nHowever, moves to produce batteries to store home-produced energy could further revolutionise the economics of solar power.\nShould they prove effective, the town of Wadebridge would not only be self-sufficient in energy, but it could become a net exporter too.\nA British town exporting sunlight?

I had negative ideas about it. I thought it was elitist.\"\nBut an open day at the university was \"a very positive experience\", and the human sciences course, which combines a diverse array of subjects from genetics to sociology \"was a big draw\".\nOnce she started, she was aware of a social mix which still did not reflect the general population and shocked by the continued existence of \"rich boys' clubs\" where members are chosen based on wealth and social connections - but there were also \"people from all sorts of backgrounds who were really friendly, open-minded and fun\".\nSleep suffered in her first year as she struggled to juggle a heavy academic workload and a frenetic social life.\nNow she believes her degree is helping her find work in her chosen field of international development and sustainability.\nFreya's initial scepticism about Oxford is not uncommon among some state-school sixth-formers, according to a university spokeswoman, leading to great efforts to improve diversity.\n\"The idea that 'Oxford isn't the kind of place for me' is still something we need to address,\" said the spokeswoman.\nThis year almost 60% of Oxford's intake from state schools - the highest in 40 years.\nAt Cambridge the figure is 62% - up from just over half a decade ago.\n\"Before we uncork the champagne, remember 93% of pupils are in state schools,\" says Ian Bauckham, executive head of a non-selective Kent secondary that sends \"a trickle\" of students to Oxbridge each year.\nMr Bauckham was himself a state-school student who went to Cambridge and graduated with a first.\nHe admits finding it hard to start with. \"I had never mixed with people who had the confidence and social advantage of many people there.\"\nBut once he graduated, he says having been to Cambridge helped him progress in his chosen career of teaching.\nMr Bauckham says his school aims to identify students with Oxbridge potential early, mentioning it to them as soon as Year 10.\n\"It can open doors. These are highly regarded courses, often involving top researchers in their field,\" he tells them.\nHe says preparing his students, who often come from families with no history of university, let alone elite universities, can be \"hard work\".\n\"A lot of the selection is done largely on the basis of interviews which require confidence and poise to do well.\"\nHe fears the process can be weighted against comprehensive students, with some admissions tutors subconsciously preferring students similar to themselves.\n\"Students will need to be able to debate, cope with cut and thrust and respond to unexpected challenges, such as to have done a greater depth and breadth of reading beyond A-level specifications.\n\"Pupils from elite public schools are imbibing this from friends and families from an early age.\"\nMr Bauckham says he has never met anyone who says they regret having gone to Oxford or Cambridge - but socially it can be hard.\n\"If you come from an ordinary family and a comprehensive school and then you meet people from Eton, Harrow, brimming over with confidence, as an 18-year-old you are on a steep learning curve.\n\"Some say, 'I would probably have had more fun at Sheffield University but now I have an Oxbridge degree.'\"\nThis year has seen the highest number of applications to Oxford, with 19,500 applying for 3,500 places.\nAt Cambridge there have been 16,719 applications for about 3,400 places.\nThese figures just add to the aura of Oxbridge.\nThese are all top students competing for places, according to the Oxford spokeswoman: \"Good grades get you to the starting line, but aren't enough on their own to guarantee a place.\n\"There is now a wider mix of backgrounds among applicants.

But the finance minister's sacking has overshadowed everything.\nThere is no doubt that Mr Gordhan was a hard working minister respected globally and came with impeccable anti-apartheid struggle credentials at that.\nMr Zuma used his presidential powers to steamroll a list of cabinet ministers not approved by either his deputy president or the secretary general of the governing African National Congress (ANC) as is the norm.\nThis move by President Zuma has not only surprised ordinary folks on the streets but it has also shocked those at the top table sitting alongside him.\n\"It felt like this list was developed somewhere else and it was given to us just to legitimise it... We are unhappy,\" lamented ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe\nPresident Zuma was clearly rewarding loyalists and getting rid of opponents within the party. Mr Gordhan was sacked with no iota of evidence of malfeasance against him.\nTo demonstrate how high the stakes are for the 74-year-old president you have to look at what opposition member of parliament Julius Malema said before the sacking.\n\"Once Zuma announces the removal of Pravin\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that will be the end of his journey as the president,\" warned the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader.\nMr Malema has lodged an application with the Constitutional Court to order the speaker of parliament to institute impeachment proceedings against Mr Zuma.\nIf you want to know why president Zuma fired Pravin Gordhan, you have to trace the story back to December 2015.\nThis was when the president fired a highly regarded finance minister Nhlanhla Nene and replaced him a little known ANC back bencher Des Van Rooyen. Chaos ensued and markets reacted negatively to the sudden reshuffle.\nThe value of country's currency, the rand, tumbled to record levels, as it did on Friday morning.\nMr Zuma was then forced to make the biggest political U-turn since the end of apartheid. Mr Van Rooyen was removed four days after his appointment.\nMr Gordhan was then brought in to start his second stint as the man in charge of the country's finances.\nSo in essence, Mr Gordhan was never Mr Zuma's choice in the first place.\nSince then he has been plotting to get rid of him. Finally, after much resistance, at the stroke of midnight he had the gall to execute his wishes in spectacular fashion.\nThe president appears to be frustrated by Mr Gordhan's apparent parsimony when it came to spending.\nBu whereas he wanted to keep a tight rein on the money, Mr Zuma wants to spend big.\nThe president supports a deal to build two nuclear reactors set to cost nearly $60bn (\u00c2\u00a348bn).\nMoney the country does not have, according to the outgoing finance minister.\nHe was also keen to slow down the flow of money to state-owned companies like the forever thirsty national carrier South African Airways, the on-and-off power utility Eskom and others such as Transnet, which is responsible for ports and railways.\nBut there are also corruption allegations.\nMr Gordhan's deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, who is also on his way out, said last year that he was offered cash from a member of the wealthy Gupta family with ties to the president on condition that he would channel government contracts to their businesses.\nThe Gupta family denied the charge.\nThis was the beginning of this drama which culminated in Thursday night's political bloodbath.\nBut wait, there is more.\nIn dramatic fashion at the beginning of the week, the president ordered Mr Gordhan to return \"immediately\" from an investment roadshow in London.\nHowever, reports have since emerged that Mr Zuma, based on questionable intelligence, believed that his finance minister was also going to meet with individuals who wanted to overthrow the state.\nAn allegation Mr Gordhan said \"sickens him\".\nThere are also big divisions within the governing alliance.\nOne of the ANC's key partners in the tripartite alliance the South African Communist Party rejected the idea of getting rid of Mr Gordhan outright as soon as the president informed them about his intention.\nDeputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has also reacted with shock. He said the sacking was \"unacceptable\".\nBut has not offered to resign over the issue. Mr Ramaphosa wants to replace Mr Zuma as president of the ANC laster this year. But the president prefers his former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma instead.\nWe have a fight at hand.\nThis reshuffle could have triggered the hairline crack that eventually splits the 105-year-old liberation movement.\nAnd that would bring to an end the ANC's grip on power here, after such great promise.", "summary": "It was the night of the long knives when President Jacob Zuma sacked the finance minister against the wishes of his senior party leaders.", "id": "39453662", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

Yes he did.\n\"In Hong Kong, for example, they're looking at a solution we're looking at carefully where travellers can check their bags in up to two days before their flights, not at the airport but in the centre of town,\" he said.\n\"They then pick up their bags only at their final destination when they finish the flight. It makes things easier for those passengers. It also increases space for passengers on trains on the way to the airport.\"\nSounds good. The only fly in the ointment is it's been tried before in London and it was a commercial flop, according to the Independent's travel editor, Simon Calder.\nSome airline passengers travelling from Heathrow used to be able to drop off their bags at Victoria or Paddington stations in London.\nHowever, there simply wasn't the demand and the service was dropped. \"Clearly it's practical and has been tried, but it's been a commercial failure,\" said Mr Calder.\nBut it's not just the trip to the airport that's under scrutiny.\nAs this graphic from the consultation document shows, the Department for Transport (DfT) wants to hear about the whole passenger experience -  from booking a flight, to airport security, the flight itself and what happens at the other end.\nThe DfT says its consultation on a new strategy \"will take a fresh look at the aviation sector and its challenges and opportunities, as well as the role of government\".\nSo just what would make air travellers happier? What could be done to improve the experience?\nTalk to consumer groups and they focus on compensation for when things go wrong, such as delayed or cancelled flights.\nAt the UK European Consumer Centre Wojtek Szezerba said that of the 500 customer complaints about airlines the group received last year, two thirds were about cancellations or delays \"usually to do with the difficulty of obtaining compensation\".\nSimon Calder puts it more bluntly and says some airlines are \"lying through their teeth to avoid paying compensation\".\nHowever, he argues, this could be remedied fairly simply.\n\"That's a matter of the CAA enforcing the rules and having sanctions for airlines that misrepresents the rules and mislead passengers,\" he says.\nThe DfT consultation document also said that, along with its \"particular focus on consumers\", the strategy would \"look at where government could, and should, make a difference\".\nHowever, rather than fiddling at the edges, Mr Calder thinks there are a couple of big fixes which would improve consumers' experiences.\nThe big picture is that two airports in particular - Heathrow and Gatwick - are simply too busy.\nHe has a couple of suggestions about what could be done about that.\nOne is to increase airport capacity. The government has said its preferred option is to build a third runway at Heathrow, although it's not likely to see the light of day for many years.\nHis second idea is to increase the tax - or Air Passenger Duty - for passengers using Heathrow or Gatwick to encourage people to fly from other airports.\nEither one of the solutions would relieve the pressure on the two airports, reckons Mr Calder.\nBack in the day, of course, it all seemed so much simpler.\nBetween 1957 and 1974 British European Airways passengers flying from Heathrow could check-in and drop off their bags at the West London Air Terminal on the Cromwell Road in west London, now a branch of Sainsbury's.\nThen they were whisked off by bus down the M4 to the airport where they were deposited right next to the aircraft.\nPie in the sky? Well, today security concerns would probably rule out dropping people off airside.\nHowever, there was another problem - even then traffic often held up the coach and delayed plane departures.\nSo nothing's ever perfect.\nAnd indeed even Simon Calder, who's clocked up more air miles than most, reckons the UK has \"the best range of options in Europe ... and the world, in terms of destinations and fares\".\nBut he adds \"often the end to end journey is less than pleasurable\".\nSome may regard that as an understatement - in which case the DfT wants to hear from them.", "summary": "Ah, the glamour of air travel.", "id": "40678732", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "100 words max.\nThe consultation closes on 15 February 2017.\nThe government's consultation on a new aviation strategy is open until 15 February 2017.", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "100 words max.\nThe consultation closes on 15 February 2017.\nThe government's consultation on a new aviation strategy is open until 15 February 2017.", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "100 words max.\nThe consultation closes on 15 February 2017.\nThe government's consultation on a new aviation strategy is open until 15 February 2017.", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\"The early morning wake-up call, the nightmare journey to the airport on public transport laden with unwieldy suitcases.

First the words - they're good. Well, some of them are.\nLet's review a little of what Mitch McConnell had to say as the new majority leader of the Senate.\n\"We do have an obligation to work together on the issues where we can agree,\" he told a news conference in his home state of Kentucky.\n\"Just because we have a two-party system doesn't mean we have to be in perpetual conflict... We're going to pass legislation. Some of it he may not like, but this gridlock and dysfunction can be ended.\"\nAnd from the president, the same cautiously optimistic words, as he acknowledged the Republicans had had a good night.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new Congress to make the next two years as productive as possible. I am committed to making sure that I measure ideas not by whether they are from Democrats or Republicans but whether they work for the American people,\" Mr Obama said.\n\"And that's not to say that we won't disagree over some issues that we're passionate about. We will. Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign. I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like.\n\"That's natural. That's how our democracy works. But we can surely find ways to work together on issues where there's broad agreement among the American people.\"\nSo that's all OK then. Well not quite. There are profound ideological differences, and you don't have to scratch the surface very hard to find the fissures that lie beneath.\nLet's just take one big example - immigration reform. Mr Obama has been frustrated beyond belief that he has been unable to make progress on this. So yesterday, after the conciliatory words, he said he could act unilaterally if necessary.\nBy issuing an executive order, the president can simply bypass Congress - and at a stroke give the opportunity to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country.\nMr McConnell said this would be \"poisoning the well... it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull.\" (Why use one metaphor when two will do?)\nSo already within minutes of peace breaking out, you have skirmishing. John Boehner chose a different metaphor - he said if the president continues to act unilaterally, he will be like a child playing with matches and will burn himself.\nAnd then just as the president wants to take action on immigration, the Republicans are equally passionate about reforming/unpicking the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nMr Boehner has just said it is hurting the economy. But if the Congress passed legislation to repeal it, it is a 100% certain bet that the president will flash his veto.\nSo on what other issues might we see progress?\nMr Obama has wavered over the Keystone XL pipeline that will run from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico for fear of offending environmental campaigners ahead of the mid-terms, even though business is desperate for the measure and it would create jobs.\nThe president could trade that for Republican support to back greater spending on infrastructure - roads, bridges and the like.\nCorporate tax reform is firmly on the Republican agenda, but the president would not want to concede this without something back. Perhaps it would be movement on increasing the minimum wage, something that was backed in ballot initiatives in a number of Republican states on the night of the mid-term elections.\nBut you just have to listen to the two sides, and you can only come away with one conclusion: the antipathy and hostility far outweighs any sense of trust.\n\"This is not about politics, this is about doing what is right for the country,\" John Boehner said with absolute sincerity.\nBarack Obama would, with equal sincerity and passion, say exactly the same. They just fundamentally disagree on what is right.\nAnd no amount of bourbon or rounds of golf is going to sort that.", "summary": "If you are a parent and you have two kids who are squabbling badly you have the sanction of sending them to their rooms.", "id": "29945566", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n1.

and less-educated sectors of society finds itself in trouble. Now those who support the government find themselves under attack even within their own families,\" Mr Carneiro says.\nBut he says Brazil has not yet become as divided as other neighbours in the region.\n\"As lively as the debate here is, we are still moderate compared to what is going on in Argentina, Venezuela and Chile, for example,\" he says.\nMr Carneiro says that broader access to information and the internet have fanned the debate.\nBut he warns that the internet can also isolate people from opinions other than their own.\n\"You tend to connect to your network of contacts and that defines the kind of information you receive,\" he says.\n\"Add to that the fact that people rely less and less upon information provided by professional journalists, who are capable to moderate these topics more appropriately,\" he explains.\nTwenty-seven-year old actor Guilherme Carrasco Neto says he feels \"cornered\" when talking politics with his family.\nMr Neto is critical of the way Lula was taken away by police for questioning, which he says was an attempt to portray the ex-leader as a criminal.\nHe says his relatives gang up on him when he defends the former leader.\nHis mother is very critical of the Workers' Party (PT) administration and while his father tries to tone down the debate when it gets too heated, Mr Neto says that when his brother and sister-in-law pitch in it is \"overwhelming\".\n\"My brother is opposed to the policies of the Workers' Party. I am not a party member, but I do respect the social advances brought about by their government,\" he says.\nMr Neto says that his sister-in-law is one of those who benefitted from Lula's policies.\nShe, too, was awarded a ProUni scholarship and got her degree in economics thanks to that scholarship.\nMr Neto says he often thinks of bringing this up in an argument with his anti-Lula sister-in-law but has so far refrained in order to avoid a row.\nMr Neto's older brother Daniel is 35.\nHe thinks Guilherme has a \"romanticised view\" of politics which he blames on his youth.\n\"He [Guilherme] believes that capitalism and the market economy are bad,\" Daniel Neto says.\n\"He thinks that businessmen must be regulated. We try to teach him that you can't produce if you don't make money.\n\"Handing out money to people won't stimulate growth.\"\nDaniel Neto's view is typical of those who are critical of Lula.\nThey argue that the former president's popularity was propped up by the economic stability Brazil experienced during his two mandates from 2003 to 2011, a stability they say was fuelled by a boom in commodity prices rather than Lula's economic policies.\nWith the Brazilian economy going through its worst recession in two decades, Daniel Neto reckons that the only way out of the current political and economic crisis is to impeach Lula's protege and successor in office, President Dilma Rousseff.\n\"This government is a total fiasco. We expected it to be bad but it's turned out worse,\" he says of Ms Rousseff's administration.\n\"The corruption scandals and Ms Rousseff's incapacity to play the political game is ruining the country,\" he says.\nAnd as for Lula's generous social programmes, the former leader \"only distributed the extra money that came in,\" he says.\n\"He's a crook,\" he adds.", "summary": "Sitting alongside his family, Vitor Ricciardi Chiarello is watching a TV report on the detention of former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.", "id": "35772363", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nLula was briefly held for questioning on 4 March as part of a massive corruption investigation involving the state-oil company, Petrobras.

Operating a busy and complicated network is challenging at the best of times - and we are doing so during one of the largest investments in modernisation since Scotland's railway was built in Victorian times.\n\"There is no alternative, though, to doing the work.\n\"The decision to invest in the railway's future has been put off too many times and it is in the best long term interests of passengers that we get on and do it. It is then our job to do whatever we can to keep people moving during this work and to better communicate when things go wrong and explain why they go wrong.\"\nThe work at Queen Street followed on from a similar project at Winchburgh Tunnel, and is part of the multi-billion pound investment in Scotland's railway network.\nIt also includes the electrification of the line between Glasgow and Edinburgh, similar work on the Shotts line, electrification of the line between Stirling, Dunblane and Alloa and a major upgrade of the line between Aberdeen and Inverness.\nThere were also several large-scale incidents during the survey period - including a major one at Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh that caused widespread disruption.\nTransport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: \"The results around the country are disappointing. Scottish passengers and those travelling in peak hours in London and the south east are bearing the brunt of poor performance.\n\"The timetable on parts of the London and South East's railway can be a work of fiction which passengers cannot rely on. As passenger numbers rise, parts of the rail network will remain brittle until welcome improvements are in place and working.\"\nLast November, Transport Minister Humza Yousaf apologised to ScotRail passengers following criticism of ScotRail's reliability since Abellio took over the contract in April 2015.\nMr Yousaf, who also suggested rail services could be taken into the public sector in the future, had previously ordered ScotRail to draw up an improvement plan, which was published in full on 29 November.\nFigures published earlier this month showed the reliability of ScotRail trains significantly improved in the weeks after the improvement plan was published.\nThe PPM data showed 89.7% of trains arrived within five minutes of schedule in the four weeks to 7 January. This was a 6% rise on the previous four weeks, and a 2.8% improvement on the same period last year.\nBut ScotRail's annual performance was 90% - below the 91.3% target set in Abellio's contract for the franchise.\nMr Yousaf was questioned by MSPs about the latest figures at Holyrood.\nHe said he was \"disappointed\" by the results, but insisted progress had been made during \"an exciting and challenging period for rail in Scotland\".\nHe said: \"Let me be clear, ScotRail is not yet performing at the level I would like it to. However, let's also be clear, neither is the situation the apocalyptic scenario often painted by our opponents.\"\nScottish Conservative MSP Liam Kerr said it was right Mr Yousaf came to the chamber in the wake of the change of management at ScotRail, saying the government had \"driven Mr Verster from his post\".\nHe said the government had been responsible for \"ill-thought-through announcements regarding public sector bids and the future of the franchise\", \"uncosted raids\" on funds and \"the situation on the ground deteriorating\" for commuters, asking if new boss Alex Hynes would be given the government's full support.\nMr Yousaf replied that he would not take lectures from a Tory on rail services, adding that he did not recognise the Scottish rail service described. He added that the government would back Mr Hynes, and hoped all MSPs would.\nLabour's Neil Bibby said passengers were fed up with the level of delays, cancellations and skipped stops, asking if Mr Yousaf would take responsibility if targets were not hit.\nThe minister replied that \"it must be very depressing to live in the mind of Neil Bibby, where everything seems to be going wrong\", insisting there had been improvements in services.", "summary": "Passenger satisfaction with ScotRail services has fallen but remains higher than the UK as a whole, despite problems with delays and cancellations.", "id": "38729862", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The PPM data showed 89.7% of trains arrived within five minutes of schedule in the four weeks to 7 January.

Two-thirds of the websites, including the popular Baidu and Sina portals, were affected, the China National Radio reports.\nThe Global Times reported that domestic internet traffic was redirected to a website owned by US company Dynamic Internet Technology. The company has denied any involvement in the outage.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, the company \"sells anti-censorship web services tailored for Chinese users\".\n\"The incident is possibly caused by a hacker attack, but the real attacker remains unknown as the hacker could have used the Dynamic's IP address as a shield,\" the Global Times quotes an unnamed security expert as saying.\nSeveral experts tell the China National Radio that the attack is \"not malicious\" and will not cause an information leak for the users, while an article on the China.org.cn, a government-authorised internet portal, says the outage once again brings the problem of internet security into focus.\nThe Chinese edition of the Global Times adds that experts do not think the attack originates from the US.\n\"The US is already a 'super super' big country in cyberspace. It holds the majority of internet resources, so such an attack will not benefit the US government or the military, but will only alert China about the importance of internet security,\" it quotes another unnamed cyber expert as saying.\nIn other news, the China Daily calls for the world's policymakers to tackle income disparity after an Oxfam report revealed that the world's richest 85 people own as much wealth as half of the world's population.\nThe paper, however, says that China has achieved \"some progress\" in closing the rich-poor income gap.\nOfficial data released on Monday shows that China's Gini coefficient, a measure of the income gap between the rich and the poor, has dropped slightly from 0.473 in 2013 compared with 0.474 in 2012.\nThe China Daily points out that the Gini coefficient \"has eased from 0.491 in 2008 to 0.473 in 2013\" which \"bears testimony that the inclusiveness of the country's economic growth is increasing\".\nThe Shanghai Daily, however, notes that the income gap in China is still higher than the warning level of 0.4 set by the United Nations.\nIn similar vein, state-owned Economic Information observes that this is the first time officials have published the figures in the past 10 years.\nThe website praises the effort of the new leadership in closing the income gap and says that releasing the figures is a \"positive sign\" and such \"important\" information will make the work of tackling income disparity easier.\nMeanwhile, several media outlets are also reporting that China is building the world's largest (10,000-metric tonne) marine surveillance ship, which surpasses Japan's 7,175-tonne patrol boat.\nOfficial channel CCTV says state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation has signed the contract to construct the ship.\n\"If the rest of the massive vessel is fully completed, China will overtake Japan as owner of world's biggest surveillance ship,\" the CCTV adds.\nHowever, the company appears to have retracted the information on its website and has \"declined to confirm the news\", reports the Global Times.\nIn regional politics, China's Foreign Ministry has announced that President Xi Jinping will not be meeting Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics.\nThe Global Times says Japan likes \"corridor diplomacy\" or \"chance encounter diplomacy\", which means creating an opportunity to meet informally, but now China has \"blocked the door\" to such meetings with an \"insincere\" Mr Abe.\nElsewhere, the paper also reports that Chinese activist Xu Zhiyong's trial has started at the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court.\nMr Xu is charged with \"gathering crowds to disrupt public order\". He is one of several activists from a transparency movement who are facing trials this week.\nThe Global Times' Chinese version and other state media outlets appear to be not covering the story.\nAnd finally, reports of the New York police's alleged beating of an elderly Chinese man who jaywalked has also grabbed the Chinese media's attention.\nAt least 30% of netizens who took part in an internet poll on popular portal Sina support the actions of the police.\nThe Global Times observes the \"double standard\" view that many hold and comments that if Chinese police were to beat a jaywalker, people will immediately start criticising the force.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Children are being made to pick-pocket on the streets and steal from cash machines.\"\nModern slaves in the UK, often said to be hiding in plain sight, are working in our nail bars, on construction sites, in brothels, on cannabis farms and in agriculture.\nTraffickers are using the internet to lure their victims with hollow promises of jobs, education and even love.\nAlbania, Nigeria, Vietnam, Romania and Poland are the most likely countries of origin, but some victims are from the UK itself. In 2013, 90 were UK nationals.\nThere is no typical victim. They can be men, women or children of all ages but it is normally more prevalent among the most vulnerable, minorities or socially-excluded groups.\nMany believe they are escaping poverty, limited opportunities at home, a lack of education, unstable social and political conditions or war. But their slave masters are usually out to make financial gain.\nSexual exploitation is the most common form of modern slavery reported in the UK, followed by labour exploitation, forced criminal exploitation and domestic servitude.\nIn 2014, the Home Office estimated there were between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims in the UK - just 2,340 of those were officially reported and recorded.\nSources: Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner Strategic Plan 2015-2017 and Modernslavery.co.uk\nMrs May said a review to mark the first anniversary of the Modern Slavery Act, which she drew up as home secretary, found there had been 289 modern slavery offences prosecuted in 2015 - and a 40% rise in the number of victims identified.\nBut barrister Caroline Haughey, who carried out the review, said she found that police and criminal justice agencies lacked consistency in dealing with the issue.\nMrs May said the first government taskforce on modern slavery would see ministers \"get a real grip of this issue right across Whitehall and co-ordinate and drive further progress in the battle against this cruel exploitation\".\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will also be asked to carry out an investigation to make sure that all police forces in England and Wales \"treat this crime with the priority it deserves\".\n\"[The government] must work collaboratively with law enforcement agencies across the world, to track and stop these pernicious gangs who operate across borders and jurisdictions,\" Mrs May said.\nShe added: \"These crimes must be stopped and the victims of modern slavery must go free...\n\"Just as it was Britain that took an historic stand to ban slavery two centuries ago, so Britain will once again lead the way in defeating modern slavery and preserving the freedoms and values that have defined our country for generations.\"\nSarah Champion, Labour's shadow minister for preventing abuse, said government cuts to police forces and local authorities had left professionals without the resources to stamp out slavery.\n\"We must be doing more to prevent this horrendous crime but, looking at her [Theresa May's] track record as home secretary, I'm not optimistic,\" she said.\nShe cited figures that last year 982 children were identified as victims of modern slavery and taken into local authority care, but within days, 60% had gone missing, presumed to be back with their traffickers.\nThe Modern Slavery Act 2015 states an offence is committed if someone holds another in slavery or servitude or requires them to perform forced or compulsory labour.\nThe legislation increased the maximum jail term for people traffickers from 14 years to life, and gave courts in England and Wales powers to impose orders to restrict the activities of suspected traffickers.\nIt was aimed at consolidating offences used to prosecute those who enslave others into a single act.", "summary": "Britain will lead the fight against modern slavery, Theresa May has said, vowing to make it her mission to help rid the world of the \"barbaric evil\".", "id": "36934853", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe UK government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.\nThe taskforce will be led by the Home Office and will bring together ministers from across government.\nIt will be supported by a new \u00a333m", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe UK government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.\nThe taskforce will be led by the Home Office and will bring together ministers from across government.\nIt will be supported by a new \u00a333m", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe UK government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.\nThe taskforce will be led by the Home Office and will bring together ministers from across government.\nIt will be supported by a new \u00a333m", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe UK government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.\nThe taskforce will be led by the Home Office and will bring together ministers from across government.\nIt will be supported by a new \u00a333m", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe UK government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.\nThe taskforce will be led by the Home Office and will bring together ministers from across government.\nIt will be supported by a new \u00a333m", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.\nThe government has announced a new taskforce to tackle modern slavery.

But this England team are not sure of a lot of things. They are not sure of their best bowling attack or their best batting order.\n\"Wicket-taking was Steven Finn's knack but he can't get it together at the moment. He is tall and athletic and yet his bowling - although fast - is just not doing the job.\"\nWhen England batted again in the final hour, a nominal 42 runs behind after their own 212-7 declared on Friday's first day, Joe Root was caught behind for one before Michael Carberry (37 not out) and Gary Ballance (eight not out) saw them to the close at 47-1.\nSwann's figures of 4-56 reflected the opposition's desire to go after him, much as Australia had with success in the first Test at Brisbane, with three of his wickets caught in the deep.\nPanesar's three wickets - in his first appearance of the tour's five weeks thus far - came off 19 steady overs as stand-in captain Ian Bell gave both spinners long spells in the fierce heat.\nPanesar bowled opener Steve Cazzulino for 48 after Swann had broken the opening partnership of 78 by having Marcus Harris caught by a back-pedalling Finn at mid-on for 49.\nThe same combination accounted for Michael Hill for 13, but with the ball in hand Finn was too short too often, his 15 overs going for 61 as the Chairman's XI unheralded and inexperienced batsman enjoyed themselves in front of a refreshed crowd in Alice Springs.\nFor much of this match, the atmosphere was akin to a low-key county game at a festival ground, which made the struggles of Finn and Rankin all the more chastening.\nThree years ago Finn was England's leading wicket-taker after three Tests; he was also the second fastest Englishman to 50 Test wickets after Sir Ian Botham.\n31 Oct-2 Nov: drew with Western Australia Chairman's XI, Perth\n6-9 Nov: drew with Australia A, Hobart\n13-16 Nov: beat Australian Invitational XI, Sydney\n21-25 Nov: First Test, Brisbane: lost by 381 runs\n29-30 Nov: drew with Chairman's XI, Alice Springs\n5-9 Dec: 2nd Test, Adelaide\n13-17 Dec: 3rd Test.

All-rounder Ben Stokes bowled 13 wicketless overs at a cost of 37 runs.\nJosh Lalor was able to compile an unhurried 45 before becoming Panesar's third victim, while Muirhead's 29 came off only 17 deliveries as the second new ball was clouted around the Traeger Park Oval.\nEngland came on this tour with three tall fast bowlers in Tremlett, Finn and Rankin, looking to exploit the hard, bouncy pitches down under as both Tremlett and Finn had been able to on the corresponding tour in 2010-11.\nBut none of the three men has carried a sustained threat, leaving the door open to Bresnan as he continues his rapid rehabilitation from a stress fracture of the back.\nBallance's 54 in England's first innings here in Australia's Red Centre make him the most likely man to replace Jonathan Trott in the Test side after the experienced number three returned to the UK with a stress-related illness.\nWhether he would bat in Trott's position at three or lower down the order is less clear, with Root failing as an opener on Saturday afternoon and Bell unlikely to move up from five.\nWith Australia coach Darren Lehmann insisting that he will pick his strongest side when the second Test begins at the Adelaide Oval on 5 December, it leaves England with all the selection headaches as they look to fight their way back into the series after the 381-run thrashing at the Gabba.", "summary": "England's final outing before the second Ashes Test drifted to the expected draw as their second-string pace bowlers once again failed to impress.", "id": "25165623", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the conditions on the second and final day of the Chairman's XI match in Alice Springs.\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nEngland's tour of Australia has been a disaster so far, with the first Test defeat by 381 runs at the Gabba in Brisbane followed by a draw in the Chairman's XI game in Alice", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the conditions on the second and final day of the Chairman's XI match in Alice Springs.\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the conditions in Alice Springs, with Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin struggling to make an impact.\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the conditions on the second and final day of the Chairman's XI match in Alice Springs.\nEngland's bowlers were unable to make the most of the", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nEngland's batting was a shambles in the first Test, with the top three -

Given the dramas of the past week, it may of course be gallows humour.\nIt all began on Monday, as markets reacted to the 'No' vote in Greece; attention then switched to the share-price crash in China and the UK budget. By the end, all eyes were back on Athens.\nThe macro-economic implications of the crisis were being chewed over at Loddington village hall in leafy Leicestershire; along with ham sandwiches, pork pies and sausage rolls.\nAt their monthly meeting, members of the Billesdon & District Investment Club were also enjoying a glass or two of Sauvignon Blanc, to help them swallow the news of tumbling markets.\nClub member James Gore-Brown thinks prices could fall further. \"I don't recommend anything at the moment. I'm a real bear,\" he says.\nBut Roger Peel, the club's declared expert on Greece, is keen to invest. \"I would see any sudden dip in the market as an opportunity,\" he declares.\nSo is it time for investors to buy or sell?\nWhile Shanghai seemed a lot further away than Athens at the start of the week, stories of large losses amongst Chinese investors began to steal the headlines.\nHousewives to hairdressers have lost thousands, after piling in to the market just as share prices peaked.\nShopkeeper and mother Lin Jinxia told the BBC how she and her husband had lost more than \u00c2\u00a310,000.\nAfter more than doubling in value over the last year, the Shanghai Composite has fallen by 30% over the last month, with trading in more than half the companies on the index now suspended.\n\"The bubble is bursting, and the Shanghai index has collapsed as a consequence,\" says Richard Tonge, another member of the club.\nThe question for investors in Europe is how much the Chinese fall will affect share prices here.\n\"Despite few foreign investors having much exposure to the Chinese stock markets, the meltdown matters,\" says Nigel Green, the founder of the deVere Group.\n\"Indeed, it is hugely significant because it will send shock waves throughout global capital markets.\"\nHe advises investors to revise portfolios, and  be fully diversified - across geographical regions and asset classes - investing not only in shares, but in bonds, cash and commodities too.\nAnyone who thinks we are immune from the Chinese effect may like to look at HSBC, the UK's second largest company. Heavily exposed to China, and dual-listed in Hong Kong, at one stage this week its share price was down 14%, compared to its peak in April.\nRebecca O'Keefe, head of investments at Interactive Investor, also points out that China's move away from heavy industry has caused a collapse in worldwide metal prices.\n\"The FTSE 100 is under pressure from significantly lower commodity prices, which will impact most UK investors,\" she says.\nThe end of the week saw London shares bounce sharply upwards as prospects for a new Greek bail-out hardened, but no one knows what the eventual outcome may be.\nAnd as often in the stock market, the danger is that the Greek crisis is a catalyst for general gloom.\nGreece, China and the prospect of rising interest rates in the US have already led to a 7% drop in the FTSE 100 since its peak on 27 April.\n\"These risk combining into a more generalised swathe of bearish sentiment that ricochets around the globe, as institutional investors and traders move to take further risk off the table,\" says Jason Hollands, the managing director of investment firm Tilney Bestinvest.\nIn other words, shares may have further to fall over the next few months.\nIn particular he thinks the US market looks expensive, with shares trading on 26 times earnings.\nBut with the European Central Bank (ECB) continuing its programme of quantitative easing (QE), he thinks there may well be some value in European funds.\nSome experts are a little more optimistic about the outlook.\n\"Not only is the Greek tragedy almost over, but the Chinese authorities have taken extensive steps to support both their economy and their markets,\" says Rebecca O'Keefe.\n\"The current weakness in markets may therefore offer an attractive entry point for brave equity investors.\"\nIndeed members of the Billesdon Investment Club decided in the end not to sell shares, but to buy more.\nAfter this week's UK budget, they decided to invest in Bovis, Topps Tiles, and Rolls-Royce.\n\"We're very positive, but we're taking a three-to-five year view,\" says club chairman Nic Olsen.\n\"We're buying good shares on bad days.\"", "summary": "\"Did you know they're going to print euros on Greece-proof paper?\"", "id": "33461144", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The macro-economic implications of the crisis were being chewed over at Loddington village hall in leafy Leicestershire; along with ham sandwiches, pork pies and sausage rolls.\"\nThe", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\"The Billesdon Investment Club decided in the end not to sell shares, but to buy more.\"\nI'm not sure what the context is.\nI'm not sure what the context is.

In order to get from power stations to homes and businesses around the country, energy passes through the grid's pylons and cables.\nIt has been operating since 1933, when it first started carrying electricity across the countries and into homes. By 1946, 80% of households were connected to the grid by pre-wired electricity supplies in houses. In the 1950s, construction began on a new \"super grid\", which included new 42-metre pylons and more than 4,500 new transmission lines.\nToday, National Grid plc is the company appointed by Ofgem to manage Britain's grid and the entirely separate network of gas pipelines.\nIt owns and maintains the high-voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales. Scotland has its own electricity networks, run by SSE (Scottish and Southern Energy) and SP Energy Networks.\nThe grid is UK-wide, so that if a local power station breaks down, another can supply power to its area.\nThere are two control centres - one for the northern half of Britain, and the other for the southern half. Their exact locations are a secret.\nIt is also linked by interconnectors to France, the Netherlands and Northern Ireland, which means that countries that have a surplus of electricity can send it to ones that are lacking.\nGenerators are the device at the centre of most power stations that convert mechanical power into electrical power.\nIn order to be connected to the National Grid, generators have to pay a transmission charge - but the charge varies depending on location.\nThose generators that are far from the main centre of demand will be charged more more because it costs more to transport the energy further - maintaining long power lines requires more maintenance.\nThe further the plant is from London and the South East - the most densely populated areas - the higher the charges.\nThe aim of the higher fees is to encourage power companies to invest in generation capacity where it's most needed.\nBut it is not always easy to build plants in the areas with lowest transmission charges, as Paul Younger, professor of Energy Engineering at the University of Glasgow, explains.\nHe told the BBC: \"Ironically, getting planning permission for power generation close to densely-populated areas is very difficult, so National Grid is trying to force things one way, where planning policies are trying to force them the other.\"\nElectricity is sent through the National Grid cables at very high voltages - between 132,000 and 400,000. It benefits National Grid to not have to keep investing in reinforcing the high-voltage grid necessary to transport the power long distances. That's why Southern English generators pay reduced charges - and sometimes they even receive payments.\nThis is unlike most of Europe, where generators pay a flat fee to connect to the rest of the grid.\nLongannet, a Fife power station that burns coal to produce electricity for the grid, pays about \u00c2\u00a340m a year just to be connected to the National Grid purely because of its location. It is relatively far from the centres of highest demand.\nSuppliers - energy companies such as Scottish Power - also pay charges to take power from the network and supply it to their customers. According to Ofgem, this accounts for about 4% of a household energy bill.\nIts owners Scottish Power says it is very important. They insist that Fife's Longannet power station, the second largest in the UK, might have to close because of the \u00c2\u00a340m annual fee it pays to connect to the National Grid.\nScottish Power, which supplies electricity and gas to UK homes and businesses, said this puts it at a disadvantage when competing with UK plants.\nThis year, the UK government is running the first \"capacity market auction\", where suppliers bid to guarantee electricity generation for the winter of 2018/19.\nBut Scottish Power has decided not to enter the Longannet plant, saying that financial changes need to be made or the plant will have to close.\nIn July, Ofgem said it was going to change the way it calculated what generators pay to use the electricity transmission network. It said: \"Analysis indicates the changes will lead to a more efficient system which will benefit customers.\"\nThe changes are not due to come into effect until 1 April 2016 - but Ofgem say that their updated methodology will reduce the north and south divide in transmission charges.\nIn the short term, Scotland's energy minister Fergus Ewing wants more urgent action. He claims Longannet is being priced out of the market.\nLongannet powers about two million homes - so if it closes, Scotland's power supply will be affected.\nProf Younger said: \"At a stroke it would remove the supply of about 25% of all electricity consumed in Scotland, which would make it very difficult to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing, without increasing reliance on power imports from England - for which there is not sufficient inter-connector capacity on the National Grid anyway.\"", "summary": "The owners of Scotland's largest power plant say its future is uncertain because of the \u00c2\u00a340m annual fee it has to pay to be connected to the National Grid.", "id": "29509021", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "Longannet is a coal-fired power station in Fife, Scotland.

In death, he was afforded all the trappings of state.\nHradcany Square was filled with the smell of incense as the Archbishop of Prague, Dominik Duka, made the procession into St Vitus Cathedral, accompanied by priests and altar servers.\nInside, Vaclav Havel's coffin lay draped with the flag of the country he led for a decade after the \"velvet divorce\" from Slovakia in 1993. The red, white and blue colours of the Czech Republic also decorated ribbons worn by many of those gathered outside, along with black ribbons of mourning.\nMany of those who gathered on this cold, damp day in Prague to watch the funeral on a large outdoor TV screen were too young to remember the days when, in 1989, Vaclav Havel rose from political prisoner to leader of his country in a matter of months. But for young and old alike, Havel is a symbol of freedom and democracy.\nMore than 20 years after the Velvet Revolution there are fears that the former Czech president's spirit of freedom could be threatened by a new wave of intolerance in some European countries.\nBut, as the funeral drew to a close and the coffin left the cathedral, the crowd broke into sustained, warm applause - sharing the sentiment voiced in Vaclav Havel's most well-known quote, that truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred.\nObituary: Vaclav Havel\nFuneral in pictures\nThe Archbishop of Prague read out a tribute from Pope Benedict, praising Mr Havel's courageous defence of human rights and his visionary leadership in creating a new democratic system.\n\"Remembering how courageously Mr Havel defended human rights at a time when these were systematically denied to the people of your country, and paying tribute to his visionary leadership... I give thanks to God for the freedom that the people of the Czech Republic now enjoy,\" Pope Benedict said in his statement.\nThe former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright - who was herself born in Prague - spoke at the ceremony, along with Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and current Czech President Vaclav Klaus.\nShe said Vaclav Havel had \"brought light to the places of deepest darkness\".\n\"He was one of the most respected men of the world, but was never satisfied that he had done everything he could have done,\" she said, adding that he would terribly missed but never forgotten.\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were among mourners.\nThe presidents of France and Germany also attended, along with UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Poland's own dissident-turned-president, Lech Walesa and current leaders from across Eastern Europe.\nAs Havel's coffin left the gothic cathedral, through its Golden Gate and en route to the city's Strasnice crematorium for a private family funeral, the crowd broke out into a long burst of applause.\nThe urn with Havel's ashes is to be buried at his family's plot at Prague's Vinohrady cemetery alongside his first wife, Olga, who died in 1996.\nAhead of the ceremony, thousands of people queued to pay their respects at his coffin as it lay in state at Prague Castle.\nLater on Friday, a rock concert and festival of Havel's plays is due to take at the Lucerna Palace that the family built in the early 20th Century.\nVaclav Havel first made his name as a playwright in the 1960s.\nThe increased freedom brought to Czechoslovakia by the Prague Spring in 1968 allowed him to satirise the communist old guard, which won him wide public acclaim.\nBut the Soviet invasion later that year saw his work banned and he was driven underground.\nHe became Czechoslovakia's most famous dissident and was jailed for \"anti-state activity\".\nIn 1989, when communism fell, he moved in a matter of months from being a political prisoner to president of the country.\nThe euphoria soon faded when Slovak nationalists succeeded in their campaign for independence during 1992.\nThis prompted Havel to resign from the presidency, but a few months later after the \"velvet divorce\" at the start of 1993, he was re-elected Czech president.\nAlthough he was sometimes a reluctant leader, he continued to serve as president until 2003.", "summary": "Czechs and world leaders have been bidding farewell to former Czech President Vaclav Havel at a state funeral in Prague.", "id": "16304858", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nVaclav Havel, the former Czech president who led his country's peaceful \"velvet revolution\" that toppled communism, has died at the age of 75.\nHavel, who was president from ", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nVaclav Havel, the former Czech president who led his country's peaceful \"velvet revolution\" and became a symbol of the struggle for freedom in the former communist bloc, has died at the age of 75", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nVaclav Havel, the former Czech president who led his country's peaceful \"velvet revolution\" and became a symbol of the struggle for freedom in the former communist bloc, has died at the age of 75", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nVaclav Havel, the former Czech president who led his country's peaceful \"velvet revolution\" and became a symbol of the struggle for freedom in the former communist bloc, has died at the age of 75", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nVaclav Havel, the former Czech president who led his country's peaceful \"velvet revolution\" that toppled communism, has died at the age of 75.\nHavel, who was president from ", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe current and former US secretaries of state were joined by leaders from France, Britain and many ex-communist countries in the cathedral of St Vitus.\nOutside, after church bells rang out across the capital, thousands", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "\nThe current and former US secretaries of state were joined by leaders from France, Britain and many ex-communist countries in the cathedral of St Vitus.

It appears hardly anything. There has only been one other British air strike in Syria - an unmanned Reaper drone firing a Hellfire missile at an IS checkpoint near Raqqa on Christmas Day.\nDespite the vote, the focus of British military action has continued to be on Iraq. The RAF's much lauded brimstone missile has not yet even been fired over Syria.\nThe prime minister's claim that the RAF would make a \"meaningful difference\" there has yet to be borne out.\nSo far more than 90% of the air strikes inside Syria have been conducted by the US.\nIt is of course still early days. But given the limited number of UK air strikes it begs the questions: why was the government so keen to expand the air strikes to Syria, and why the agonising over a vote that appears to have changed relatively little?\nIt is worth recalling that David Cameron argued for Britain to join the Syria air strikes.\nHe said it was to deny IS, also known as Isil, a safe haven. \"It is in Syria, in Raqqa, that Isil has its headquarters, and it is from Raqqa that some of the main threats against this country are planned and orchestrated,\" he said.\nHe argued that by authorising British air strikes over Syria, the RAF would be able to take out the \"snake's head\" - the leadership of IS.\nSo why hasn't that happened? The first reason is that Syria has not been the military priority.\nIn Iraq air strikes are making a difference, largely because there is an army to work with on the ground.\nThe recapture of most of Ramadi has been achieved with the help of the RAF. On 18 December it carried out its most sustained bombing campaign over Ramadi and near Mosul - with 22 air strikes over a 24-hour period.\nAnd there are more reasons as to why Iraq, not Syria, will continue to be the focus of the bombing campaign.\nIraq's prime minister has now said his forces will be turning their attention to Mosul.\nEven though the tide appears to be turning in Iraq, the country will still be heavily reliant on Western air power for months, possibly years to come.\nThe fight against IS in Iraq will be hard. But in Syria it will be even tougher.\nThere is still no ground force around which the US-led coalition can rally.\nBefore the parliamentary vote, David Cameron admitted the situation on the ground in Syria was \"complex\".\nBut his assertion that there were about 70,000 Syrian opposition fighters, who did not belong to extremists groups, still seems fanciful.\nDay-by-day the so-called \"moderate rebels\" are being targeted by Russian aircraft determined to bolster President Assad's position.\nThe battle lines in Syria are blurred and constantly shifting. And it is much harder to conduct an air campaign without eyes on the ground.\nHowever, it would be wrong to give the impression that Syria is being completely ignored.\nOn 19 December the US-led coalition carried out its largest ever pre-planned attack on oil installations near Raqqa, dropping 140 bombs and missiles in a single day (in the coalition daily update this was listed as just one air strike as it involved one target).\nThe US has also been going after senior figures: 10 so-called \"high-value targets\" have been killed over the past month alone.\nThe coalition spokesman, US Colonel Steve Warren, said: \"We are striking at the head of this snake, but we haven't severed it yet, and it's still got fangs.\"\nThe US has been flying combat missions over Syria for more than a year now.\nIt has had more than 100 aircraft gathering intelligence and finding targets (it is costing the US $11m - \u00c2\u00a37.4m - a day to fight this war).\nThis might, in part, explain why the RAF has carried out relatively few air strikes against the \"head of the snake\" in Syria. It often requires weeks, even months, of surveillance.\nBut Britain's very limited involvement in Syria, along with its limited number of aircraft, still raises questions and doubts.\nIs the UK really making a \"meaningful difference\"? Or was the vote on 2 December as much to do with politics as military effect?\nSyria has been embroiled in a bloody armed conflict for nearly five years. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed, and 11 million made homeless.\nWhat started as pro-democracy Arab Spring protests in 2011 spiralled into a civil war between President Bashar al-Assad's government forces and opposition supporters.\nIn the chaos, jihadist group IS moved in over the border from Iraq and claimed territory. The US, Russia, France and other world powers have entered the fray, adding to an already complex web.\nSyria: The story of the conflict", "summary": "It is now a month since MPs voted in support of UK military action against the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Syria.", "id": "35166971", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1.

So is she anxious about President Trump's views on homosexuality?\nIn America some gay people have expressed fears about policies which might be put forward.\n\"Who knows what may emerge?\" says the 60-year-old. \"But for now, Donald Trump seems to have a ton of gay friends he's okay with - especially if they're white and gay.\n\"My worry is what would happen if he were indicted or impeached or gotten rid of. Then we'd have [vice president] Mike Pence in charge, and he tried to pass bills [as governor] in the state of Indiana which were just outrageous.\n\"If Pence were in the White House I would worry about policies relating to gay people.\"\n\"It's wonderful we're appearing in a work by one of America's greatest gay writers,\" Jones continues. \"But like Michael, part of me feels a traitor for being away and enjoying myself.\n\"At the end of the run, I look forward to going back and getting to work.\"\nThe Glass Menagerie is at the Duke of York's Theatre in London until 29 April.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

They've got a bit more of a contemporary edge to them.\"\nHorrocks chose the songs along with her partner, screenwriter Nick Vivian, who she describes as \"a human Spotify\".\nThe set list - which mixes singles with lesser-known album tracks - features Joy Division's Atrocity Exhibition and Isolation, Buzzcocks' Fiction Romance and What Do I Get? and The Human League's Empire State Human.\nOther songs include Soft Cell's Memorabilia, The Smiths' I Know It's Over, New Order's Temptation and Morrissey's Life Is a Pigsty.\nHorrocks admits that the first record she bought was from a very different genre.\n\"I think it was David Essex. My mum and dad's music tastes influenced me massively - like Shirley Bassey and big-band stuff like Count Basie. My brother was a massive influence too - he had contemporary tastes like David Bowie and Marc Bolan and then punk and post-punk stuff. I had those musical genres running in conjunction.\"\nHorrocks says she was always attracted to \"torch song singers\" like Ian Curtis, Morrissey and Marc Almond.\n\"Ian Curtis's and Morrissey's lyrics are amazing - they are proper poets. A lot of Ian Curtis's lyrics you can't actually hear, so I thought it would be nice to hear them clearly, as you can in our version of Isolation.\"\nThe concept for the show sprang from Horrocks's wish to combine a narrative with songs in a way that didn't make it a traditional musical. She took the idea to the Young Vic's artistic director David Lan, who was keen to develop it.\nThe result, described by Lan as \"part dance piece, part gig\", is directed and choreographed by Aletta Collins. The on-stage band features Rat Scabies from punk icons The Damned on drums.\n\"It's a love story that starts out a bit cynical but has a happier ending,\" says Horrocks. \"There's a little bit of dialogue.\"\nGiven that the songs take centre stage, why put it in a theatre and not a gig venue?\n\"I wanted it to be a theatrical experience with a proper set,\" says Horrocks. \"Bunny Christie's design is very rock'n'roll but it's very theatrical as well.\n\"The team are all theatre-based but they are thinking in a gig mode. Everybody is being taken out of their comfort zone.

Snail justice ends up benefitting the rich as witnesses can be intimidated and bought and political pressure and money power can be used to influence and subdue prosecutors and sometimes judges.\nIt took 13 years for a court in Mumbai to convict actor Salman Khan of culpable homicide and sentence him to five years in prison despite prosecution witnesses turning hostile. But it took two days for an appeals court to suspend the sentence and grant him bail. It helped that Khan had access to some of the best and most expensive lawyers. India has over a million registered lawyers, but a large number of them graduate with dubious degrees from indifferent law schools, are poorly educated and, according to lawyer-turned-journalist Kian Ganz, \"effectively operate as fixers... hawking for work outside small claims courts or as notaries\".\nAfter 18 years, a court last September found former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayaram Jayalalitha guilty of amassing unaccounted-for-wealth and sentenced her to four years. Some seven months later, on Monday, an appeals court cleared her of corruption charges, saying that the trial court had \"exaggerated\" her wealth.\nThe case was moved from Tamil Nadu to neighbouring Karnataka to ensure a fair trial, but that doesn't appear to have helped matters. As Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy pointed out, the high court in Karnataka examined the same evidence and said in its 919-page ruling \"repeatedly that the acquittal was a failure of the prosecution\".\nIt took six years for a court in April to declare B Ramalinga Raju, former head of Satyam Computers, guilty of criminal conspiracy and cheating and sentenced him to seven years in jail. A month later, on Monday, the appeals court accepted a defence plea that he had spent 35 months in jail, a \"substantial part\" of his term, and granted him bail after suspending his sentence.\nTo be sure, the three rulings really do not mark any sea change and have just happened to come around the same time. It is also true that India's higher courts routinely revoke orders of lower trial courts. For years politicians have evaded corruption charges and the rich and famous have escaped criminal liability through \"high-priced lawyering\".\nAt the same time, many believe, the recent rulings are - again - an indictment of India's ailing and unfair justice system which is heavily loaded against the poor, and shabby investigation by the police.\nThousands of undertrials languish in Indian prisons for lesser offences unable to afford bail. Judges are also often blamed for being anti-poor. After the Supreme Court granted bail to Jayalalitha last year, Supreme Court lawyer Rajeev Dhavan wrote tellingly about bail discrimination: \"Bail for as many is good, but applying it differentially is not. We do not have clear principles to guide bail decisions - especially in post-conviction cases, where judges look at the crime and behave totally with subjective arbitrariness against the poor.\"\nThe recent rulings reminded me of a highly acclaimed recent indie film called Court - possibly the best Indian film of the year so far - which astutely skewers the country's discriminatory and outdated justice system. A part-time teacher and social activist is hauled to a court on  trumped up charges of instigating a sewage worker to kill himself after listening to one of the activist's incendiary songs. The case grinds on in drab courtrooms with no end in sight, and effectively destroys the activist.\nOf course, as Nick Robinson, a fellow at the Harvard Law School's Program on the Legal Profession and at Delhi's Centre for Policy Research, tells me, there are often good judges trying to do the right thing. \"But politics and money is so embedded in the system that it clearly tilts the deck in favour of the powerful,\" he says. \"I also think some judges worry that if they are seen as overly-punitive on those with power, then there might be a backlash against them impacting their careers or the authority of the judiciary.\"\nIndia needs more judges, more and better educated lawyers and a thorough repair of what academics Devesh Kapur and Milan Vaishnav call the \"dilapidated and clogged\" plumbing of its courts.

The France 3 film was poignantly entitled Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13.\nThe question for France is whether their deaths will help change the way bullying is tackled.\nIt starts so gradually, you hardly notice it.\nIn a classroom of rowdy students, Marion is marked out as one of the good girls.\nOver the course of the 90-minute drama, she loses her friends, is the victim of rumours, insults and isolation, and then is cornered by a group of boys in the corridor, who grab her, pin her down and throw her shoes away.\n\"She was asking for it,\" says a passing girl. Marion breaks down and cries. From there the drama follows her descent into desperation, depression, and finally suicide.\nThe film was adapted from a book by Marion's mother, Nora, who found a letter from the teenager after her death and decided to tell her story.\nA poignant act, because one of the most striking elements of that story is how Marion's parents knew about what was happening to their daughter at the time.\nInterviewed by a French newspaper to mark the launch of the dramatisation, actress Julie Gayet, who plays Nora, said the film had two points of view: Marion's and her mother's.\nThe script \"shows that parents never really know their child. Half a child's life escapes them\".\nMore than four million people tuned in to watch the drama, which was followed by a one-hour debate. Many took to social media afterwards to share their stories and express their anger.\n\"It's not a suicide, it's murder,\" wrote one Twitter user, called Sara. Another suggested that the film be shown in schools.  Others wrote of their own experiences of bullying, with some saying the experience had haunted them for years after they had left full-time education.\nRead more here:\nAccording to official figures, 700,000 pupils are bullied each year in France, and activists say more than 90% of children have access to social networks.\nFrance has tried to improve awareness of bullying in schools, as well as support for the victims.\nIn 2014, a new anti-bullying law was brought in, and a hotline set up for pupils to report incidents. But activists say France is still not tackling the problem effectively.\n\"The authorities' response is improving very slowly,\" says psychologist and campaigner Catherine Verdier. \"But France is dragging behind other countries. If you look at Finland, Sweden, where it's a national cause, there was a real impulse from the top to change things.\"\n\"A few schools have improved, but not enough,\" says Willy Pierre who runs 'You Are Heroes', set up after Marion's death to break the taboo around bullying. \"The hotline is only open in school hours, and it can take weeks or months to find a designated adult for the child to talk to face to face.\"\nThe problem has also grown to encompass cyber-bullying and harassment outside the school gates. The solution, he says, is for parents, teachers and pupils to talk openly about the problem.\nEmilie was four years older than Marion when she died in January after jumping out of a window at her father's house.\nA bright pupil at a private school in the northern city of Lille, Emilie's parents say she endured years of terror up to the age of 13 because she was not considered cool and trendy and loved reading.\nEventually she snapped and they pulled her out of the school. For three years she tried other schools and distance learning, but she developed a phobia of schools and her parents believe her death was linked to depression as a result of the bullying.\nDodging blows, being tripped up and spat at.

I've played well against both of them before on the grass, so that's a positive.\"\nShould Murray fail to win his second singles match, the tie would come down to a fifth and final rubber between James Ward and either Gasquet, Tsonga or Mahut.\nBritain won their ninth and most recent Davis Cup back in 1936 under the inspirational leadership of Fred Perry, and last made the final in 1978.\nThe prize on offer on Sunday is a semi-final against Kazakhstan or Australia, with the Kazakhs leading 2-1 heading into the final day in Darwin.\nOn the other side of the draw, Belgium have seen off a Canada side without Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil, while Argentina beat a Serbia side missing Novak Djokovic.\nMahut did not speak, Tsonga managed a weak smile of resignation and team captain Arnaud Clement just about retained his game face.\nThe mood in the French camp was clear when they faced the media after the defeat.\n\"We will talk about tomorrow a little bit later,\" was Clement's response when asked whether the official singles line-up of Simon and Tsonga will remain unchanged.\n\"For us it is difficult to be 2-1 down and it's a great advantage for Great Britain now.\n\"Tomorrow is going to be a very difficult day for us, but we're going to try as hard as we can.

How will the Bengali community in Tower Hamlets, many of whom voted for Mr Rahman, react? What will the judgement's impact be on community cohesion?\nAnd for the government - should the Law Commission be asked to look at making it easier to challenge elections if there is a suspicion of fraud?\nIt took four local individuals in this case to risk a legal bill of hundreds of thousands of pounds to get this election overturned.\nThe re-run poll is likely to be on either the 7 or 11 June.\nMr Rahman ran a \"ruthless and dishonest campaign to convince the electorate his rival John Biggs was a racist\", Mr Mawrey said.\nAfter the ruling, Labour London Assembly member, Mr Biggs, said Mr Rahman and his allies had \"robbed the people of Tower Hamlets of the free and fair mayoral election they deserved and betrayed everyone in our community who trusted and voted for him\".\nThe group of voters who brought the action was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor. He said it was \"a fantastic result for democracy\".\nThe four voters mounted the legal challenge under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.\nTheir lawyers made a series of allegations, including \"personation\" in postal voting and at polling stations and ballot paper tampering.\nThe Election Commissioner upheld a number of the allegations, including:\nLawyers for Mr Rahman, who was re-elected for Tower Hamlets First last May, described the claims as \"invention\", \"exaggeration\" and \"in some cases downright deliberately false allegations\".\nThe Election Judgement said Mr Choudhury, who was also found guilty of illegal practices, must immediately vacate his seat as a councillor and a new by-election must be held in the Stepney ward.\nIn a statement, Tower Hamlets First said: \"The Mayor strongly denies any wrongdoing and had full confidence in the justice system and so this result has been surprising to say the least.\"\nCommunities Secretary Eric Pickles said the Election Court's judgement justified his decision to send commissioners into the council last year to take over some operations.\nHe said: \"This judgement vindicates our action to intervene.\"\nHe added the judgement against Mr Rahman could mean extra powers being handed to commissioners.\nThe Met Police said it takes allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice extremely seriously and would take time to consider the election judgement.\nSpeaking to BBC London 94.9, former London mayor, Ken Livingston, said he found the result of the Election Court \"worrying\".\nHe said: \"Let's wait and see if he is convicted of anything.

Documents, it is claimed, have been deliberately leaked in order to destabilise the man elected to the top job in world football in February.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFifa has been hit by a spate of high profile departures in recent months.\nDomenico Scala resigned as Fifa's head audit and compliance in May while the governing body's one time finance director and acting secretary general, Markus Kattner, was sacked that same month amid allegations of financial impropriety.\nKattner was fired after the discovery of a secret bonus scheme which paid him millions of dollars over a period of years.\nA number of other employees have left, or are expected to leave, following a major restructuring within Fifa's Zurich headquarters.\nA further 18 potential witnesses are understood to have been questioned as part of the preliminary probe into Infantino.\nTorres is said to be leading the investigation given that the chairman of the ethics investigatory chamber, Cornel Borbely, and Infantino are both Swiss nationals.\nThe interview by investigators follows the leaking, to German media, of an internal Fifa memo.\nInfantino was alleged by an unnamed Fifa insider to have used private jets during a trip to visit the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar, raising questions of a potential conflict of interest.\nFifa organised the flight to Moscow but an airline transfer to Doha was not available following a late change in the schedule by his Russian hosts.\nInfantino and his staff then travelled by private jet, arranged by the Russians. The Gulf state in turn organised the return trip to Switzerland.\nThere have also been reports in Swiss and German media that Infantino, after attending the Champions League Final in Milan in May, flew on to Rome for an audience with the Pope. He then returned to Geneva.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut sources say that flight will be argued not to be a breach of Fifa's code of ethics given it was a private arrangement with a family friend who is unconnected to football.\nThe leaked internal document also alleges that Infantino demanded Fifa hire an external driver, who then billed the governing body for driving Infantino's family and advisors around while he was abroad.\nIt also details costs authorised by Infantino of:\n\u2022\u00a38,795 for mattresses at his home\n\u2022\u00a36,829 on a stepper exercise machine\n\u2022\u00a31,086 for a tuxedo\n\u2022\u00a3677 on flowers\n\u2022\u00a3132 on personal laundry\nIt also makes reference to how many of the candidates chosen by Infantino to fill senior posts had not passed the relevant eligibility checks, including the new Fifa secretary general, Fatma Samoura.\nBut Infantino believes the case will be dismissed given the relevant facts.\nFor example, it's understood Infantino wanted a bed removed from an office space previously occupied by Sepp Blatter. The former Fifa president is understood to have been partial to an afternoon nap on occasion.\nIn its place Infantino asked for a step machine, with an expectation one would be brought in from Fifa's on-site gymnasium.\nInstead, officials purchased a new one with the resultant invoice being used by Infantino's enemies, according to sources, to damage him.\nThe Swiss-Italian is also under pressure for failing to sign an employment contract, with reports of a dispute between him and Scala, who helped set pay levels, over his salary.\nA spokesman for Fifa's investigatory chamber declined to comment \"on possible preliminary investigations.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.", "summary": "Fifa president Gianni Infantino is to be interviewed by ethics investigators following allegations he breached the governing body's code of ethics.", "id": "36795446", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nInfantino 'confident' of Fifa ethics probe dismissal\nInfantino 'confident' of Fifa ethics probe dismissal 12:00\nInfantino 'confident' of F", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nInfantino 'confident' of Fifa ethics probe dismissal\nInfantino 'confident' of Fifa ethics probe dismissal 12:00\nInfantino 'confident' of F", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nInfantino 'very confident' of Fifa ethics probe clearance\nInfantino 'very confident' of Fifa ethics probe clearance 02:00\nInfantino 'very confident' of F", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nInfantino 'confident' of Fifa ethics probe clearance\nInfantino 'confident' of Fifa ethics probe clearance 02:00\nInfantino 'confident' of F", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nInfantino 'very confident' of Fifa ethics probe clearance\nInfantino 'very confident' of Fifa ethics probe clearance 02:00\nInfantino 'very confident' of F", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nBBC Sport has learned Infantino will meet Robert Torres, a member of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee.

So just what is driving the relationship between sterling and the euro at the moment?\nThe first thing to say is that it is primarily about euro strength rather than pound weakness.\nSimon Derrick, chief currency strategist at financial institution BNY Mellon, reckons there have been two key factors recently which have stoked the euro's strength.\nThe first was that earlier in the year, there was a lot of political uncertainty in the eurozone, not least about the outcome of the French presidential election, and that drove the euro lower.\nThe National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, wanted France to abandon the euro - a move which could have caused turmoil in the eurozone - and even the European Union as a whole.\nHowever, when it became clear that Emmanuel Macron was likely to win, \"a lot of the political concerns started to dissipate\", says Mr Derrick.\n\"As political tensions eased, it made the currency look rather more attractive.\"\nAnother \"significant factor\" boosting the euro is anticipation on the markets that the European Central Bank will start cutting back on its Quantitative Easing programme, says Mr Derrick.\nThis has seen it pumping 60bn euros a month into the eurozone economy, in an effort to bolster its performance.\nEssentially, that has meant huge amounts of euros sloshing around the system, keeping the value of the euro down.\nHowever, if that changes, then the pressure on the euro will be lifted.\nIt's a question of supply and demand.\n\"The market has this expectation that at some point between now and the end of the year, the ECB will say something about further reducing the QE programme and as a result, the euro's been going up,\" says Mr Derrick.\nNot only because it will mean less money in the system, but also because it will be a sign that the ECB thinks the eurozone economy can manage without so much support.\nThere's a flip side to the relationship, of course: what's happening to sterling.\nAhead of August's Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting, some people had been wondering if there would be signs that more members of the committee were in favour of raising interest rates.\nWhen it became clear that wasn't the case, people were disappointed. That put pressure on sterling, because lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to foreign investors, explains Mr Derrick.\nIn addition, forthcoming political events are causing uncertainty for the pound.\nMr Derrick points to \"potential stumbling blocks along the way for sterling\".  He highlights the start of the next round of negotiations between the UK and the EU over Brexit, and the Conservative party conference, among other things.\nHowever, he is unwilling to stick his neck out and predict whether and when the pound and euro will reach parity.\nHe concedes it's \"possible\" the pound could reach 1.05 to 1.06 euros  before the end of the year.\nTake a look online at some of the currency exchanges. At the moment, travellers can get about 1.0600 to 1.0836 euros for their pound, depending on how much you're changing and who you're doing it with.\nBut if the predictions are correct that the exchange rate is going to get worse for Brits, then those deals might start to seem quite attractive.", "summary": "The holiday season is in full swing.", "id": "40896987", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "the pound is weakening against the euro.\nThe pound is weakening against the euro.\nThe pound is weakening against the euro.

The singer promptly denied it.\nLife on a White House staff is intense and exhausting.\nThis administration is under particular pressure, given the ongoing Russia investigation, recent legislative setbacks and a president who can be, shall we say, occasionally off-message. Now cracks in the structure are beginning to show.\nSean Spicer's departure, reportedly because he doesn't want to work for newly named communication director Anthony Scaramucci, represents the most significant shakeup within the administration's senior team to date.

A month later, the president said: \"He's doing a good job but he gets beat up.\"\nMr Spicer was roundly mocked after he reportedly hid by a hedgerow on the White House grounds to avoid reporters on the night Mr Trump fired the FBI director in May.\nHis last on-camera briefing was on 20 June, and there have been few since then.\nMembers of the media have accused the Trump administration of attempting to kill off the daily news conferences to avoid scrutiny.", "summary": "White House press secretary Sean Spicer has moved to minimise talk of divisions within the Trump administration after announcing his resignation.", "id": "40690501", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\"The Trump administration has been rife with personal feuds, as various factions vie for a mercurial president's ear.

Since then use has risen, reaching 54,419 uses in the week beginning 4 April 2016 and 53,644 in the week beginning 11 April, the last week of figures released.\nThe figures released by Monitor under the Freedom of Information Act suggest that, as the limit has come down, more staff have been affected.\nThe cap on pay for agency and locum staff was in response to hospitals \"over-spending\" on temporary workers.\nThe chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, said in 2015 that he wanted to see the \u00a31.8bn spent on agency and contract staff the year before turned into \"good, paying permanent jobs\". And he accused staffing agencies of \"ripping off\" the NHS.\nRising use of agency workers was partly down to hospitals putting more nurses on wards in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal, Mr Stevens said. The official report into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust identified a key reason for inadequate care was a lack of nurses.\nHowever, the Royal College of Nursing says the NHS has not taken on enough student nurses to meet demand, resulting in agencies filling the vacuum and charging more to do so.\nThe health regulator NHS Improvement said hospitals in England were 15,000 short of the required number of nurses.\nFigures obtained by the BBC in February 2016 showed there were more than 23,000 nursing vacancies in the NHS in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - about 9% of the workforce. That compares with a typical vacancy rate across all forms of work of 2.7%.\nDetails of each trust's use of the clause are recorded anonymously.\nIn the last week for which figures were available one hospital trust used the clause 1,310 times. Nursing, midwifery and health visitor staff made up 759 of those. Four other trusts also used the clause more than 1,000 times in the same week. Only 18 trusts did not use the clause at all in the week beginning 11 April.\nJanet Davies, chief executive of the RCN, said: \"Agency cap breaches are a barometer of the scale of the NHS's workforce problem, and it shows clearly that the problem is getting worse.\n\"NHS Trusts are unable to recruit nurses and are rightly prioritising patient safety over sticking to the cap.\n\"This is a workforce planning issue. The number of nurses being trained in the UK has been reduced, for short-term financial reasons.\"\nA spokeswoman for NHS Improvement said the cap had saved up to \u00a3300m since October.\nShe added: \"We know that trusts will need to override the cap where patient safety is a concern and it's important that they are able to do that. But as the new rules set in, whilst overrides did increase temporarily, they have begun to steadily decline as we expected.\n\"Overuse of agencies is bad for patients, bad for the NHS and unfair on other staff. These measures will help those staff currently working in agencies to come back into the NHS. Average prices paid for agency nurses have fallen by around 11% since October, so NHS nurses can be assured that their agency colleagues aren't being paid over the odds for doing the same job.\"\nThe biggest use of the clause came in a week when one of the junior doctors' strikes took place.\nHowever, figures for other weeks when doctors were on strike in the long-running dispute over new contracts do not suggest a link as they were either less than the week before or rose in line with a general trend.", "summary": "Rules on the amount hospitals can pay agency staff are being flouted

accused of tax fraud.\nThe forward, with the Portugal squad in Russia, signed a new five-year contract in November 2016, but has been linked with a return to Manchester United.\n\"The only thing I can say is Cristiano Ronaldo is a Real Madrid player,\" said Perez, who was re-elected on Monday.\nSpanish prosecutors have accused Ronaldo of defrauding the authorities of millions of euros in tax, which he has denied.\n\"Obviously something has happened, something has affected him, his credibility,\" Perez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. \"I'm sure he will tell us and we will see.\n\"It's no

It hasn't finished yet and I don't want to disturb the Portuguese team.\n\"He just wants to be the best player in the world.

This is very strange and in the next few days I'll talk to him.\n\"I must defend him at all costs, both as a player and as a person. What I will say is that everyone must fulfil their tax obligations. I have no doubt that Cristiano will be able to defend himself.\n\"What they have told me is that he has the same financial arrangements as he had in England, where he had no problems.\"\nRonaldo is said to be \"upset\" after being accused of tax fraud and wants to leave, a source close to the player told the BBC.\nHe is accused of evading tax to the value of 14.7m euros (\u00a313m; $16m) between 2011 and 2014.\nReal Madrid released a statement saying they had \"full confidence\" in their player, and they were convinced he would prove his innocence.\nRonaldo's discontent has alerted clubs all over the world but he has been linked most strongly with a return to United, or a transfer to PSG.\nBut the Portuguese would be costly - his Real contract has a 1bn euro (\u00a3874.88m) release clause.\nIn 2009, Perez - then in his second spell at the club - signed Ronaldo for Real for a then world-record fee of \u00a380m.\nThe forward had helped United win three Premier League titles and the Champions League in his six years at the club, and had also won the Ballon d'Or.\nHe was presented at the Bernabeu in front of 80,000 fans, as Perez attempted to bring together a second group of 'Galacticos'.\nEight years on, Ronaldo has scored a club-record 406 goals in 394 appearances.\nOnly two weeks ago, he helped Real win their 12th European Cup, scoring twice in a 4-1 victory over Juventus in the Champions League final in Cardiff.\nVictory meant Real became the first team to win back-to-back Champions League titles, with Ronaldo the competition's record goalscorer with 105.\nA two-time La Liga winner, his 285 goals in 265 league appearances mean he is second only to Barcelona's Lionel Messi in that competition.\nHe won the Ballon d'Or award for a fourth time in December and signed a new deal with Real in November, saying he could continue playing for another 10 years\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone\nIt was billed as Florentino Perez addressing the Ronaldo issue, but when Real Madrid's newly re-elected president gave a round of media interviews, the content was much the same - effectively 'I don't know what is going on'.\nHe did say Ronaldo is under contract, but everyone knows that. He also said he needed to speak to the Portuguese but, with the Confederations Cup in Russia under way, now was not a good time.\nThis was a politician's way of addressing a hot topic. Talking but saying nothing.\nIt merely adds to the air of uncertainty. Does Ronaldo really want to leave Real, or is he angling after a better deal?\nDoes he want to move back to Manchester United or is his preference Paris St-Germain?\nFor all the words written and spoken about the four-time Champions League winner, the only people who really know are Ronaldo himself and long-time adviser Jorge Mendes.\nThey will have the final say.

This could enable President Erdogan to stay in power until 2029.\nHis narrow victory was ruled valid by Turkey's electoral body, despite claims of irregularities by the opposition.\nOn Monday, Turkey extended the state of emergency for three months. The measure, introduced after a failed coup last July, was set to expire in two days.\nThe call from Donald Trump was pre-arranged and the focus was Syria - but the congratulations for President Erdogan's victory means the US president joins leaders from Qatar, Guinea, Djibouti and the Palestinian militant movement Hamas to voice the opinion, while those in Europe have been far more cautious.\nIt will delight Erdogan supporters, who will see it as legitimising the president's victory. But it will dismay opponents, after Mr Erdogan's fiery tirades against the West and the damning verdict of international observers.\nIt also exposes a split between the EU and US on Turkey: Mr Trump opting for realpolitik while Europe urges the unpredictable Turkish leader to reconcile a divided country.\nAnd it will reiterate similarities between Presidents Trump and Erdogan on issues like democratic norms and press freedom - though the Turkish president has of course dealt with them in a far more extreme way.\nUltimately, President Trump was perhaps aiming to win favour in Ankara, given that the two sides have fundamental disagreements over Syria.\nSyria is one of the issues straining relations between Washington and Ankara.\nTurkey is irked by the policy started by the Obama administration of supporting Kurdish fighters in Syria who are fighting so-called Islamic State.\nTurkey views the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) as a terror group linked to Kurdish separatists waging an insurgency inside Turkey since 1984.\nTurkey - a key Nato ally - has established closer co-operation with Russia recently.\nThe two sides are also at loggerheads over Fethullah Gulen. Turkey accuses the Pennsylvania-based cleric of orchestrating the failed coup and wants him extradited.\nOfficially Washington insists any decision on returning him to Turkey from the US remains a judicial rather than a political one.\nMr Trump's comments contrasted with a statement by the US state department which mentioned concerns by international observers and urged Turkey to respect the rights of its citizens - chiming with sentiment in European capitals.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the \"tight referendum result shows how deeply divided Turkish society is and that means a big responsibility for the Turkish leadership and for President Erdogan personally\".\nThe European Commission issued a similar call.\nOthers expressed concern about the possibility of the return of capital punishment.\nThe French president's office warned that any referendum on reviving the death penalty would \"obviously be a break with values and engagements\" that Turkey had accepted in joining the Council of Europe. The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, tweeted his own concerns.\nAustrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz went further. He said the referendum result was a \"clear signal against the European Union\". The \"fiction\" of Turkey's bid to join the bloc must be ended, Mr Kurz said.\nDespite saying that the voting day was \"well administered\", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe criticised the referendum campaign, and the Council of Europe said the vote \"did not live up\" its standards.\nThe monitors also criticised a late change by electoral officials that allowed voting papers without official stamps to be counted. But the head of Turkey's electoral body, Sadi Guven, said the unstamped ballot papers had been produced by the High Electoral Board and were valid. He said a similar procedure had been used in past elections.\nBut the Turkish Bar Association described the move as \"illegal\".\nAnd Austrian MP Alev Korun - one of the Council of Europe observers - said \"there is a suspicion that up to 2.5 million votes could have been manipulated\" - which would have changed the result. She offered no evidence.\nMr Erdogan told supporters that Turkey did not \"see, hear or acknowledge the politically motivated reports\" of the monitors.\nThe result, he said, ended the debate on changing the constitution and creating an executive presidency, adding that the process of implementing the reforms would now begin.\nRead more: Erdogan's rise to power\nHe also said the country could hold a referendum on its long-stalled EU membership bid.\nAdditionally, Mr Erdogan said he would approve the death penalty if it was supported in a referendum or a bill was submitted to him through parliament.

the least expensive ever bowled by England in a T20 international.\nNew Zealand entered the match having won all four of their group matches, and 12 of their last 13 in global tournaments.\nBut - just as in the World Cup final, when they froze at the Melbourne Cricket Ground - they appeared to be undone by a change of location, as they failed to adapt from the low-scoring conditions in which they had played their previous games to Delhi's more batsman-friendly track.\nThe Black Caps had defended scores of 126, 142 and 145 earlier in the tournament, but England had broken the back of the chase in amassing 49-0 by the time Williamson turned to his leading wicket-taker Mitchell Santner after four overs.\nNew Zealand's defeat means that they miss out on a first World Twenty20 final, and ensures that the record of no side ever having won the tournament undefeated will continue.\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"I don't think it could have been much better. Maybe we would have liked to start better with the ball, but we did well to peg it back.\n\"Making a final is the kind of thing you dream of as a kid.

For Project Brave to succeed, clubs need to buy into it and implement it.\n\"People have in the main agreed that something radical needs to be done,\" Mackay said. \"And this is radical.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhat the clubs are agreeing with is the establishment of a reserve league and an under-18 league, encouraging more development loans, a summer calendar for academy football (with indoor futsal taking place in the winter) and coach development, with a head of coaching to be appointed to lead the development of the best coaches at each club.\n\"This whole programme is based on coaches,\" Mackay explained. \"Our coach education programme is second to none. What we're not good at is coach mentoring.\n\"I'm going to ask the clubs to give me their best young coach and I'll put on a course for them, we'll set them tasks, have them for a year thinking deeply about certain problems, make our good young coaches very good young coaches.\n\"Clubs want that to happen and we need to for our next Scotland managers. Everybody we've spoken to is up for this. We need to make the [coaches] better to make our players better.\n\"The part that comes up is money, funding.\"\nSome clubs were initially wary of the prospect of the academy system being streamlined. The plan is to reduce the number of funded elite academies from 29 to a maximum of 16.\nClubs will need to submit a three-year business plan to show that their academy is financially viable, has enough support staff and coaches and good enough facilities. Academies will also be judged on measurable performance outcomes, including the number of graduates in the first team, the number actively out on loan at other clubs and the number representing the national team.\nAll of this will be assessed by an independent company and the selected elite academies will receive funding but also play each other in a competitive league to maintain the best v best strategy.\nOther clubs will still be able to run academies or community outreach schemes. All will continue to receive their current level of funding for three years after Project Brave is implemented, a commitment that has won a lot of support for the plan.\n\"There is a soft landing for clubs, there is a lot of support and help going to be given,\" Mackay said.\n\"We are setting the bar high because it has to be the elite players we're focusing on. It's the 19-21 age group where the whole thing breaks down and we need to get them into first teams.\n\"It's up to us to educate 11-16-year-olds. We need to be better athletes and have them running properly at that age, proper sports science, diet and nutrition advice, to be under 10% body fat and sports psychology to make sure they are mentally stronger. We need to build better footballers.\"\nTalent identification will be a key factor, particularly when clubs will have to reduce the number of players in their academy. Mackay will establish a talent identification programme at the SFA to assist clubs in predicting which players will make the grade at 19 by measuring and assessing physical and mental markers as they develop.\n\"It's imperative for Scottish football,\" he said.\nOnce Mackay has completed his presentations the next stage of the process is for Project Brave to be presented to the SFA board. Following that, and once the clubs have signed off on it, the plans will begin to be implemented in time for season 2017-18.\n\"It's about what is the best for the young Scottish elite player,\" Mackay added.\nMackay has begun the process of making the case for Project Brave, and so far he has been encouraged by the reaction.

The poor quality relates to all three of the following aspects:\n\"All three issues were ultimately the responsibility of the design and build contractor in charge of the site.\"\nThe report said it was not the result of an isolated case of a rogue bricklayer.\nIt said the substandard brick-laying was either not inspected or was ignored, that an appropriate level of independent scrutiny was missing; and that having a clerk of works may have made a difference.\nMr Cole also questions whether the drive for faster, lower-cost construction is to the detriment of quality and safety.\nThe report said the fundamental weakness was the lack of proper scrutiny of building work by the council and Edinburgh Schools Partnership, which managed the PPP contract.\nThe report also said: \"There was an over-reliance on the part of the council, without adequate evidence, that others in the project structure, including those building the schools would comprehensively fulfil this essential role.\"\nThe report also concluded that the finance model was not responsible for defective construction.\nMr Cole also highlighted a failure to properly store and maintain the relevant documents.\nHe said closing the schools had been the only practical and safe course of action, and that finding alternative arrangements for more than 7,600 pupils was a \"remarkable feat\". The impact on the children's education had been \"relatively limited\".\nHis report was originally expected by the end of 2016, but was delayed by several weeks after Mr Cole was advised that any organisation or individual criticised in the investigation must be given time to respond.\nThe schools affected by the closures were all built or refurbished as part of the same public private partnership scheme.\nThey were built by Miller Construction, which was acquired by Galliford Try in 2014.\nCity of Edinburgh Council said it was drawing up an action plan to ensure confidence in the safety of all its buildings.\nAn Edinburgh Schools Partnership spokesman said: \"We have fully cooperated with the council and Professor Cole in trying to establish the facts of what happened with the schools affected.\n\"Having only just received a copy of the report, we will now take time to consider its findings in detail before commenting further.\"\nAndrew Kerr, City of Edinburgh Council's chief executive, said: \"The report pulls no punches and makes clear what went wrong, the reasons for it and where responsibility lay.\n\"Clearly there are lessons for the council and I will now be drawing up an action plan to take our recommendations forward to ensure everyone can have confidence in the safety of all of our buildings.\n\"The council, our public and private sector partners both in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, need to take on board the issues raised and address the concerns highlighted in the report as they have far-reaching implications for the construction industry.\"\nKevin Stewart, Minister for Housing and Local Government, said: \"The safety of people in public buildings is an absolute priority and I am very concerned by some of the findings highlighted in this report.\"\nLarry Flanagan, EIS General Secretary, said: \"This report issues a stark warning - to Edinburgh, to local authorities and to all those responsible for the construction and maintenance of our schools - that they must take action to ensure that all buildings are well-designed, properly-built and maintained to an extremely high standard.\n\"This is not an area where corners or costs should ever be cut.\n\"The legacy of the PPP/PFI funding model is too many inferior buildings, for which we will all be paying a vastly inflated price for decades to come.

{"document": "Official figures for the first quarter of 2014 showed sanctions on Employment and Support Allowance claimants were some 4.5 times higher than in the same quarter in 2013 - although the 2014 figure still includes those appealing.\nUnder the sanctions, benefits can be docked temporarily.\nMinisters said they were a last resort.\nEmployment and Support Allowance (ESA) was introduced in 2008 to replace incapacity benefit.\nIt is intended for people who are unable to work due to sickness or disability. Claimants undergo tests, called work capability assessments, before learning whether they are eligible for the payment.\nSome of those deemed eligible for the payment are given regular interviews to help them find work, depending on their level of disability.\nIn the first three months of 2014, there were 15,955 sanctions on ESA claimants, compared with 3,574 in the same period last year.\nOnly ESA claimants in the work-related activity group, where an adviser assists them with training and skills, can be subject to sanctions, which are handed out for failing to attend a mandatory interview or failing to take part in a work-related activity.\nThere are 552,000 benefit claimants in the ESA work-related activity group and they receive up to \u00c2\u00a3101.15 a week, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said.\nMatt Downie, director of policy and external affairs at Crisis, said: \"This is a shocking escalation in the use of sanctions and we are deeply concerned about the impact on people's lives.\n\"Sanctions are cruel and can leave people utterly destitute - without money even for food and at severe risk of homelessness. It is difficult to see how they are meant to help people prepare for work.\n\"Our own research has shown that many homeless people face unfair and inappropriate sanctions, often handed out due to errors on the part of the job centre or work programme provider.\n\"We want the government to commit to an urgent, wide-ranging review looking at the appropriateness and effectiveness of sanctions, especially for people at risk of or experiencing homelessness.\"\nDisability charity Scope said the increase \"raises serious questions\".\nChief executive Richard Hawkes said: \"We back the government's commitment to getting more disabled people into work.\n\"But such a dramatic increase in the use of sanctions raises serious questions.\n\"Disabled people are being sanctioned for things like missing interviews with advisers. How often do sanctions take into account the reality of disabled people's lives?\n\"Interviews with advisers can clash with medical appointments and inaccessible transport can make attendance extremely difficult.\"\nHe called for more advisers with specialist understanding of disabled people's conditions and added: \"We need a system that works for disabled people, that supports them to find a job they want, and that takes seriously the barriers they face.\"\nA Department for Works and Pensions spokeswoman said: \"People who are in a job know that if they don't play by the rules or fail to turn up in the morning, there might be consequences, so it's only right that people on benefits should have similar responsibilities. However, sanctions are used as a last resort.\"\nThe sanctions are temporary and the vast majority last for a week, said the DWP, with about 99% of recipients not receiving sanctions.\nClaimants can apply for hardship payments, which would allow them to receive 60% of their payment for the duration of the sanction. They are also entitled to part of their ESA benefit which is not affected by sanctions, which is \u00c2\u00a328.75, the spokeswoman added.\nThe DWP figures also showed that Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) claimants had benefits suspended 920,000 times in the year up to March 2014.\nA spokeswoman said that around 6% of all JSA claimants receive a sanction, with the most common reason being the benefit claimant failing to actively look for a job.\nThe Liberal Democrats have said too many benefits claimants are unfairly punished and called for a \"yellow card\" system.\nThis proposal, to be included in their general election manifesto, would see jobseekers who breach the terms of their benefits given a warning for a first offence rather than having payments suspended.\nLiberal Democrat Work and Pensions Minister Steve Webb said producing  a card showing details of the issue would help claimants understand what they had to do to keep receiving payments  and seek help from people such as GPs or social workers.\nThe DWP has agreed a series of reforms to the sanctions system after a Government-commissioned review warned of significant inadequacies in official communications with claimants.\nFormer civil servant Matthew Oakley said some only discovered their benefits had been stopped when their bank cards were refused at cash machines and recommended that a guide to benefit sanctions must be easily accessible in hard copy and online.", "summary": "There has been a \"shocking\" rise in the number of sanctions given to those who receive a key sickness benefit, according to homeless charity Crisis.", "id": "28776102", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "1. 4.5 times more sanctions in 2014 than 2013. 2. 4.5 times more sanctions in 2014 than 2013. 3", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "1. 4.5 times more sanctions in 2014 than 2013 2. 920,000 sanctions in 2014 3. 6% of JS", "decode_al_05_be_1_lay_1": "1. 2014: 4.5 times more sanctions than 2013 2. 2014: 4.5 times more sanctions than 2013 3.

It's meant to be all-inclusive. At the moment it's not.\n\"I would have been priced out of football just now.\n\"I grew up in Castlemilk, a housing estate on the south side of Glasgow. Up until I was 15, I thought that was the way everybody grew up.\n\"Crime, heroin, drink - football was my escape route from all of that. Football was important, took me away from an area that was hard growing up in. It gave me something to focus on.\"\nMcLaren is part of a charitable organisation trying to give young people opportunity, particularly through football but in other ways too, in order to tackle the stark disadvantage that simply being born into a certain postcode can bring.\nHe feels the game he loves, which did so much for him, is now leaving those kids behind.\n\"I've been working in these areas for seven, eight years and I think I've seen an SFA coach once,\" he said.\n\"Remember these are areas guys like Kenny Dalglish, Frank McAvennie, Bertie Auld (came from); really we could be missing out on the next Kenny Dalglish because he's not got a fiver a week.\n\"For me that's wrong; it's meant to be our national sport.\"\nThat's the nub of the problem as far as he sees it. Families in these areas simply can't afford to pay for their children to participate in football.\n\"I keep hearing that kids don't want to play football,\" he explained.\n\"Come up and see us on a Friday night or come to one of our camps and see 200-250 boys running about and tell me kids don't want to play football.\n\"People keep telling me that cost isn't an issue - 100% cost is an issue.\n\"We're not getting the same kids from the same areas. Growing up in Castlemilk I genuinely can't remember paying for football. Maybe it was 10 pence or you sold a football card now and again.\n\"People are struggling out there. We started eight years ago and very quickly we'd see young people with holes in their shoes and things like that.\n\"Some would turn up for camps with no packed lunch. Very quickly we learned we had to feed them because the coaches were having to give them their lunches.\n\"People will go to me, 'it's the parents' fault' but people out there are struggling with mental health issues or addiction issues.\n\"I think we're easy in this country to blame people. If you see someone struggling it's our job to help the less fortunate.\n\"As a society, I think we can do a lot more.\n\"Areas we work in are areas of high deprivation, the top 5% of every poverty chart you can get.\n\"If we charged \u00a31 we wouldn't have the same success because the money is not there.\"\nAs a former professional with Dundee United, Kilmarnock, Reading and Morton, McLaren is keen not only to give children of a similar background to his a chance, he also wants them to learn from his mistakes.\nThose mistakes took the form of a reliance on alcohol and drugs through much of his playing career. He did that as he couldn't cope with a harrowing experience as a child.\nMcLaren was abused at a young age by someone in his local community. Ultimately, it brought him to the point of almost taking his own life.\nShame, fear, embarrassment, blaming himself and the dressing room environment had all prevented him from unburdening himself for decades.\nFootball was his salvation rather than part of the problem.\n\"Some nights I'd be struggling,\" he admitted. \"I didn't know how to deal with what I was dealing with.\n\"I wasn't taking them (drugs and alcohol) socially. I was taking them for effect.\n\"It wasn't as if anyone forced me to do anything. I was a willing participant. I enjoyed it.\"\nMcLaren believes a failed drug test while playing at Reading saved his life, as did the support of the English FA who paid for him to rehabilitate at the Priory clinic.\nHe was talented, won a Scottish Cup with Dundee United, and remarkably battled back after falling from grace to win a Scotland cap. He may have had more.\nThankfully, for all the negatives of his own experience, there's a positive outcome which is benefiting children growing up in areas like he did.", "summary": "Scotland widely bemoans a lack of footballing talent emerging to match the stars of yesteryear.", "id": "39326930", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\n\"I'm not saying I'm a role model,\" he said. \"I'm not saying I'm a good guy.

His comrades were shot in their command centre, where four others were injured.\nThe inquest in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, concluded that there was no evidence of failure to properly protect the men.\nWiltshire coroner David Ridley said: \"I am satisfied that all three were killed as a result of the actions of the member of the Afghan National Army (ANA).\"\nThe inquest heard that Sgt Talib Hussein, 23, of the ANA, shot Maj Bowman, 34, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, dead in his sleeping quarters in Patrol Base 3 (PB3) in Nahr-e Saraj district, near Helmand's capital, Lashkar Gah.\nUsing an Afghan-issue light machine gun, an M16 rifle and a grenade launcher, he then fired into the base's command centre, killing Lt Turkington, 26, from Craigavon, Northern Ireland, and Cpl Pun, 33, from Nepal, before escaping.\nPost-mortem examinations found all three soldiers had died from gunshot wounds, the inquest was told.\nBy Nick HighamBBC News\nThe key question facing the inquest was this: had the army done all it could to protect the men from the risks posed by the Afghan National Army soldiers with whom they were embedded at Patrol Base 3 in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand?\nTheir commanding officer, Lt Col Strickland, told the inquest the external threats posed by Taliban insurgents were far greater than the threat from inside the base, and that his men would have been at greater risk if they had not sought to build mutual trust and respect in partnership with the Afghan National Army.\nThe inquest heard there had been friction between the British and Afghan troops, including a row over bottled water following which the Gurkhas' Hindu temple was vandalised.\nBut Maj Bowman, the base commander, had not been concerned. And the inquest was told that nothing about the assailant himself, Talib Hussein, remotely suggested that he posed a risk.\nThe coroner concluded there was no evidence of any systematic failure by the army in its duty to protect its soldiers while they were on a British base.\nMr Ridley accepted the Army had a duty to protect those on the base under the European Convention for Human Rights but said he saw no evidence it had failed to do so.\n\"One must guard against hindsight,\" he said.\n\"In this case the possibility of an ANA attack was known but it was never perceived at any level, either by those based at PB3 or higher up, as a real risk, an actual risk.\"\nSpeaking of Hussein, Mr Ridley said: \"The general perception was that he was a quiet individual but (he) had the respect of those with the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf).\"\nHe was one of the better members of the ANA, with nothing to suggest he posed a safety risk, the coroner said.\nAfter the inquest, Lt Turkington's father, Ivor, said he was pleased at the judge's acknowledgement of the Army's duties in relation to the human rights of personnel on bases outside the UK.\nThe Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission had backed him in raising the point.\nIts director Virginia McVea said the ruling would have a \"major impact\" on future inquests.\n\"It ensures a fuller investigation where there is a suggestion of systemic failures to protect soldiers' lives,\" she said.\nBrig Richard Felton, then commander of Taskforce Helmand, had told the inquest that his main concern was the \"thousands and thousands\" of attacks on bases from insurgent forces.\nJonathan Laidlaw QC, representing the family of Lt Turkington, told the brigadier they were concerned that no steps had been taken prior to the attack to prepare the troops for the threat from ANA soldiers.\nBrig Felton said: \"There was no evidence for the threat. We had been living cheek-by-jowl with the ANA for four years with no incident.\"\nHe said the relationship between the British troops and their ANA counterparts depended on trust.\n\"If you are facing real and present danger then you have to have that trust and you do not build up that trust by putting up physical barriers where it's not appropriate.\"\nNothing suggested that Hussein was a member of the Taliban who had infiltrated the ANA, the inquest heard.\nHowever, after the killings, a man calling himself Talib Hussein contacted the BBC bureau in Kabul to claim he carried out the killings, saying he had been angry at the conduct of British troops and that he had acted alone.\nHe said he had joined the Taliban after the attack.\nCapt Peter Houlton-Hart told the Trowbridge inquest he thought Talib Hussein may have been threatened with retribution if he did not carry out the attack.", "summary": "Three soldiers were unlawfully killed by a rogue Afghan soldier in Helmand in July 2010, an inquest has ruled.", "id": "14334027", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe inquest heard that Sgt Talib Hussein, 23, of the ANA, shot Maj Bowman, 34, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, dead in his sleeping quarters in Patrol", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe inquest heard that Sgt Talib Hussein, 23, of the ANA, shot Maj Bowman, 34, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, dead in his sleeping quarters in Patrol", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe inquest heard that Sgt Talib Hussein, 23, of the ANA, shot Maj Bowman, 34, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, dead in his sleeping quarters in Patrol", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe inquest heard that Sgt Talib Hussein, 23, of the ANA, shot Maj Bowman, 34, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, dead in his sleeping quarters in Patrol", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe inquest heard that Sgt Talib Hussein, 23, of the ANA, shot Maj Bowman, 34, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, dead in his sleeping quarters in Patrol", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\nThe inquest heard that Maj Bowman was shot as he slept.

Ever since, the founder of the Huffington Post has championed the need for more sleep - and sales of mattresses have soared.\nOf course there is no scientific proof that Huffington's catch phrase \"sleep your way to the top\" has done anything more than raise a laugh. But it certainly hasn't harmed businesses whose profits rely on Americans spending more time with their eyes closed.\n\"She's done wonders for our industry,\" says Mary Helen Rogers, spokeswoman for the International Sleep Products Association. \"For years she's been talking about the importance of sleep, and I think the trend is changing and people are starting to take better care of themselves.\"\nFigures from ISPA show that the number of mattresses and bed foundations sold in 2015 rose by 4.5%. Revenue was also up by 6.8%. Queen beds were the most popular.\n\"For a long time people were taking a quick fix or a short cut to a better night's sleep. Today a lot more people are thinking about what they're sleeping on, investing in better mattresses and spending time to get a mattress that's right for them,\" says Rogers.\nBefore her wake-up call, Huffington was one of several high profile figures who claimed to thrive on just a few hours of sleep a night.\nFormer British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously said \"sleep is for wimps,\" and ever since, a long line of successful politicians and business people have been giving the impression that she may have been right.\nYahoo's boss, Marissa Mayer is said to sleep for just four hours - as did former President Bill Clinton before he suffered heart problems.\nBritish businessman and billionaire Richard Branson gets by on five hours while the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims to sleep for just one hour while on the campaign trail.\nBut all that is changing as the health problems associated with sleep deprivation become clearer.\n\"It goes beyond physical health,\" says Virginia-based sleep clinician Terry Cralle. \"Now we see how sleep affects psychological health and every aspect of our lives. I think people are finally sitting up - or waking up - and taking notice.\"\nMost people spend a third of their lives in bed - assuming they're getting the recommended eight hours sleep a night.\n\"99.9% of patients who walk through my door ask me about mattresses,\" says Cralle. \"It's critically important to sleep quality. It's a performance tool.\"\nBut she says there's no such thing as one size fits all. Finding the perfect mattress depends on body size, age, who you're sleeping with and any pre-existing health conditions or injuries.\n\"There are so many incredible options out there now. If a consumer hasn't been mattress shopping in the last three years they're going to be amazed at the offerings and how they can be individualised,\" she says.\nThe Better Sleep Council (BSC), a mattress industry group,  says consumers should think about replacing their mattress every five to seven years.\nBut surveys show that most people still see them as an expensive investment and expect them to last much longer.\nMillennials are more receptive to the message because they're most concerned about pests and allergens in older mattresses.\nA 2008 poll from the BSC suggested 9% of Americans link mattress quality to good health and well-being with women more likely than men to recognize the benefits. Most people also think that back problems can be avoided by sleeping on a good mattress.\nBut price remains an issue. The BSC says the perceived cost of a mattress has almost doubled since it began tracking consumer data in 1996 - from $498 to $929 (\u00c2\u00a3373 to \u00c2\u00a3697). However, the majority of consumers believe the more you pay, the better the mattress.\nEntrepreneurs are taking note of the expanding market.\nNew York based Casper launched in 2014 in an effort to meet the demand for mattresses that are often too big to get through the door or up the stairs of city homes.\nThe latex memory foam mattresses are made in the US and compressed into boxes for easy handling. Compression also cuts the cost of shipping and the company keeps prices lower by selling exclusively online. The mattresses spring back to full size when the box is opened.\n\"When we launched we had no idea how big the company was going to be,\" says Neil Parikh, Casper co-founder. \"We ended up selling a $1m worth of mattresses in our first month. We expected it to take years to sell that.\"\nThe trend in sleeping more is also benefiting other industries. Rogers says more people are wearing fitness trackers to monitor the quality and duration of sleep.\n\"It's now cooler to say that I'm getting that seven to eight hours sleep I really should,\" she says.\nAnd Arianna Huffington is continuing her mission to improve the nation's slumber - her new book, The Sleep Revolution, was published in April.", "summary": "If the US mattress industry had a patron saint it would probably be Arianna Huffington.", "id": "36946051", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington has championed the need for more sleep - and sales of mattresses have soared.\nOf course there is no scientific proof that Huffington's catch phrase \"sleep your", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington has championed the need for more sleep - and sales of mattresses have soared.\nOf course there is no scientific proof that Huffington's catch phrase \"sleep your", "decode_al_15_be_01_lay_2": "\nThe Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington has championed the need for more sleep - and sales of mattresses have soared.\nOf course there is no scientific proof that Huffington's catch phrase \"sleep your", "decode_al_05_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington has championed the need for more sleep - and sales of mattresses have soared.\nOf course there is no scientific proof that Huffington's catch phrase \"sleep your", "decode_al_1_be_01_lay_3": "\nThe Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington has championed the need for more sleep - and sales of mattresses have soared.\nOf course there is no scientific proof that Huffington's catch phrase \"sleep your", "decode_al_05_be_08_lay_1": "\n\"The Sleep Revolution\" is a book by Arianna Huffington, published in April 2016.
